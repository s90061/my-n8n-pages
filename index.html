            <h1>Hou Wen-yong's New Project Stops Filming, Loses Millions; Shao Yu-wei Stressed, Causes Hormonal Imbalance</h1>
            <p>Writer Hou Wen-yong is also the producer and scriptwriter for the TV series "People Floating in Love." The show had to stop filming because of the pandemic, and some actors were changed. Hou Wen-yong said today that they lost about 20 to 30 million NT dollars. Shao Yu-wei was so stressed that her hormones became unbalanced.</p>
            <p>The TV series "People Floating in Love" was shown as a "mystery screening" at this year's Kaohsiung Film Festival. Hou Wen-yong, director Xu Fu-jun, producer Ke Yi-sen, and actors Shao Yu-wei and Fan Shao-shun came to talk about filming.</p>
            <p>Hou Wen-yong said that when they lost money, he felt worried. But he decided to accept it and keep looking for more money. He said it was hard, but he always takes the harder path. He also joked that he didn't borrow money from his wife, who is a dentist. He said, "Because she is a producer, I confidently asked her to invest more." About the team, he said, "Life is not perfect! The best result is that this show could finally be finished."</p>
            <p>Shao Yu-wei joined the project for the new version. She joked that she moved from the "younger group" to the "older group." She said, "I saw the first version a little bit. The second version has different character details, but the main story is similar." Her boyfriend, Wu Kang-ren, was only in the first version. She said they keep their work and relationship separate and don't talk about work.</p>
            <p>Shao Yu-wei said she was so stressed during filming that her hormones and period became irregular. She also looked a bit swollen on camera and even had skin allergies. Her manager thought she looked "terrible" at that time. Hou Wen-yong said that Shao Yu-wei asked him for help to understand her character. He told her to watch the movie "Killing Eve" for ideas.</p>
            <p>Fan Shao-shun has been in the show since the first version. He said his original character was a rich ABC (American-Born Chinese) and the accent made him feel a bit pressured. The new version fits him better.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Kaohsiung Film Festival is happening from now until October 26.</p>

            <h1>To Fight China's Control of Supply, British Media: US Spends $1 Billion to Store Key Minerals</h1>
            <p>The US Department of Defense, also called the Pentagon, has started a plan to store important minerals. They plan to buy up to $1 billion worth of these minerals. This is to reduce China's strong position in supplying key metals for making defense products.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times, a British newspaper, reported that public papers from the US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) show that the Trump government is quickly increasing its national storage of these minerals. China has controlled the supply of many important minerals and materials for making strong magnets for a long time. China also limits how much of these minerals can be sent out of the country. These minerals are needed for things like smartphones and fighter jets.</p>
            <p>A former defense official said that this plan to buy up to $1 billion of minerals is much faster than past storage plans.</p>
            <p>Recently, the DLA announced its plans to buy: up to $500 million of cobalt, up to $245 million of antimony from a US company called US Antimony Corporation, up to $100 million of tantalum from an unannounced US company, and $45 million of scandium from Rio Tinto and APL Engineered Materials in Illinois, USA.</p>
            <p>A top person in the industry said these plans show that the US government "knows how important these minerals are and wants to help local companies produce them." He added, "For Western governments, storing key minerals is just starting, but they are paying more attention to it."</p>
            <p>This week, China announced new rules to control the export of rare earth minerals and related technology. After this news, Trump announced on October 10 that his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, planned for the end of the month, would be canceled. He also said the US would add an extra 100% tax on goods imported from China.</p>
            <p>For the Pentagon, key minerals are very important for national safety. This is because these minerals are vital for almost all weapon systems. They are also needed for technology like radar and missile detection systems.</p>
            <p>Stephanie Barna, a lawyer in Washington D.C., said, "If China stops supplying these key minerals, the US will have big problems using its high-tech military. This is very important for any competition or conflict between countries."</p>
            <p>The DLA stores many types of alloys, metals, rare earths, ores, and precious metals in different warehouses across the US. In 2023, the value of these stored materials was $1.3 billion. These stored materials cannot be used unless the President declares war, or the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment believes they are needed for defense.</p>
            <p>Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBA) set aside $7.5 billion for key minerals. Out of this, $2 billion is for increasing defense storage. The Department of Defense expects to use all this money by the end of 2026 or early 2027.</p>
            <p>The OBBA also provides $5 billion for the Department of Defense to invest in the supply chain for key minerals. And it sets aside $500 million for a Department of Defense loan program to encourage related investments.</p>
            <p>A former defense official said that after the OBBA was passed, the different groups responsible for keeping the key mineral supply chain safe now have "plenty of money."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Oldest Student Group in UK Celebrates 50 Years; Jiang Ya-chi Encourages Them to Be a Bridge</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Student Union in the UK (SUROCUK) celebrated its 50th birthday with a dinner in London on October 11. Jiang Ya-chi, the Deputy Representative to the UK, spoke at the event. She said that Taiwanese students studying abroad are an important link between Taiwan and the UK. They can help Taiwan in many different areas and when meeting people from various backgrounds.</p>
            <p>SUROCUK is one of the oldest Taiwanese student groups outside of Taiwan. It is also the only "general association" for students among all countries. In other countries, Taiwanese student groups are often separate groups. But in the UK, the SUROCUK president is chosen by votes from over 30 student group leaders from all over the UK at their yearly meeting in London. This president then leads all other Taiwanese student groups in the UK.</p>
            <p>SUROCUK will choose its new president today. The new president will serve for one year. This year, a record number of four people are running for president. During the election, each person will talk about their plans for about 15 minutes. Then, they will answer questions alone for about 10 minutes. Finally, there will be a group question and answer session that usually lasts at least 40 minutes. After the president is chosen, SUROCUK will start looking for up to 30 new staff members.</p>
            <p>SUROCUK has 7 departments. This year, they started a new "Career Development Department." This department will hold talks and workshops to share career experiences and offer career advice. Bi Zu-an, the head of the Education Division at the Taiwan Representative Office in the UK, has 30 years of international work experience. He spoke at the dinner and said that over the past 50 years, SUROCUK has changed. It used to mainly help students and support the Representative Office. But in the last 10 years, it has become a very independent group. It is now enthusiastic and able to make many new partnerships and be part of local life.</p>
            <p>Over 60 current and past presidents and staff members from student groups all over the UK and SUROCUK attended the dinner on October 11. During the dinner, a short video was shown. It had good wishes and shared experiences from past SUROCUK presidents. The video started with Hu Chih-chiang, a co-founder of SUROCUK and former Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p>Hu Chih-chiang, who earned his master's and doctoral degrees in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s, encouraged the younger students to finish their studies soon and return to Taiwan to use their skills.</p>
            <p>Jiang Ya-chi also got her degree in the UK. When she spoke at the dinner, she first shared her own story. She said that when she walked into the dinner, she remembered her first time studying in the UK 20 years ago. She clearly remembered the challenges she faced in her daily life and studies, as well as the cultural and art events she enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Jiang Ya-chi said that when you are abroad, every time you talk to someone from another country, it can be a "diplomatic moment." She hopes that Taiwanese students in the UK will help the UK understand Taiwan better. She also hopes that after they finish their studies, whether they go back to Taiwan or not, they can help Taiwan in a good way in many different fields.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the number of Taiwanese students studying in the UK has grown steadily. Data from the UK's Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) shows that there were 3,695 Taiwanese students in UK universities in the 2021-2022 academic year. In 2022-2023, there were 4,210 students. And in the 2023-2024 academic year, there were 4,380 students.</p>
