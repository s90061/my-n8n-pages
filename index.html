Pop star Justin Bieber's new album, "Swag," is out today, July 11th, after he shared a preview online yesterday. The hashtag #SWAGOUTNOW quickly became popular on the social media platform X.

This is Justin Bieber's seventh album. His last album, "Justice," was released in 2021. After releasing a song called "Honest" with Don Toliver in spring 2022, he had been quiet and mostly out of the public eye.

For the past few months, fans have been waiting for his new album. "Swag" marks the 31-year-old singer's return to music after more than three years. The album quickly became a trending topic on social media, showing how excited fans are.

Yesterday, Justin Bieber posted a video on his Instagram showing the "Swag" song list on a big screen in Times Square, New York City. Posters for "Swag" also appeared on the streets of Reykjavik, Iceland, this week. Reports say Justin Bieber finished the album there in April.

"Swag" has 21 songs and is 54 minutes long. Justin Bieber worked with American rappers such as Gunna, Lil B, and Cash Cobain on this album.

In June 2022, Justin Bieber announced he had Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, which caused partial facial paralysis. He had to cancel 82 shows of his world tour. Last August, he and his wife Hailey announced they were having their first child.

**US Media: US and Vietnam Did Not Agree on Tariffs, Trump Changed from 11% to 20%**

According to POLITICO, a US political news organization, Vietnam thought they had a basic agreement with the US to greatly lower tariffs. But then, President Trump suddenly increased the tariff rate at the last moment.

POLITICO reported that Trump posted on social media last week saying that Vietnam's leader, Nguyen Phu Trong, had agreed to the terms. However, four people who know about the situation said that the Vietnamese government has not officially accepted the main parts of the deal.

Because neither the US nor Vietnam has released documents about the agreement, it's unclear if they truly reached a deal.

On July 2nd, Trump announced the agreement on his social media platform "Truth Social." This made Vietnam seem like the second country to avoid the high tariffs that started on April 2nd. According to his post, tariffs on goods from Vietnam to the US would drop from 46% to 20%. If the goods were not made in Vietnam, the tariff would be 40%.

Trump wrote then that Vietnam "will open their markets to the United States, meaning we will be able to sell American goods to Vietnam with zero tariffs."

The four sources said that this sudden change caused problems in Vietnam. The Vietnamese negotiators, who had not agreed to a 20% tariff, thought the rate would be around 11%. When Trump spoke with Nguyen Phu Trong, who was not part of the first tariff talks, he did not consider the 11% figure and announced a rate that was almost double.

A lobbyist in Washington who works with Vietnam and other Asian governments said that some people in the US were also surprised, including outside groups who were watching the talks.

The lobbyist said, "Trump tricked everyone." The reaction from the Vietnamese government was described as "surprised, disappointed, and angry."

An unnamed White House staff member disagreed, saying that the Vietnamese government knew about the highest tariff rate before the call. This staff member said, "My understanding is that the trade teams almost finished the deal, and then the leaders of both sides made the final decision."

However, neither the US nor Vietnam has released any documents showing the tariff rates or a final agreement, and neither country has officially signed a deal. It is still unclear when or if this higher tariff rate will start.

Spokespeople for Vietnam's Communist Party, the US Trade Representative, and the US Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

**Jiekuo FinTech Shares Controversy, Hu Yi-chia: Will Seek Solution with Tayih**

A disagreement over share transactions between Jiekuo FinTech and Tayih has caused problems. Hu Yi-chia, the chairman of Jiekuo FinTech, said tonight that even though Jiekuo FinTech has appealed to a higher court, they will immediately try to find a solution with Tayih. He hopes they can avoid more legal battles and solve their differences quickly.

Tayih's new management team said that the decision to invest NT$3.6 billion in Jiekuo FinTech was not valid. They asked for the money back and were allowed to get it. They have put up a guarantee to carry out the ruling. On July 10th, the Taipei District Court went to seal Jiekuo FinTech's assets but did not get results yet. This issue has also made people lose trust in Jiekou Pay.

Hu Yi-chia, the chairman of Jiekuo FinTech and founder of Jiekou Pay, spoke on Facebook tonight. He said he was sorry for the recent problems, which came from a civil court decision about Jiekuo FinTech and Tayih that was not what they expected. This has caused public concern and taken up news space.

Hu Yi-chia stressed that Jiekou Pay is a financial institution managed by the Financial Supervisory Commission. It has good management. All money for users and businesses can only be handled by the custody bank and is fully trusted. Jiekuo or anyone else cannot touch it, so it is completely safe. He hopes that some false information will stop, and he is very thankful that many businesses were not affected by the false rumors.

He said that even though there are many questions about the first court decision for Jiekuo FinTech, and regardless of any intentional media actions, as a financial institution, they have more responsibility. No factor should affect the trust of users and businesses. Therefore, even though Jiekuo FinTech has appealed to a higher court, they will immediately try to find a solution with Tayih. He hopes they can avoid more legal battles and solve their differences quickly.
