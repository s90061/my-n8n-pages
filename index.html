            <h1>Glaser says "America doubt" is spreading in Taiwan and worries China will use it to push for unification.</h1>
            <p>An American expert named Bonnie Glaser used survey data to warn that "America doubt" is growing stronger in Taiwan. If this doubt spreads, it could harm America's interests and make allies in the Indo-Pacific region trust the US less. It could also give China a chance to convince Taiwanese people that "unification might be the best or only choice."</p>
            <p>Today, the "German Marshall Fund" (GMF), a think tank in Washington D.C., published an article titled "Taiwan's Increasing Distrust of the United States." It was written by Bonnie Glaser, who is the head of GMF's Indo-Pacific program, and her intern Lan Li-ya.</p>
            <p>They wrote that Taiwanese people's good feelings towards the United States are decreasing. After Russia fully attacked Ukraine in 2022, the Biden government chose not to send soldiers to help. This made some people question if the US could be trusted.</p>
            <p>Now, this feeling is coming back and spreading. Taiwanese people are worried that TSMC building more factories in the United States will make Taiwan less important for its safety. They also fear it might even increase the risk of China attacking Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Many surveys show that negative feelings and distrust towards the US are growing among Taiwanese people. Confidence in the US providing help if there is a conflict in the Taiwan Strait is also going down.</p>
            <p>A report from the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington D.C., looked at surveys done in Taiwan from February to April. It found that 40.5% of people surveyed had a negative view of the United States. This is higher than the 24.2% who had a negative view in July 2024.</p>
            <p>This report also said that the number of people who believe the US is not a trustworthy friend went up by 13.9 percentage points.</p>
            <p>In March of this year, a survey called "American Portrait" by Academia Sinica's Institute of European and American Studies showed that 59.6% of people surveyed did not trust the United States. This was almost 10 percentage points more than the year before. In both surveys, more than 40% of the people surveyed said they thought the United States would probably not or definitely not get involved if a war happened in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Glaser and Lan Li-ya pointed out that Trump's tariffs on Taiwan may be the main reason for the damage to the US image. A survey by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation in mid-April showed that 81.9% of those surveyed thought these tariffs were unfair. As many as 86.4% thought these tariffs would hurt Taiwan's economy seriously or moderately.</p>
            <p>According to the article, many people believe that the Trump government pressured TSMC to build 6 chip factories in the US to hurt Taiwan's leading position in making semiconductors for the world. This also hurt America's reputation. A survey by Global Views Research in March showed that most Taiwanese people think TSMC's decision to make advanced chips in the US makes the "silicon shield" that protects Taiwan from a Chinese attack weaker.</p>
            <p>The article warns that if the change in public opinion in Taiwan continues or gets worse, it could harm US interests. Growing worry might lead to disappointment about the future. This gives China a chance to move forward with its long-term plan, which is to convince Taiwanese people that the best, or even only, choice is to unite with China on Beijing's terms.</p>
            <p>This feeling of sadness could also make China take more risky actions to force unification. For example, they might challenge Taiwan's control over nearby waters, create a blockade, or take over small islands.</p>
            <p>Also, US partners in the Indo-Pacific like Australia, Japan, and the Philippines are carefully watching how the US acts on the Taiwan issue. They see it as a way to know if the US will keep its promises about their safety. If the people of Taiwan lose faith in the US, these allies might also start to doubt if the US will keep its word.</p>
            <p>At the end of their article, Glaser and Lan Li-ya offered several suggestions to the US. These include making sure that talks between the US and China do not lead to outcomes that threaten Taiwan's safety or success. They also suggest clearly stating that Taiwan is very important to the US, for example, through a major speech by the president to get support from American people to defend Taiwan if it is attacked.</p>
            <p>Other suggestions include approving and making sure that weapons that are hard for the enemy to fight against are delivered on time. They also suggest making it easier for Taiwan's president to travel through the US, instead of setting limits. This would reduce the worries of Taiwanese people about China's efforts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Also, on the topic of the Taiwanese president's travel, the US government has always followed the principle of "safety, comfort, convenience, and dignity," and this should continue to be done as usual.</p>
            <p>The article also said that the US should continue to send congressional groups to visit Taiwan. This would show again America's promise to support Taiwan's democracy, success, and safety.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy: Ukraine is ready to hold elections if the war ends and it is safe.</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that his country is willing to hold elections. This would happen if the war with Russia ends and if it is safe to hold them.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelenskyy made these comments during a press conference in the Oval Office. This was before his important meeting with US President Trump. The two leaders discussed how to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has been going on for three and a half years since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine.</p>
            <p>When a reporter asked if he would agree to hold elections, which Trump had mentioned many times, Zelenskyy said, "Yes, of course, we are willing to hold elections, yes. We must keep safety, and we must do some work in Parliament, because during a war, you cannot hold elections."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that there must be a ceasefire. This would allow Ukrainian people to take part in fair, open, and legal elections.</p>
            <p>Currently, Ukraine has temporarily stopped elections because of martial law.</p>
            <p>The two leaders spoke politely in front of the media. This was different from their very tense meeting in the Oval Office in February. However, Trump did make Zelenskyy feel a bit uncomfortable at one point.</p>
            <p>Trump interrupted Zelenskyy, saying, "So you are saying that during the war you cannot hold elections?"</p>
            <p>He smiled and added, "So, let me put it this way, after 3.5 years, you mean if we happen to be at war with someone, there will be no more elections?"</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy quickly laughed and replied, "No, it's not like that."</p>

            <h1>US Secretary of State Rubio cancels 6,000 student visas in 7 months.</h1>
            <p>The US Department of State announced today that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cancelled 6,000 student visas. This happened in the seven months since he took office.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Rubio used a part of the law that is not very clear. This part allows him to cancel visas for people who he thinks are working against US foreign policy. He did this to please President Trump's strong right-wing supporters.</p>
            <p>The Trump government also tried to send away many people who were living in the United States without permission.</p>
            <p>An official from the State Department said, "The State Department has cancelled over 6,000 student visas. This was because people stayed longer than their visas allowed and broke laws. Most of these cases were for violent behavior, drunk driving, stealing, and supporting terrorism."</p>
            <p>The official said that about 4,000 of these visas were cancelled because of breaking laws.</p>
            <p>The State Department did not cancel visas based on a person's country of origin. However, Rubio had promised to specifically target students from China.</p>
            <p>In March, Rubio told the media that he cancels student visas every day. When talking about "radical students," he said, "Every time I find any of these crazy people, I will cancel their visas."</p>
            <p>Rubio specifically mentioned students who protested against Israel. He accused them of being activists who are against Jewish people. But the students who were accused denied these claims.</p>
