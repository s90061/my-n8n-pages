            <h1>US Commerce Secretary Talks "50-50" Chip Production in Taiwan Trade Deal</h1>
            <p>Howard Lutnick, the US Commerce Secretary, recently said that the US will make a trade deal with Taiwan. He keeps suggesting a "50-50" plan for making computer chips, meaning the US and Taiwan would each produce half. He also spoke against the idea of a "silicon shield," saying that if the US has enough chips at home, it can better protect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>"This is a very important agreement, and it is coming soon. I think we will start talking with them (Taiwan) and solve this quickly," Lutnick said in an interview with the US news channel NewsNation.</p>
            <p>When asked what the US wants from a trade deal with Taiwan, he explained that 95% of the chips in mobile phones and cars are made in Taiwan. Taiwan is 9,000 miles away and only 80 miles from China. Beijing has openly said it wants to take Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He said the Trump government's goal is to move a lot of chip manufacturing to the US so it can make its own chips. "If you can't make your own chips, how can you protect yourself?" he asked.</p>
            <p>Lutnick noted that when he became Commerce Secretary, only 2% of chips used in the US were made there. His goal before leaving office is to reach 40%. Many thought this was almost impossible, needing more than 500 billion US dollars (about 15.2392 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) and a full supply chain, but it is still his goal.</p>
            <p>"So, getting Taiwan to join and agree to be part of the supply chain, that is the magic of the Trump government."</p>
            <p>He said this is not a natural choice for Taiwan. Taiwan naturally thinks, "We make 95%, and we are happy." But Trump would say, "This is not good for you, and not good for us. Because we protect you, and if you want us to keep protecting you, you must help us become reasonably self-sufficient."</p>
            <p>Taiwan worries about losing its "silicon shield" protection, which might mean the US would be less likely to protect Taiwan if China takes military action. Lutnick said his argument is: if Taiwan has 95% of the chips, how would the US get those chips to protect Taiwan? Would they fly them over or ship them? The US must rely less on Taiwan's chips.</p>
            <p>Therefore, he suggested the "50-50" idea to Taiwan: the US makes half, and Taiwan makes half. Lutnick said that even then, the US would still deeply rely on Taiwan, "because we cannot live without the other half." But if the US has half the chips, it can do what it needs to do.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that this is how the US thinks, and it tells Taiwan that it is very important for the US to make 50% of its own chips. Currently, Taiwan produces 95% of the world's chips. Achieving "50-50" will need a lot of talking, but it is what the US is working towards.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's temporary 20% equal tariffs have started. Lutnick first announced on September 11 that a big deal with Taiwan would be made. The next day, Taiwan's Office of Trade Negotiations said that tariff talks between Taiwan and the US are still moving forward, and they are waiting for the US to set up a final meeting.</p>

            <h1>Shooting and Fire at Michigan Church Kills 2, Wounds 9; Gunman Dead</h1>
            <p>Police in the US say that a church in Grand Blanc, Michigan, was attacked with gunfire and fire today. At least 2 people died and 9 were hurt. The shooter was a man from Michigan, and he was killed. US President Trump has posted about this event.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that authorities said the gunman drove his car into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as the Mormon Church) during a large service. He then started shooting, and after that, the church caught fire.</p>
            <p>Sources told CNN that some people were seriously hurt, and children were among the injured.</p>
            <p>Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said the fire has been put out. Police believe the shooter started the fire on purpose. "Investigators are still trying to find out when the fire started and what caused it." He also thinks that more dead people might be found once officers can safely enter the church.</p>
            <p>Renye also said that the shooter was killed after fighting with police officers. He was identified as a 40-year-old man from Michigan.</p>
            <p>Grand Blanc is about an hour's drive north of Detroit, a big city in Michigan.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that US President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform "Truth Social" today, calling the event "very terrible." He also said, "The killer is dead, but many details are still unclear. This seems to be another attack aimed at American Christians."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press quoted local police saying that there is no longer any danger to the public from this incident.</p>
