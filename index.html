It's easy to use a lot of plastic every day. But small changes can make a big difference. For example, instead of buying water in plastic bottles, use a reusable water bottle. You can also use cloth bags for groceries instead of plastic bags from the store. When you buy food, choose products with less packaging. Also, try making your own cleaning products. Many simple recipes use ingredients like vinegar and baking soda, which are better for the environment and your health. These small changes can help reduce plastic waste and make your home more eco-friendly.

This means having a specific area in your home just for work, away from distractions. Another tip is to schedule breaks throughout the day. Get up, walk around, and stretch. It's also important to communicate with your team. Regular video calls can help you feel connected and stay on track. By trying these strategies, you can improve your focus and be more productive while working from home.
