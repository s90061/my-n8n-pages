A British newspaper, the Financial Times, said today that the US military is asking Japan and Australia to say what they would do if the US and China fought a war over Taiwan. This request has made these two important US friends in Asia unhappy.

The newspaper reported that Elbridge Colby, a US defense official, has been talking about this with defense leaders from Japan and Australia. Japan and Australia were surprised by this request because the US has not promised to protect Taiwan without any conditions.

The US does not officially recognize Taiwan as a country, but it sends weapons to Taiwan. China is increasing its military pressure on Taiwan. Taiwan says no to China's claims. Japan's defense ministry said it is hard to answer questions about a possible war. They added that any action would follow their country's laws.

**Civics Exam: Different Ideas on Difficulty, Gender Topics Stand Out**

The Civics exam for the school subject test finished today. Different teachers and groups have different opinions about how difficult it was. But many liked that the questions were about real life, especially topics about gender equality.

These questions talked about work, taking care of family, and what it means to be unemployed. One group of teachers thought that average students would get higher scores this year. This is because there were more questions that tested what students learned, and fewer questions that just needed reading. They said this was a good change.

However, another teacher group thought the exam was "medium to a little hard." They said some questions needed students to understand texts deeply and think more. The National Teachers' Association also said the exam was harder than last year overall. There were also a few questions that people debated, especially one about how having children affects a family's income, and how men's and women's incomes change.
