            <h1>114th Rice Masters: Hualien-Taitung Gold Medal Winners Rely on Technology to Fight Climate Challenges</h1>
            <p>The Council of Agriculture's Agriculture and Food Agency announced the results of the "114th Taiwan Rice Master Selection" today and presented awards. The agency praised two gold medal winners from the Hualien-Taitung area, showing that agricultural resilience can overcome climate challenges through technology.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture and Food Agency said that the "Taiwan Rice Master Selection" has been held since 2017. This year, 768 rice farmers from 47 townships applied, and 77 people reached the national finals. All rice in the finals had its packaging changed and was given new numbers. It was then tested blindly for weight, crude protein content, appearance, quality of brown (white) rice, and taste. It is the most important national competition for rice producers.</p>
            <p>The agency said that this year's competition was very hard. Typhoons and heavy rain made parts of the rice sprout on the ear, and the grains easily broke. The quality of the rice was tested. Farmers who reached the national competition are already the best rice growers in their areas.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture and Food Agency announced 20 winners, including one gold medal, two silver medals, three bronze medals, and four honorable mentions for both fragrant rice and non-fragrant rice groups.</p>
            <p>The agency said that the gold medal winners showed great control over rice varieties, climate, soil, and pest and disease control. This proved that agriculture can be strong against climate challenges by using technology.</p>
            <p>The gold medal winner for fragrant rice was Huang Chih-hung from Fuli Township Farmers' Association in Hualien County. He is a young farmer who returned to his hometown. In 2018, he came back to farm with his father and brother. He said that the hardest part of growing rice is dealing with rice blast disease. It needs a lot of care. He thanked agricultural groups for their advice, which helped him improve his skills. He is sure that Taiwan can grow the best-tasting rice in the world.</p>
            <p>The gold medal winner for non-fragrant rice was Huang Ming-chueh from Chishang Township Farmers' Association in Taitung. She used to work in an office and has been growing rice for 30 years since returning home. She said that pests and diseases are the biggest problem for rice farming. Besides technical guidance from agricultural departments, farmers also share their experiences with each other. Huang Ming-chueh was excited and surprised to win the rice championship for the first time. She said she spends almost all day in the rice fields.</p>
            <p>Huang Chao-hsing, the deputy director of the Agriculture and Food Agency, gave awards to the rice masters. He said that this competition encourages better farming methods and helps improve the quality of Taiwan's rice.</p>

            <h1>Environmental Groups Say Taiwan is Biggest Importer of Russian Light Oil; Formosa Petrochemical: We Follow All Rules</h1>
            <p>Environmental groups say Taiwan has become the largest importer of Russian light oil. Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPCC) said today in a statement that they follow all rules. They buy all light oil through open bidding and do not limit where it comes from. However, they strictly require sellers to follow international sanctions and EU rules (CN27101290). The company said that the higher amount of Russian light oil they buy is because of market conditions, not because they changed their buying strategy on purpose.</p>
            <p>Today, the Environmental Rights Foundation, together with the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), Russian environmental group Ecodefense, and German group Urgewald, released a report called "Dangerous Dependence: Taiwan Becomes the World's Largest Buyer of Russian Light Oil, Coal Imports Continue." The report showed that after the war in Ukraine started, Taiwan bought more fossil fuels from Russia. In the first half of this year, Taiwan even became the largest buyer of Russian light oil, importing it for 1.3 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>During the press conference, the environmental groups specifically named FPCC. They said that CPC Corporation, a state-owned company, stopped importing Russian light oil completely in 2024. However, private company FPCC increased its purchases. Now, 90% of its light oil comes from Russia, compared to only 9% before the war.</p>
            <p>In response, FPCC stated that according to its own data, Russian light oil made up about 60% of its total imports in 2024, and about 85% so far in 2025. This is not the 90% that the media reported. If FPCC's own light oil production is included, the actual percentages are about 35% and 48%.</p>
            <p>FPCC emphasized that it is a public company. All its light oil is bought through open bidding, and it does not limit the country of origin. However, it strictly requires sellers to follow international sanctions and EU rules (CN27101290). Also, the people they buy from and the ships used for transport must not be on the US OFAC sanctions list. FPCC also clarified that the light oil it buys follows EU rules, and its price limit is US$100 per barrel, not the US$45 per barrel that was wrongly reported.</p>
            <p>FPCC said that in the past two years, due to world market conditions, many suppliers offered Russian light oil. This caused the amount of Russian light oil they bought to increase. This happened because of market conditions, not because the company changed its buying plans on purpose.</p>
            <p>For exports, FPCC sold about NT$12.4 billion worth of products to the US and European markets in 2024. Of this, oil products made up 92% and petrochemical products made up 8%. The amount of petrochemical products exported was very small. Also, 100% of the crude oil FPCC uses is not from Russia. Therefore, the oil products sold to the US and Europe do not contain any Russian crude oil.</p>
            <p>FPCC stressed that if there are stricter international rules in the future, or if the Taiwanese government bans it, FPCC will follow immediately and cooperate with all related measures.</p>

            <h1>Woman in Taipei Metro Seat Dispute, Caught and Released After Paying NT$15,472</h1>
            <p>A woman in Taipei, Ms. Zeng, recently got into an argument on the MRT when she asked for a priority seat and was kicked. Today, she caused trouble at a convenience store and was arrested by the police. It was found that she was wanted for theft, so she was taken to the prosecutor's office. The Shilin District Prosecutors Office said that today she paid a fine of NT$15,000 and NT$472 from her crime, and then she was released.</p>
            <p>On September 29, around 4 PM, Ms. Zeng, who is 73 years old, was on the Taipei MRT from Xinyi Anhe Station towards Tamsui. She insisted on sitting in a priority seat and argued with a young person who did not want to give up the seat. She then hit the young person's leg with her handbag, and the young person kicked her back. This caused a lot of discussion.</p>
            <p>Today, Ms. Zeng was involved in an incident at a convenience store in Datong District. Police arrested her and found that she had a history of theft and was currently wanted for a crime. She was then taken to the Shilin District Prosecutors Office.</p>
            <p>The Shilin District Prosecutors Office found that Ms. Zeng had finished serving 40 days in jail for a previous sentence. She also had another theft case, and the total jail time for these cases was 55 days. The prosecutor allowed her to pay a fine instead of going to jail. Ms. Zeng paid a fine of NT$15,000 and NT$472 from her crime and was then released.</p>
