        const text = `**Ministry of Economic Affairs: Same Stance as Pingtung County Government, Urging Company to Clean Up**

The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said that its actions are in line with the Pingtung County Government. This is after a media report said the county government was punishing a company for a floating solar power project, which seemed to contradict the MOEA. The MOEA stated that helping in disaster relief is the most important thing. They urged the company to finish cleaning up within 48 hours, following the county government's request.

A media report claimed that a floating solar power system off Pingtung's coast, which received over NT$100 million in government funding, was easily damaged by a typhoon. The MOEA explained on July 8 that this was a "new type of solar experiment" to test how well the floating platforms could handle bad weather. They also said the solar panels were taken off before the typhoon. However, the Pingtung County Government announced the next day that they would fine the company, Xudong, for the project.

The Energy Administration of the MOEA clarified today that the company took the solar panels off the platforms before the typhoon. But because the sea was rough during the typhoon, they could not bring all the floating platforms back. This caused some platforms to break apart and wash up on the shore. So, the Pingtung County Government asked the company to clean up these floating parts within a time limit. This does not mean they are disagreeing with the MOEA.

The Energy Administration stated that after learning about the situation, they quickly told the company to follow the Pingtung County Government's demand to clean up the floating debris on the coast within 48 hours. They are also working closely with the county government. If the Pingtung County Government checks and finds that the floating platforms are not cleaned up, they will fine the company according to relevant laws.

The Energy Administration emphasized that the MOEA and the Pingtung County Government share the same view. They will continue to ensure the company takes responsibility for cleaning up to protect the coastal environment and safety. The Energy Administration repeated that since Typhoon Danas caused serious damage, everyone should focus on disaster relief first. They warned that if there are more false reports trying to cause misunderstandings, they will report it to the police.

**Chung Yuan University Starts Asia-Pacific Student Program to Grow Quantum Talent for the Future**

Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU) will work with the Social Impact Investment Foundation to start a training program for high school and university students in the Asia-Pacific region. This program aims to teach young people in Asia-Pacific about new knowledge for a sustainable Earth. Together, they will train future talent in quantum technology.

CYCU announced today that its Quantum Information Center and the "Social Impact Investment Foundation," an international organization supported by the UN, have signed an agreement. They will work together to create education that combines quantum computing with the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. They will train future young people with a global view and technological skills.

Mr. Chang Kuang-cheng, the chairman of CYCU, said that "quantum technology" is seen as the next big industrial revolution. Having quantum talent is important for industries to grow. CYCU will use all its resources, working with government, industry, universities, research groups, and international organizations. This will help young people connect with the world and make a positive social impact.

Professor Chang Ching-ray, who helped set up this partnership at CYCU, said that both sides will work on a training program for high school and university students in the Asia-Pacific area. This will help young people in the region learn more about working for a sustainable Earth. CYCU has been teaching quantum education in high schools for many years. He believes that sustainability can only happen through "education," and hopes this partnership will last a long time.

Ms. Chuang Ning, a director at the Social Impact Investment Foundation, pointed out that in this time of fast progress in AI and quantum technology, future development needs universities and experts to prepare early. CYCU has strong skills in quantum technology education, and their courses are new and creative. She hopes this can be brought into the UN system to have a bigger impact on education.

The cooperation between CYCU's Quantum Information Center and the Social Impact Investment Foundation includes holding cross-field talks and workshops, running ongoing or yearly education programs, and creating teaching materials and certified courses. They will also co-host the first "AI and Quantum Technology for UN Sustainable Development Goals Workshop" from August 3 to 10 at the United Nations University in Tokyo, Japan.

CYCU stated that students who join the workshop will learn basic quantum programming, practice with AI simulators, and work in teams with students from other countries to present new ideas for the UN SDGs. After the course, they will receive a certificate from the United Nations University, the Social Impact Investment Foundation, and its UN Global Leadership Education Program. More than 10 high school and university students from Taiwan have already signed up to join this international program on quantum technology and sustainable education.

The New Taipei City Education Department announced today that five teachersâ€”Zhang Jia-pei from Sacred Heart Girls' High School, Tsai Yao-te from Yingge Vocational High School, Huang Yao-nan from New Taipei Industrial High School, Zheng Feng-que from Yulin Junior High School, and Yan Zuo-yu from Qingtang Elementary Schoolâ€”have won the Ministry of Education's Xingtan Fangfang Award. These teachers have used their skills and passion to help children grow.

The Education Department stated that the Ministry of Education's K-12 Education Administration announced the "Xingtan Fangfang Award." Five excellent educators from New Taipei received this honor. They have worked in teaching for many years, staying true to their beliefs and showing a warm example of education in New Taipei.

The Education Department said in a press release that Ms. Zhang Jia-pei from Sacred Heart Girls' High School includes the school's goalsâ€”faith, wisdom, care, teamwork, and free developmentâ€”into her geography lessons. She connects them with social issues like period poverty, the circular economy, and food banks. This helps students develop civic awareness and care for society. She also shows respect and understanding, helping students learn with confidence and grow comfortably.

Mr. Tsai Yao-te from Yingge Vocational High School has deeply focused on vocational education. The Education Department said that he led his team to create a full curriculum for the school based on the 108 Curriculum Guidelines. He also connected this with industry needs, helping students get technical certificates, join international exhibitions, and win the Red Dot Design Award. He also started special programs that work with businesses to build career training systems and has cared for students from disadvantaged backgrounds for many years.

Mr. Huang Yao-nan from New Taipei Industrial High School has been teaching for 37 years. He is dedicated to helping new immigrant and disadvantaged students. He also guides students in invention and project work, winning many awards in invention exhibitions and entrepreneurship competitions. He also took students to the New Taipei Tucheng Youth Incubation Base, connecting technical education with starting a business.

The Education Department also mentioned that Ms. Zheng Feng-que has worked at Yulin Junior High School for 30 years and helped start and lead the school's sports class system. She helps students balance their studies and sports training. She once helped a taekwondo student who had family problems get through a difficult time. She is like a "second mother" to her students.

Mr. Yan Zuo-yu, the director at Qingtang Elementary School, brings creativity and good management into education. He has started teaching ideas like "Graduation Film Festival," "Diverse Club Choices," and "Flipping Commemorative Albums." These ideas help students improve their storytelling and creative skills. He also led students to win many awards in national reading and science fair competitions, showing an example of being good at both management and teaching.
