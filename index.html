            <h1>Wildfires in Spain Spread to Europa Mountains, Close Famous Hiking Path</h1>
            <p>Wildfires have been burning in Spain for many days. Today, they reached the south side of the Europa Mountains. The Spanish government announced that some parts of the famous "Camino de Santiago" hiking path are now closed. Many tourists walk this old pilgrimage path every year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Camino de Santiago connects France with Santiago de Compostela, a city in western Spain. It is believed that the remains of St James are buried there. The government of the Castile and Leon area has closed about 50 kilometers of the path between the towns of Astorga and Ponferrada. They told hikers not to put their lives in danger.</p>
            <p>Highways and railways near the Camino de Santiago are also closed. Thousands of tourists come to walk this old pilgrimage path every summer.</p>
            <p>In the past few weeks, about 20 wildfires have started in the Galicia and Castile and Leon areas. A heatwave that lasted 16 days made the fires worse. More than 115,000 hectares of land have been burned.</p>
            <p>Margarita Robles, Spain's Defense Minister, told Cadena Ser radio: "We have not seen fires like this in the last 20 years. These big fires show signs of climate change and strong heatwaves."</p>
            <p>She said that thick smoke made it hard for helicopters and planes to put out the fires.</p>
            <p>The Spanish army sent 1,900 soldiers to help fight the fires.</p>
            <p>One firefighter died when his fire truck crashed on a forest road near Espinoso de Compludo village. Now, a total of four firefighters have died.</p>
            <p>Spain's Interior Minister said that since June, 92 people have been investigated for possibly starting fires on purpose. 27 people have been arrested.</p>
            <p>Southern Europe is having one of its worst wildfire seasons in 20 years. Spain is one of the countries most affected.</p>
            <p>The Institute for Nature and Forest Conservation (ICNF) said that so far this year, wildfires have burned 155,000 hectares of land in Portugal. This is three times the average for the same period from 2006 to 2024. About half of this land burned in the last three days.</p>
            <p>Robles said that the situation will likely not get better unless the heatwave, which has temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius, cools down tonight or tomorrow.</p>
            <p>This heatwave is the third hottest since Spain's national weather agency started tracking temperatures in 1975. Most parts of the country are on alert for wildfires.</p>

            <h1>Chiang Wan-an: If President Chooses Tong Tzu-hsien for Cabinet, It Can Start New Talks</h1>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an, the mayor of Taipei, said today that he invited Pegatron chairman Tong Tzu-hsien to speak last year. After seeing the recent meetings about whether the Third Nuclear Power Plant should continue to operate, he truly believes President Lai Ching-te should ask Tong Tzu-hsien to form the cabinet. If the president agrees to this, it would be a new start for talks in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an wrote on Facebook that last year, when Tong Tzu-hsien was asked to speak at a city meeting about "Industry Development and World Situations," he predicted the tough challenges Taiwan's industries would face. At that time, Chiang told his co-workers, "We should ask someone like him to form the cabinet."</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an said that after watching the recent public meetings about whether the Third Nuclear Power Plant should continue operating, he truly feels that President Lai should ask Mr. Tong Tzu-hsien to form the cabinet.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an also asked everyone to go out and vote. He said to vote for Taiwan's energy plans and to vote "yes" for extending the life of the Third Nuclear Power Plant. This vote, he said, is actually a vote of no confidence in the Democratic Progressive Party and the president.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an stated that trust between political parties has been broken many times since the big recall vote. He believes that if the president is willing to ask Tong Tzu-hsien to form the cabinet, it will be the start of new talks in Taiwanese society.</p>
