            <h1>Hangzhou Tap Water Smells Bad, People Think It's Sewage, But City Says It's Algae</h1>
            <p>Hangzhou, China (CNA) â€“ Tap water in the Yuhang area of Hangzhou, China, smelled very bad. People thought it was caused by sewage mixing with the water, which made many people upset. Today, the city of Hangzhou shared a report about their investigation. They said the bad smell came from many things like the weather, the environment, and how water moves, including algae breaking down in the water. The report said only the smell was unusual, and they did not find any dangerous bacteria like E. coli. Seven government leaders were punished because of this problem.</p>
            <p>CCTV News reported that a group in Hangzhou, called the "Hangzhou Joint Investigation Team," released a report today. It was about the strange water supply in some areas of Yuhang District, Hangzhou. The report said that after the problem started on July 16th, the city of Hangzhou created this team. It included different city groups and experts from China's central and provincial levels. Some groups from the Zhejiang Province government also helped.</p>
            <p>The report stated that tests showed a substance called sulfur compounds in the water samples. This substance is an organic chemical. Even a small amount in water can make it smell like garlic, swamps, or rotten things. Since early July, Hangzhou has been very hot. This caused algae to grow quickly in the water near the Renhe water plant's intake area and nearby. After it rained, some of these algae and the sulfur compounds they made gathered near the water intake. In the early morning of July 16th, they flowed into the water intake, causing the bad smell.</p>
            <p>The report strongly stated that after looking at all the information, the unusual smell in the water in Hangzhou's Yuhang District was caused by many things together. These included the weather, the environment, and how the water moves.</p>
            <p>The report also talked about why people saw yellow or cloudy tap water. It said that the water pipes in the affected area were mostly made of iron. After the problem started, the Yuhang Water Production Company and the Yuhang Water Group's water supply and drainage companies did several things. They changed the water source, changed how water was delivered, and flushed the pipes. These actions changed the direction and speed of the water flow. This caused rust to break off the inside of the pipes, making the water yellow or cloudy. This water then went into water tanks or to people's homes.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that in the Yuhang District, two towns and 49 villages or communities were affected. The smaller water pipes and the water tanks for secondary water supply in these areas have now been cleaned.</p>
            <p>The report also stressed that after the investigation, water samples taken at 8:30 AM on July 16th showed that only the "smell and taste" levels were unusual. No harmful bacteria like E. coli were found. After changing the water source, water quality tests at 1:30 PM that day showed everything was back to normal, and the "smell and taste" results were good. By July 17th, the Hangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention collected and tested water, and all samples met China's national standards for safe drinking water.</p>
            <p>The report stated that the Yuhang Water Production Company, the Yuhang Water Group, the Yuhang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, and the Yuhang District Government were slow in reporting, dealing with, and making decisions about the situation. This showed that the local area had problems and was missing things in terms of public drinking water safety and how to handle sudden events.</p>
            <p>The report said that these groups did not watch the water quality changes enough. Their plans for emergencies were not complete, their systems were not strong, their response to the emergency was slow, and they were slow to share information. Some departments involved were "slow to see problems, slow to act, and did not manage things well." A few party members and leaders did not understand the risks, did not work well, and did not care enough about their purpose. This was a very important lesson to learn.</p>
            <p>This report said that the Communist Party of China's Hangzhou City Discipline Inspection Commission and the Hangzhou City Supervision Commission have formed a team to investigate. They are deeply looking into the problems of groups and people who did not do their jobs well or failed in their duties. Based on what they find, seven leaders will be held responsible. For example, the general manager of Yuhang Environmental Technology Company had his party position taken away and was removed from his government job. The other six people received a warning from the party or a strong caution.</p>
            <p>The report ended by saying that the Hangzhou City Party Committee and Government, and the Yuhang District Party Committee and Government, are very sorry for how this event affected people's lives and work. The city and district governments will face the problems directly. They will "learn from the pain, think widely, and check everything thoroughly." They will improve their ability to prevent and handle emergencies. They will also build a strong system to manage the entire water supply, from the source to the tap. This will make sure the city's water facilities are safe and that people's drinking water is protected.</p>
            <p>On the morning of July 16th, people in Yuhang District, Hangzhou, were shocked. The tap water in their homes had a very strong, bad smell, like human waste. They thought sewage from the pipes had mixed with the tap water. Some people even changed a line from an old poem about Hangzhou, using a similar-sounding word that means "stool." However, the Yuhang District government had already stated in a report on July 19th that the bad smell was caused by sulfur compounds made by algae in the water. But most local people did not believe this explanation.</p>

            <h1>Miaoli County Starts "Under-Forest Economy" in Indigenous Areas: Three Log Mushroom Farms Chosen</h1>
            <p>Miaoli County (CNA) â€“ The Miaoli County Government is working to develop a "forest economy" in indigenous areas. They got help from a central government program. They have chosen three places in Tai'an Township and Nanzhuang Township to grow log mushrooms as examples. They hope to bring in more resources and create a great model for growing log mushrooms under the trees in Miaoli County.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli County Government's Indigenous Peoples and Ethnic Group Development Department said today that Tai'an, Nanzhuang, and Shitan townships in the county have many indigenous people. The mountains and forests are very important to their lives. Log mushrooms grow naturally on wood, are good for the environment, and have high nutritional and economic value. Because of the natural forest environment in these indigenous areas, growing log mushrooms under the trees has great potential for developing a forest economy.</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Department said that to help indigenous villages become more independent financially and to promote sustainable forestry, they are focusing on log mushrooms this year. They want to create a way of doing business that fits local culture and protects nature. This will help them develop the forest economy. It will also help pass on the culture of forest-based economic life to future generations and encourage young people to return home and build up village businesses.</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Department said that currently, 13 indigenous villages in the county are involved in growing log mushrooms. Eight of these are in Nanzhuang Township and five are in Tai'an Township. This is about 40% of all indigenous villages in Miaoli County. The county government got funding from the Council of Indigenous Peoples for a "Log Mushroom Industry Support Program for Indigenous Villages." With this, they chose three excellent places in Tai'an and Nanzhuang townships to be example farms for log mushrooms.</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Department said that the three chosen "log mushroom experts" are Dou Kailin from Baguali village in Nanzhuang Township, Xie Guozhong from Rongan village in Tai'an Township, and Zhang Wenxiong from Da'an village in Tai'an Township. All of them have been growing log mushrooms for a long time and have a lot of experience. Through the industry support program, they will get help to make their mushroom farms better, improve their growing methods, and control the environment. They will also use a "sixth-industry" business model, which combines production with other activities. This will make these example farms places for learning, cultural experiences, and selling products. The goal is to create a model for growing log mushrooms under trees across the whole county.</p>

            <h1>Keelung, Taipei, New Taipei, and Taoyuan Work Together to Attract Tourists from Singapore and Malaysia</h1>
            <p>New Taipei (CNA) â€“ New Taipei City will join with Keelung City, Taipei City, and Taoyuan City. On July 29th, they will go to Singapore to hold a meeting to promote tourism. They hope to attract more tourists from Singapore and Malaysia to visit Taiwan. They want these visitors to enjoy the beautiful mountains, waters, and friendly people in Northern Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The four cities â€“ Keelung, Taipei, New Taipei, and Taoyuan â€“ will hold a tourism promotion event in Singapore from July 29th to August 1st. Today, they held a press conference before their trip. They showed gifts that represent Northern Taiwan, which they plan to give to local businesses at the event. These gifts include Pingtung tea snacks and tea-flavored popcorn. These gifts show the local culture and new ideas well.</p>
            <p>At the press conference, Singaporean artist Wong Jing Lun was invited to speak. He shared what he thinks are the best places to visit in Northern Taiwan. He especially suggested visiting Taiwan to see its beautiful mountains and water, because Singapore's highest mountain is only about a hundred meters tall. He also said he loved how friendly Taiwanese people are. During the press conference, they also played a short video about traveling in Northern Taiwan, made by Miki Yong Xuan, a popular online influencer from Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
            <p>To appeal to the Singaporean and Malaysian markets, the campaign uses "Shiok you around" as the slogan for Northern Taiwan tourism. Yang Tsung-min, the head of the New Taipei City Government Tourism and Travel Department, explained that "Shiok" is a word from Singaporean English (Singlish). It means "satisfied," "great," or "delicious." They hope to offer the most enjoyable travel experiences in the four cities of Northern Taiwan to tourists from Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
            <p>He also said that during the promotion event in Singapore, the four cities will sign agreements (MOUs) with the National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (NATAS) and the Malaysian Chinese Tourism Association (MCTA). In the future, they will work together on making new travel products, bringing in group tourists, and promoting tourism through media. This will create a strong base for long-term cooperation and help more people in Singapore and Malaysia know about Northern Taiwan as a travel destination.</p>
