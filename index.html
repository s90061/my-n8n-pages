            <h1>Macron Says 26 Countries Will Give Security Help to Ukraine After War; Italy Won't Send Soldiers</h1>
            <p>After a meeting with Ukraine's friends today, French President Emmanuel Macron said that 26 countries have promised to give Ukraine security help after the war. This help will include creating a combined army, navy, and air force from different countries. Italy, however, repeated that it will not send soldiers to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Macron also said he talked with US President Donald Trump after the meeting with many European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The US help for security is expected to be finalized in the next few days.</p>
            <p>The meeting today brought together leaders from 35 countries in the "Coalition of the Willing." The goal of the meeting was to finish plans for Ukraine's security help and to get support from Trump. European countries clearly stated that Trump's agreement is very important for this security help to work.</p>
            <p>Macron said at a press conference at the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace in France: "When the conflict ends, the security help will begin."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy, who was next to Macron, said: "We understand what is needed for real security help. A basic plan is already in place."</p>
            <p>Macron first said that these 26 countries would send their forces inside Ukraine. But later he said that some countries would provide help from outside Ukraine. For example, they would help train and give equipment to Ukrainian forces.</p>
            <p>Macron did not say how many soldiers would be part of the security help.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that 26 countries want to join. They are now preparing documents with each country to explain what their promises mean. He was not ready to announce how many soldiers might take part in patrols on land, at sea, or in the air.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Italian Prime Minister's office said Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke to her allies online today. She repeated that Italy will not send soldiers to Ukraine. However, if a peace agreement is made, Italy can help watch over it.</p>
            <p>Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has not ended yet. This security help aims to make Ukraine feel safe and stop Russia from attacking Ukraine again after the war. European officials admitted that peace seems far away now. But they hope to be ready once the war finishes.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Fall by About 1% as US Oil Stores Grow and OPEC+ May Produce More</h1>
            <p>International oil prices fell by about 1% today, reaching their lowest point in two weeks. This happened because the US had an unexpected increase in oil stored last week. Also, people expect that OPEC+ (a group of oil-producing countries and their friends) will agree to produce more oil at their meeting this weekend.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures dropped by 65 cents, or 1.0%, to close at $66.95 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil dropped by 49 cents, or 0.8%, to close at $63.48 per barrel.</p>
