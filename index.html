            <h1>Russian Foreign Minister: No Attack on Europe Planned, but Will Respond Strongly to Aggression</h1>
            <p>Sergey Lavrov, Russia's Foreign Minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly today. He told world leaders that Russia does not plan to attack Europe. However, he warned that Russia would respond strongly to any attack against it.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that in recent weeks, planes without permission have entered the airspace of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). People think Russia is responsible for these events, which has made Europe very worried. The situation became more serious after NATO planes shot down a drone over Poland. Also, Estonia said Russian fighter jets flew into its country and stayed for 12 minutes.</p>
            <p>Russia said its planes did not enter Estonia. It also said the drones were not aimed at Poland. Belarus, a friend of Russia, said that Ukraine's signal jamming made the drones go off course. But leaders in Europe believe these events were purposeful actions to make NATO unstable and to see how NATO would react.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Lavrov insisted that Russia is the one facing threats.</p>
            <p>He said, "Russia has never intended to attack European or NATO countries, and it still doesn't. But, any attack against our country will get a strong response."</p>
            <p>This week, US President Donald Trump said he thinks Ukraine can take back all the land Russia has taken.</p>
            <p>This is a big change in what the US leader usually says. Before, he said Ukraine needed to give up some things. He also said Ukraine could never get back all the areas Russia took since it seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a full invasion in 2022.</p>
            <p>Three weeks ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia and the US understood each other. He also said that Trump's government was "listening to us."</p>
            <p>Mr. Trump shared his new idea after meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the 23rd, during the UN General Assembly.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Questions Drone Crossing from Hungary; Hungary Replies with Sarcasm</h1>
            <p>Kyiv, September 27. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently spoke about a first military report. He questioned whether a spy drone crossed the border from Hungary. He thought it might be trying to find out about Ukraine's factories in the west. Yesterday, the government in Budapest responded with a sarcastic remark.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zelenskyy mentioned this early military report but did not say exactly when it happened. After talking with Ukraine's top military leaders, he posted on Telegram. He wrote, "I have ordered to check all the information we have. I also asked for immediate reports on every event that is recorded."</p>
            <p>Later, in his regular speech, Mr. Zelenskyy also talked about "very strange events" happening near the border with Hungary. He said he had ordered a "full investigation." He warned that if similar drones appear again, Ukraine would "take suitable actions to protect our country."</p>
            <p>Hungary's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, posted on X, a social media platform. He said, "President Zelenskyy has lost his mind because of his feelings against Hungary. Now he is starting to see things that are not there."</p>
            <p>Ukraine's military general staff also shared pictures online that looked like a drone invasion. They said that Ukrainian drones were already flying in that area to check it.</p>
            <p>Hungary is a member of the European Union and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). These two groups support Kyiv in the war between Russia and Ukraine. But the relationship between Ukraine and Hungary has always been difficult. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has always questioned Western military help for Ukraine. He also has a friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

            <p>Reuters tried to call the Tamil Nadu Health Department and the office of the state leader, M.K. Stalin. No one answered the calls.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stalin posted on X, saying, "The news from Karur is worrying." He also added that he has told ministers and officials to give urgent medical help to those who were hurt at the Karur rally. He also ordered more help from nearby Tiruchirappalli.</p>
