            <h1>Heavy Rain in Pingtung Mountains: 78 People Evacuated, Highway 24 Closed</h1>
            <p>(Pingtung County, July 29, Central News Agency reporter Li Huiting) Due to a typhoon's outer winds and a southwest air current, the weather is unstable. In the mountains of Pingtung, 78 people have been moved to safety. Also, the Ministry of Transportation's Highway Bureau closed part of Provincial Highway 24 at 6 PM tonight. This is because falling rocks are common in the mountains.</p>
            <p>Weather data shows that from midnight today until about 8 PM tonight, 16 of the top 20 places with the most rain in Taiwan were in Pingtung. Most of these places are in the Hengchun Peninsula and Little Liuqiu area. One weather station in Dapingding, Hengchun Township, recorded 271 millimeters of rain. This was the highest amount in all of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Because of the heavy rain, by 7 PM tonight, the Pingtung County Government had moved a total of 78 people from Sandimen Township and Manzhou Township. 24 of these people are staying with family, and 54 are in shelters. The county government also announced that 8 local townshipsâ€”Wutai, Sandimen, Majia, Laiyi, Taiwu, Chunri, Shizi, and Mudanâ€”will not have work or school on July 30. This is because the amount of rain has reached a certain level.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau said today in a press release that, according to the weather agency, the total rainfall in the Pingtung mountain area is expected to reach 700 to 900 millimeters. Since it has been raining a lot, the soil is very wet and loose. There have also been reports of falling rocks. Also, it is hard to see at night. So, at 6 PM, they closed Provincial Highway 24 from kilometer 27.4 to 37.3, which is from Dewen entrance to Shenshan. They will open it again after checking the weather and road safety.

            <h1>Financial Companies Donate to Help After Typhoon and Heavy Rains in Central and Southern Taiwan</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 29, Central News Agency reporters Su Siyun, Chang Ai) Recently, a typhoon and southwest air currents have caused many days of heavy rain. This has led to serious floods and damaged homes in central and southern Taiwan. Many financial companies have decided to donate money. Today, Cathay Financial Holding announced a donation of NT$20 million. Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding also donated NT$10 million, and E.SUN Financial Holding donated NT$6 million. They hope to help people affected by the disaster rebuild their homes.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holding announced today that it will donate NT$20 million to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's special disaster relief fund. They hope this money will help affected people rebuild their homes and return to normal life soon. Cathay Life Insurance and Cathay Century Insurance, which are part of Cathay Financial Holding, quickly started their support services when the typhoon hit.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holding said that Cathay Life Insurance's customer service includes fast claim payments, advance payments for medical claims, delaying premium payments, delaying interest on policy loans, delaying payments for home loans, and free reissuing of insurance policies. People can apply for these services from now until September 30. For homeowners whose houses were damaged by the typhoon, Cathay Century Insurance quickly started fast claim services. They also offer a "quick claim" service for guava farmers.</p>
            <p>Taishin Bank, which is part of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding, helps people rebuild after disasters. For existing loan customers who cannot pay back their loans because of natural disasters or other serious problems, the bank will consider each case. They may allow customers to delay paying back the main amount of the loan, or both the main amount and interest, or extend the loan period. This helps reduce the pressure on people affected by the disaster.</p>
            <p>Shin Kong Life Insurance, also part of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding, offers help to policyholders in affected areas. This includes active help with claims, free reissuing of policies, discounts for delaying premium payments, discounts for delaying interest on policy loans, and flexible main payment terms for home loans. Policyholders can go to any customer service center or ask their service agent for these services.</p>
            <p>E.SUN Financial Holding also announced recently that its companies, E.SUN Bank and E.SUN Securities, will together donate NT$6 million to the "Typhoon Danas Disaster Relief Fund" account. This account is set up by the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Public Charitable Foundation. The money will help with disaster aid and urgent medical care after the typhoon.</p>
            <p>E.SUN Bank has also started several financial aid measures for people affected by the disaster to help them rebuild their homes safely. For home loans, people affected by the disaster can ask for a lower interest rate for one year, or they can get up to a 3-year grace period. This will make it easier to pay back the loan. For personal loans, they offer up to a six-month grace period, which allows more flexibility with money.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank said it is fully helping Tainan City recover after the disaster. They are working with the Tainan City Government's "Typhoon Danas Home Recovery Assistance Fund Program" to quickly send money to people affected by the disaster. From now on, all transaction fees will be free. They hope this helps affected people rebuild their homes quickly and get through this difficult time. (Editor: Yang Kaixiang)</p>
