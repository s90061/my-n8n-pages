            <h1>Israeli Air Attack Near Damascus After Syria's Regime Change</h1>
            <p>Syrian state media reported today that Israeli forces carried out an air attack near Damascus last night. This happened after Israeli forces had bombed the area several times.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Israel did not confirm the attack. However, Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, said that Israeli forces are working "in all war zones" to keep their country safe.</p>
            <p>If this attack is confirmed, it would be the deepest air attack by Israel into Syria since a group of Islamists took control in Damascus last December.</p>
            <p>The Syrian Foreign Ministry said that Israeli warplanes attacked a place near Kisweh, a suburb of Damascus, on August 26. Six Syrian soldiers died in that attack. State TV also reported that Israeli warplanes bombed the area again last night.</p>
            <p>After the second attack yesterday, the Syrian news agency (SANA) reported that Israel dropped troops by air to carry out the attack.</p>
            <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that this place holds weapons used by Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a group from Lebanon that gets help from Iran. It was a main supporter of the former Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, who was removed from power.</p>
            <p>Also, Israel and the Houthi rebels in Yemen both said that Israeli forces attacked Sanaa today. Sanaa is the capital of Yemen and is controlled by the Houthi rebels. This attack came four days after the Israeli military bombed the Houthi rebels, causing many deaths.</p>
            <p>The Houthi rebels said that on August 25, an Israeli air attack on Sanaa killed 10 people and injured more than 90.</p>

            <h1>Sinner Wins in Straight Sets, Moves to US Open Men's Singles Third Round, Aiming for Second Straight Title</h1>
            <p>Jannik Sinner, the tennis star from Italy, won his second-round match at the US Open today. He beat Alexei Popyrin from Australia in three straight sets. Sinner is still playing strongly, just like in his first match, as he aims to win the championship again.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Sinner, who is 24 years old, only lost four games in his first match against Vit Kopriva from the Czech Republic. Kopriva is ranked 89th in the world for men's singles.</p>
            <p>Today, in his second-round match, Sinner broke Popyrin's serve five times. Popyrin is ranked 36th in the world. Sinner won the match in just 2 hours and 1 minute with scores of 6-3, 6-2, and 6-2, sending his opponent home.</p>
            <p>In the third round, Sinner will play against Denis Shapovalov, a good player from Canada. Shapovalov is the 27th seed in this tournament.</p>
            <p>After the match, Sinner said, "I always try to play my best. The first round is always different from later matches in the tournament."</p>
            <p>He added, "I am happy that I played well. When you win two sets and break serve again, you just try to serve well."</p>
            <p>"Today, both my opponent and I didn't serve perfectly. But my return game was good, especially on the second serve. I am happy today. I hope to serve better in the next matches. For other parts of my game, I feel very confident."</p>
            <p>Before this US Open, Sinner reached the finals in all three Grand Slam tournaments this season. He won the Australian Open and Wimbledon. However, he lost to Carlos Alcaraz from Spain in the French Open final, finishing second.</p>
            <p>Sinner is now trying to be the next male player to win the US Open two times in a row. Roger Federer, a famous tennis player from Switzerland, won the US Open five times in a row from 2004 to 2008.</p>

            <h1>Naomi Osaka Moves to US Open Third Round, Swiatek Wins Tough Three-Set Match</h1>
            <p>The results for the women's singles second round at the US Open are coming in. Iga Swiatek, the number 2 player from Poland, had a difficult three-set match but won and moved on. Naomi Osaka, a famous player from Japan, won her match easily in two sets.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Reuters, Swiatek played against Suzan Lamens from the Netherlands today at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Swiatek won with scores of 6-1, 4-6, and 6-4. In the next round, she will play Anna Kalinskaya from Russia, who is the 29th seed in the tournament.</p>
            <p>Swiatek won the US Open in 2022. Earlier this year, she won her sixth major championship at Wimbledon. Many people think she is likely to win this year's tournament too.</p>
            <p>After her match, she said, "I think the game mostly depends on if I make mistakes... I might have been a bit nervous in the second set, and my opponent really used that chance."</p>
            <p>Also, Naomi Osaka, who has won the US Open women's singles title twice, had an easy win today. She beat Hailey Baptiste from the US, who is ranked 47th in the world, with scores of 6-3 and 6-1. The match lasted only 70 minutes.</p>
            <p>Osaka is the 23rd seed in this tournament and has won the US Open women's singles title two times. By moving to the third round today, she has matched her best performance in a Grand Slam tournament since she won the Australian Open in 2021. That was her fourth major championship.</p>
            <p>In her next match, she will play against the winner of the match between Daria Kasatkina, the 15th seed from Australia, and Kamilla Rakhimova from Russia.</p>
