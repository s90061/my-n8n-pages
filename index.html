            <h1>Zhao Shao-kang Wants to Stop Outside Forces from Affecting Political Parties; MAC Supports This</h1>
            <p>Zhao Shao-kang, who used to be the chairman of Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC), suggests changing the law. He wants to stop outside forces from affecting party elections. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said they are happy about Zhao's idea. They believe it would be a big problem if major political parties' elections were influenced by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
            <p>On October 16, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) held a regular press conference. Liang Wen-jie, the Vice Chairman and spokesman, led the meeting.</p>
            <p>Zhao Shao-kang recently said that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was involved in the Kuomintang (KMT) chairman election. He wants to change the law so that outside forces cannot affect party internal elections.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-jie said that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the real threat from outside forces to Taiwan. Before, Taiwan had the Anti-Infiltration Act, which stopped outside forces from affecting official elections. Zhao Shao-kang wants to make this law stronger to include internal party elections. Liang Wen-jie thinks this is "very necessary."</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-jie also said that if Taiwan's main political parties were secretly influenced, or if their leaders' elections were affected by the Chinese Communist Party, it would be a very big problem. He added that if the CCP chose a party leader, the situation would be even worse. "So, we welcome Mr. Zhao Shao-kang's suggestion," he said.</p>

            <h1>China Offers Rewards for 18 People in Taiwan's Psychological Warfare Team; MAC Says it Scares Taiwanese People</h1>
            <p>Chinese public security said they are offering rewards for information about 18 people from Taiwan's psychological warfare team. China's Taiwan Affairs Office supported this, calling it a "just act." Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded, saying that China is trying to scare Taiwanese people by making false arrests and lawsuits. They want to make it seem like they have control over Taiwan from far away.</p>
            <p>On October 16, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) held its regular press conference. Liang Wen-jie, the Vice Chairman and spokesman, led the meeting.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-jie explained that China's reward announcements threaten people with death sentences and lifetime punishment. He said these actions continue a series of moves started last year with the "Punishing Independence 22 Articles." The goal is to make it seem like China has long-arm control and to scare Taiwanese citizens with false arrests and lawsuits.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-jie stressed that if any Taiwanese person helps China by giving information for these rewards, they might break Taiwan's National Security Act, National Intelligence Work Act, or Criminal Code, depending on what they do. He asked people not to help China for small personal gains.</p>
            <p>Chen Binhua, the spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press conference yesterday that the public security authorities issued reward announcements for 18 key members of Taiwan's psychological warfare team. He called this a specific action to put the "Punishing Independence 22 Articles" into practice. He also said it was a fair action to protect the shared interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the main interests of the Chinese nation.</p>

            <h1>"The House of Wu Dan: Yang Lian-ying" Published with Over 200 Historical Images</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs announced the release of "The House of Wu Dan: Yang Lian-ying." This book includes more than 200 historical pictures and many interviews. Yang Lian-ying, a Peking opera "Wu Dan" (female martial arts role), received the Chinese Literary and Art Medal twice. She is also important for continuing the Jingchao school of "Wu Dan" art in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Department of Cultural Affairs held a book launch event. This book is the 21st in the "Traditional Arts Series," which started in 2008. These books help to study, protect, and keep Taipei's intangible cultural heritage alive.</p>
            <p>The Department of Cultural Affairs said that "The House of Wu Dan: Yang Lian-ying" focuses on Yang Lian-ying's life and art. It combines her story with the theater history knowledge of scholar Xu Ya-xiang. The book talks about Yang Lian-ying's everyday life and special moments as a "Wu Dan." The book covers her family background, her training at Xiao Dapeng, the teachers and skills she learned, her performances, how opera groups worked, traditions in the opera world, teaching, and her thoughts on the theater scene.</p>
            <p>Chen Yu-hsin, the Deputy Director of the Department of Cultural Affairs, said that Yang Lian-ying joined Xiao Dapeng to learn opera when she was 8 years old. She went through strict training. For 30 years, she focused on performing on stage. For the next 30 years, she worked on teaching and promoting opera. Besides Peking opera, she also worked with Taiwanese opera, Hakka opera, and dance, showing her ability to combine different art forms.</p>
            <p>Lin Da-wei, the Dean of Academic Affairs at National Taipei University of the Arts, said that the university invited Yang Lian-ying to teach starting in 2018, and many students have learned a lot from her.</p>
            <p>Xu Ya-xiang mentioned that it took two years to do research and write the book. Through Yang Lian-ying's perspective as a "Wu Dan," readers can see a part of Taiwan's opera history and its spirit.</p>
            <p>The Department of Cultural Affairs said that readers can buy the book at places like the National Bookstore, Wunan Online Bookstore, Books.com.tw, or Eslite Online Bookstore. The department has also made all books in the series available online for free reading on several e-book platforms.</p>
