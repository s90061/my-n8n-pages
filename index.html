<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%96%B0ai%E8%B6%85%E7%B4%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%85%A6nano5-%E4%BB%81%E5%AF%B6%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%88%E5%85%89%E7%AD%89%E5%8F%B0%E5%BB%A0%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E7%AE%97%E5%8A%9B-073107510.html">News Link</a>

Taipei, June 24 (CNA) â€“ The National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs) National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC), which is part of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), held a press conference today. They showed the achievements of Nano 5, the new national AI supercomputer. This supercomputer provides powerful computing resources that help the semiconductor industry innovate and improve. Companies and academic institutions like Compal Electronics, ASE Technology Holding, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, and National Cheng Kung University also shared their experiences.

Jingchuang 25 (Nano 5) is a new type of supercomputer with accelerator clusters. It is a key part of Taiwan's growth in AI and high-performance computing. It uses NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which greatly improve the speed of calculations for AI model training and scientific simulations.

To strengthen both chip and AI development, and to show the many research and development applications of the Jingchuang mainframe Nano 5 in boosting semiconductor technology innovation and industrial upgrades, the "New Generation National AI Supercomputer - Jingchuang Mainframe Nano 5 Driving Semiconductor Industry Innovation and Upgrade Achievement Presentation" was held today. It took place at the Shalun NSTC Information Security and Smart Technology R&D Building in Tainan, guided by the NSTC and hosted by the NARLabs NCHC.

The NARLabs NCHC stated in a press release that this presentation highlighted important results from the "Jingchuang Mainframe Nano 5 Call for Proposals Project." It clearly showed how the new supercomputer built by the NCHC, with its powerful computing technology, effectively helps Taiwan's semiconductor industry to innovate and upgrade. This provides strong momentum for the "Jingchuang Taiwan Program."

NSTC Minister Wu Tsung-tsong said in his speech that to face new challenges in global technological competition, the government continues to invest in building top-tier R&D infrastructure. The NSTC will also keep promoting technology policies that use chips as a base and AI as an accelerator. The goal is to make Taiwan an innovative island built on chips and AI, showing "Team Taiwan's" important strength on the global technology stage.

NARLabs President Tsai Hung-ying noted that the high-performance computing resources of the Jingchuang mainframe Nano 5 are speeding up chip design and process innovation through AI and high-performance computing. This creates a positive cycle of technology R&D and computing power use. NARLabs will continue to create an open and shared innovation platform, improve cooperation among industry, academia, and research institutions, and promote upgrades in the semiconductor industry, giving a strong boost to Taiwan's technological innovation.

Zhang Chao-liang, Director of the NARLabs NCHC, said that launching the Jingchuang mainframe Nano 5 is the first step in strengthening R&D infrastructure under the "Jingchuang Taiwan Program." The NCHC will continue to expand its high-performance computing mainframe over the next four years. Through the call for proposals for semiconductor industry innovation and upgrading, today's 15 groups of achievements cover design, manufacturing, packaging, and testing. They show overall improvements in R&D efficiency, design quality, and energy efficiency, further boosting innovation in the southern semiconductor hub.

In addition, the NARLabs NCHC announced that the achievement presentation invited Synopsys, Hon Hai Research Institute Semiconductor Research Center, and TrustMe Technology to give special talks. These talks focused on three main topics: chip design, manufacturing innovation, and system security.

The NARLabs NCHC pointed out that 15 industry, academic, and research organizations participated today by sharing their achievements and setting up exhibition booths. These included Compal Electronics (working with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University), ASE Technology Holding, Taian Technology (working with National Cheng Kung University), Anko International (working with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University), Brewer, G-Men Smart, King Mega Wealth (working with UnieAI), Abit Electronics, Zhengsheng Semiconductor, Smart Link Services (working with UnieAI), National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, RadSense, Phison Electronics, and GenTech Technology.

The NARLabs NCHC stated that the areas covered included optimizing circuit design, low-power chips, edge security AI chips, terminal inference chips, semiconductor mask optimization, and using generative AI in semiconductor fields. These examples show the successful R&D results achieved by effectively using the NCHC's high-performance computing resources.

Toronto, June 23 (CNA) - Canada's largest LGBTQ+ event, the Toronto Pride Parade, will be held on June 29. The non-profit organization "Taiwan With Pride Association" in Toronto will participate in the parade for the third time this year to speak up for Taiwan.

The "Taiwan With Pride Association" aims to use this event to showcase Taiwan's diversity and tolerance to the international community. They believe that Taiwan's participation in the parade reflects its values of freedom, democracy, and human rights.

This year, the "Taiwan With Pride" float will feature a DJ performance. Taiwan's representative to Canada will also be attending the event, emphasizing Taiwan's commitment to supporting LGBTQ+ rights and its unique position as a beacon of democracy in Asia.

The parade is also supported by many multinational companies, including Google, Nissan, Home Depot, and Clorox. More than 200 LGBTQ+ organizations will participate, creating a diverse and inclusive atmosphere.

The "Taiwan With Pride" association hopes that by participating in such international events, they can raise Taiwan's international visibility and foster a greater understanding of Taiwan's democratic achievements and social progress.

**SEMICON Taiwan Upgrades to "International Semiconductor Week"**

<a href="https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/semicon-taiwan-%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8E%E9%AB%94%E5%91%A8-201000087.html">News Link</a>

Taipei (CNA) - SEMICON Taiwan 2025, a major annual event for the global semiconductor industry, officially launched on June 17. Celebrating its 30th anniversary, SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) announced that the exhibition will be upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week." This move comes amid the U.S.-China tech war, where former U.S. President Trump's high tariffs have pressured allied companies to return their manufacturing to their home countries. Major manufacturers like TSMC are facing increasing pressure to invest in the U.S.

In the future, semiconductor companies will be forced to "choose sides," and supply chains will accelerate regional restructuring. Semiconductors have transitioned from commercial goods to strategic assets, shifting decision-making from "market efficiency" to "national security resilience."

SEMICON Taiwan 2025 will run from September 8 to 12. SEMI estimates that the overall scale of the exhibition will grow by over 20% compared to last year, with visitor numbers expected to reach a new historical high. This year's event will feature various forums and exhibitions focusing on topics like advanced manufacturing, heterogeneous integration, sustainable manufacturing, and smart manufacturing.

The upgrading of SEMICON Taiwan to an "International Semiconductor Week" highlights Taiwan's crucial role in the global semiconductor industry. It also reflects the increasing importance of collaboration and innovation in addressing current geopolitical and technological challenges. The event will bring together over a thousand global industry leaders, showcasing the latest technologies and fostering partnerships to drive future growth and resilience in the semiconductor ecosystem.
