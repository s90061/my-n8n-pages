            <h1>Heavy Rains in Mexico Cause Floods, At Least 44 People Die</h1>
            <p>The government of Mexico announced today that many days of heavy rain have caused floods and killed at least 44 people.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that tropical storms Priscilla and Raymond brought strong rains. These rains caused landslides and floods in five states.</p>
            <p>A government statement said that 18 people died in Veracruz state, 16 in Hidalgo, 9 in Puebla, and 1 in Queretaro.</p>
            <p>President Claudia Sheinbaum's government has started a plan to help 139 towns affected by the disaster.</p>
            <p>Photos from the Mexican army showed soldiers using inflatable boats to rescue people. Some houses were covered in mud and water. Rescue workers walked with difficulty in waist-deep water on the streets.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum said on X, a social media platform: "We are still watching the serious situation in Veracruz, Hidalgo, Puebla, Queretaro, and San Luis Potosi states. We are working together with the governors and federal groups."</p>

            <h1>Rare Earth Problem: Vance Says Trump Has Many Ways to Act, Hopes China Will Be Fair</h1>
            <p>Today, U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance spoke on Fox News Channel. He said that China's limits on rare earth minerals are shocking. He added that the U.S. cannot fix its lack of these important resources in just eight months. This problem needs talks. Also, some important businesses will move back to the U.S. Vance hopes China will act fairly. President Donald Trump is open to different ways of responding.</p>
            <p>On Fox News Channel's Sunday show, Vance spoke about China's government limiting rare earth exports. He said that President Trump is thankful for his friendship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Their relationship is good. But the Chinese government's actions with rare earth minerals are surprising.</p>
            <p>Vance said that China has stopped trade of rare resources that many countries need. This is not just against the U.S. but a threat to the whole world. The U.S. has many ways to respond, and he and Trump do not want to use them. The U.S. wants to build its rare earth industry again. It also wants to have a good relationship with China, not stop all Chinese goods from coming in.</p>
            <p>The host, Maria Battiromo, asked why the U.S. depends on China for resources. She also asked if Vance supports removing Chinese companies linked to the military from U.S. stock markets as a way to respond.</p>
            <p>Vance pointed out that Trump's earlier decision to declare an emergency and put tariffs (extra taxes on goods) is very important. China controls most of the important resources the U.S. needs. This fits the definition of an emergency. Trump has made key decisions in the last eight months to solve this problem. If the U.S. does not raise tariffs, it will be hard to talk with China and make sure the U.S. economy gets the resources it needs.</p>
            <p>He said Trump is open to all ways of responding. He will decide what is best for the U.S. But why did this situation happen? The answer is that leaders from both political parties have allowed important industries, like rare earth magnets and computer chips, to move production overseas for a long time. The U.S. invented computer chips, but Taiwan, near China, makes almost all the chips the world's economy needs.</p>
            <p>Vance said this is because leaders failed, and it is a national emergency. Trump will work hard to fix this problem. It will not be solved in eight months. It needs talks, and some key supply industries must move back to the U.S. Trump promises to protect the U.S. economy and make it able to support itself. Both of these things must happen at the same time.</p>
            <p>About U.S.-China talks, he said it is like a complex dance. Most of it depends on how China responds. If China is unfriendly, he believes Trump has many more advantages than China. If China acts in an understandable way, Trump will be a fair negotiator.</p>
            <p>Vance said many things will happen in the next few weeks. Will China start a trade war or act reasonably? He hopes they will act reasonably, but no matter what, Trump will protect the U.S.</p>

            <h1>Ceasefire Stays Before Peace Meeting; Israel Thinks All Hostages Will Be Free Soon</h1>
            <p>Today, the Israeli government said that all remaining hostages held in the Gaza Strip are expected to be set free tomorrow. Meanwhile, Palestinians are waiting for Israel to release hundreds of prisoners. Also, a lot of aid is expected to arrive in Gaza, where people are very hungry.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Eyal Zamir, the head of Israel's army, said in a statement: "In a few hours, we will all be together again."</p>
            <p>U.S. President Trump plans to travel to Israel and Egypt later today. He will praise the ceasefire agreement announced last week. This agreement gives hope that the two-year war will end.</p>
            <p>Shosh Bedrosian, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, said: "We expect all 20 hostages who are still alive to be given to the Red Cross at the same time. They will be taken in 6 to 8 cars." She also said that Israel does not expect the armed groups to do this openly, like in past exchanges of prisoners.</p>
            <p>Bedrosian said the hostages will go to a military base to meet their families. If they need medical help, they will go straight to a hospital.</p>
            <p>After all hostages are free, Israel is ready to release about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel will also get the bodies of 28 hostages who are believed to be dead. Bedrosian said the army plans to hold memorial services for them in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Gal Hirsch, Israel's coordinator for hostages and missing persons, said an international team will look for the bodies of dead hostages who are not returned within 72 hours. Officials said some hostage bodies might be under rubble, and finding them could take time.</p>
            <p>The exact time for the release of Palestinian prisoners has not been announced yet. These prisoners include 250 people sentenced to life in prison. It also includes 1,700 people arrested in Gaza during the war who have not been charged.</p>
            <p>At the Gaza border, preparations are being made to allow much more aid to enter. The Israeli army unit in charge of humanitarian aid for Gaza said that, according to the agreement, about 600 trucks are expected to pass through each day.</p>
            <p>Egypt said it will send 400 aid trucks into Gaza today. Pictures from the Associated Press show that dozens of trucks have already passed through the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. The Egyptian Red Crescent said these trucks carry medical supplies, tents, blankets, food, and fuel. They will first go to the Kerem Shalom crossing for inspection by the Israeli army.</p>
            <p>According to the White House schedule, President Trump, who worked hard to make the ceasefire happen, is expected to arrive in Israel tomorrow morning. He will meet with the families of the hostages and give a speech in the Israeli Parliament (Knesset).</p>
            <p>After that, Trump will go to Egypt. According to the office of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Trump will lead tomorrow's "Peace Summit" with other leaders from the region and around the world.</p>
