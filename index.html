            <h1>Hu Youping, a school escort from Suzhou Japanese School, chosen as China's 'Hero for Righteous Deeds'</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 21) The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China held the 15th "National Heroes for Righteous Deeds Commendation Conference" in Beijing today. Hu Youping, a female escort who bravely protected students in a car during an attack at Suzhou Japanese School in June 2024 and was stabbed to death, received the title "National Hero for Righteous Deeds." Seven other people and two groups also received this honor.</p>
            <p>According to reports from Xinhua News Agency and a notice from the "Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission Chang'an Jian" WeChat public account, Hu Youping was noted as "a resident of Gusu District, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, before her sacrifice." However, the notice did not provide details of her specific brave actions.</p>
            <p>The announcement stated that at this conference, eight individuals, including Hu Youping, and two groups were named "National Heroes for Righteous Deeds." Also, 40 individuals and 10 groups received the title "National Model for Righteous Deeds."</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of June 24, 2024, an unemployed man named Zhou Jiasheng from Anhui, living in Suzhou, attacked a Japanese mother and son near Suzhou Japanese School with a knife, injuring them. He then got on the school bus and continued his attack. Hu Youping, the female escort on the bus, bravely stood up to him and was fatally stabbed. This incident shocked both Chinese and Japanese societies. Zhou was arrested soon after. On January 23 this year, a court sentenced him to death, and he was executed in April.</p>
            <p>After Hu Youping's death, Japanese people living in China and some Chinese people expressed their sadness. Some Japanese people wanted to donate money to support her family. However, her family later released a statement saying they would "not accept donations of money or items." They also asked "not to be disturbed anymore, wishing only for the deceased to rest in peace and for the family to return to a peaceful life soon."</p>
            <p>Soon after the incident, the Suzhou "Righteous Deeds Title Evaluation Team" asked the Suzhou government on June 27, 2024, to officially give Hu Youping the title "Suzhou Model for Righteous Deeds." This title was officially given to her on July 2 of the same year.</p>
            <p>Chen Wenqing, Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China, said at the commendation conference that "the cause of righteous deeds has made new achievements" since the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He added that they should continue to improve "work related to righteous deeds," so that righteous deeds become a "new social trend in the new era." He also said they should strongly promote the spirit of righteous deeds, widely spread stories of righteous deeds, "truly care for" heroes of righteous deeds, and strengthen the organization and leadership of work related to righteous deeds, always creating "a new situation for the cause of righteous deeds in the new era."</p>

            <h1>European Parliament Delegation Meets with Jiang Chi-chen, Hopes to Discuss All-Society Defense Strategies</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 21) Jiang Chi-chen, the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, met with an official group from the European Parliament's "Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all Democratic Processes in the European Union, including Disinformation" (EUDS) today. Jiang Chi-chen said that Taiwan and the European Union have a strong trade relationship. He hopes to sign a Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA) with the EU soon.</p>
            <p>Nathalie Loiseau, the head of the visiting group, spoke through a translator. She said that signing a BIA is a good start. The group wants to talk with Taiwan about how it is building overall defense for its society. They also want to understand how Taiwan deals with its relationship with the United States.</p>
            <p>Jiang Chi-chen met with the official group from the European Parliament's "Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all Democratic Processes in the European Union, including Disinformation" (EUDS) at the Legislative Yuan today. Other members of the Legislative Yuan from both ruling and opposition parties were also there.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Jiang Chi-chen thanked the European Parliament and the European Union for supporting Taiwan's involvement in the international community over the years. They have shown this support through resolutions, statements, questions, and public declarations.</p>
            <p>Jiang Chi-chen said that in the past five years, the European Parliament has passed over 40 laws or resolutions that support Taiwan. He thanked them for this. He also said he especially hopes to sign a BIA with the EU soon. This is because the EU is Taiwan's fourth-largest trading partner, and their trade relationship is very close. He believes that clear rules and agreements would greatly help improve trade and investment between both sides.</p>
            <p>Finally, Jiang Chi-chen said he is thankful for the European Parliament's strong and long-term support for Taiwan. He noted, "Even though we are geographically far apart, our values are very similar."</p>
            <p>Nathalie Loiseau also said that the European Parliament highly values making its relationship with Taiwan deeper. She added that signing a BIA is a good way to start, and both sides are working towards this goal.</p>
            <p>Loiseau said that Taiwan faces many challenges from outside forces. She gave the example of Russia, showing how authoritarian systems can use a society's weaknesses. The visiting group understands this and hopes to share ideas with Taiwan about its strategies for overall societal defense.</p>

            <h1>US Payment Company Block Added to S&P 500 Index, a Big Step for Fintech Industry</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, New York, July 21) Block, a US payment company, will join the S&P 500 index. This is a big step for the financial technology (fintech) industry. Block's stock price went up by almost 10% before trading opened today.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that S&P Dow Jones Indices announced on July 18 that Block would join the S&P 500 index, starting before trading opens on July 23. Block is taking the place of Hess Corp., an American oil company that was bought by a larger company, Chevron.</p>
            <p>Block was started by US tech billionaire Jack Dorsey and others. Its current market value is about 44.8 billion US dollars (about 1.32 trillion New Taiwan dollars). It is one of the most valuable and important companies in the financial technology industry. Becoming a part of the S&P 500 index will make its position even stronger.</p>
            <p>Block works at the point where traditional payments and digital money meet. Its digital products include systems for sales (POS), direct transfers between people (P2P), and Bitcoin services.</p>
            <p>Block's inclusion in the S&P 500 shows that digital payments and financial apps are now very common. It also means that old ways of banking in the US are changing. This will make Block more known to large investors and strengthen its power in the American financial industry.</p>
