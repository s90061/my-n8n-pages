            <h1>American Conservative Internet Star Kirk Shot Dead; Suspect Arrested, Family Reveals Motive</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 12 (Central News Agency) - American conservative internet star Charlie Kirk was recently shot and killed. This shocking event has created a lot of discussion across the United States. Today, officials confirmed that the suspect has been caught. They also showed a photo of the suspect's criminal record. The suspect is reportedly a 22-year-old man from Utah named Robinson. His family says he has become "more political" in recent years.</p>
            <p>Kirk, 31, died after being shot in the neck while giving a speech at Utah Valley University in Utah. A video from the event shows him speaking to a crowd. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and he fell into his chair. The camera quickly moved away, and the people listening became very scared.</p>
            <p>Kirk was an important supporter of Donald Trump. He was also a well-known internet personality and a leader in the youth conservative movement. He had millions of followers on social media. People liked him because his videos were smart and well-edited. He was also good at dealing with people who tried to cause problems or disagree with his ideas.</p>
            <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced today in a press conference that authorities have arrested Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Kirk's shooting.</p>
            <p>News channels like CNN and NBC News reported that law enforcement officers said Robinson is 22 years old and lives in Utah.</p>
            <p>Cox explained, "On the evening of September 11, one of Robinson's family members contacted a family friend. This friend then told the Washington County Sheriff's Office that Robinson had told them, or suggested, that he was involved in the crime."</p>
            <p>Cox also said that Robinson's family told investigators that Robinson had become "more political" in recent years. This family member remembered that during a dinner, Robinson mentioned that Kirk was going to Utah Valley University. Robinson also talked about why he did not like Kirk and his ideas.</p>
            <p>Robinson reportedly told his family that he believed "Kirk was full of hate and spread hate."</p>
            <p>CNN reported that law enforcement officials said Robinson's father recognized his son from the photo shared by the authorities. He then called a young pastor for help. The pastor later contacted the police, and the suspect was arrested.</p>
            <p>Law enforcement has released Robinson's booking photo.</p>

            <h1>To Punish Buying Russian Oil: US Asks G7 Allies to Charge 100% Tariffs to China and India</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 12 (Central News Agency) â€“ The United States will ask its allies in the Group of Seven (G7) rich countries to put tariffs as high as 100% on China and India if they buy Russian oil. This is an effort to make Russian President Vladimir Putin stop the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>According to a US proposal seen by Bloomberg News, the United States will also suggest that G7 allies create legal ways to take frozen Russian money that belongs to the government. They would also consider using this money to help pay for Ukraine's defense.</p>
            <p>Most of Russia's frozen assets, which are about 300 billion US dollars (around 9.1 trillion New Taiwan Dollars), are located in Europe.</p>
            <p>Canada, which is currently leading the G7, is holding a meeting for finance ministers today. They will talk about more actions to put pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>Based on the US proposal, America wants to apply extra tariffs of 50% to 100% on China and India. It also wants to put limits on imports and exports. This is to stop Russia from trading energy and to stop technology that can be used for both military and non-military purposes from going to Russia.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately reply to Bloomberg's request for comment.</p>

            <h1>US and UK Warships Sail Through Taiwan Strait; Chinese Army Calls It Trouble and Provocation</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 12 (Central News Agency) â€“ The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command announced tonight that the US destroyer USS Higgins and the British frigate HMS Richmond sailed through the Taiwan Strait today. The PLA called this action "making trouble and provoking."</p>
            <p>Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said that the Eastern Theater Command sent naval and air forces to watch the ships' entire journey. They responded to the situation effectively.</p>
            <p>Shi Yi also stated that the actions of the US and UK send the wrong message and harm peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He said that the Eastern Theater Command's forces are always ready and will strongly protect China's sovereignty, safety, and regional peace and stability.</p>
            <p>Before this, on September 6, the Canadian Navy's frigate HMCS Ville de QuÃ©bec and the Australian guided-missile destroyer HMAS Brisbane sailed through the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that this showed both countries' strong will to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>On August 11, several Chinese and Philippine ships had a serious standoff in the Scarborough Shoal area of the South China Sea, where both countries claim ownership. After that, on August 13, the USS Higgins sailed into the Scarborough Shoal area.</p>
            <p>In September 2021, the HMS Richmond also sailed through the Taiwan Strait to show its right to freedom of navigation.</p>
