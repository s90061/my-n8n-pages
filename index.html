            <h1>Companies are Confused by 100% Tariff Plan on Chips and Semiconductors from US</h1>
            <p>New York, August 7th â€“ US President Donald Trump said this week that he would put a 100% tax on all computer chips and semiconductors coming into the US. This news made the prices of big semiconductor companies' shares go up. But many smaller companies are confused and want to know what this might mean for them.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Limor Fried, who started and works as an engineer for Adafruit Industries, a small electronics company in New York, said, "We are still waiting for official guidance."</p>
            <p>Adafruit uses chips from US companies and sellers, and also directly from companies in the Philippines and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Fried said that if these chips do not avoid the tax, "it will make our design costs higher, because semiconductors are the most expensive parts in our products... With many of these taxes, we usually have to wait until we get the bill to know the real impact. Then, we adjust our prices to cover the extra costs."</p>
            <p>The US directly imports a small number of chips. This is because most chips not made in the US are already put into products like cars and Apple's iPhones before they come into the US, or they are a part of those products.</p>
            <p>Martin Chorzempa, an expert on China at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said: "The real question for people in the industry is: will parts be taxed? This means, will chips inside devices need to be taxed separately?"</p>
            <p>When Trump announced on August 6th that he would put a 100% tax on chips and semiconductors coming into the US, he also said that companies promising to build factories in the US or already building them in the US would not have to pay these import taxes.</p>
            <p>Wall Street investors saw this news as a good thing, not just for US companies like Intel and Nvidia, but also for big Asian chip companies like TSMC and Samsung, which are working to build factories in the US.</p>
            <p>However, for smaller European and Asian chip companies, it has caused more uncertainty. These companies are not as involved with the big growth in artificial intelligence (AI), but their semiconductors are used in many common things like cars or washing machines.</p>
            <p>Infineon Technologies, a large German semiconductor company, said in an email on August 7th: "The company cannot guess about possible semiconductor tariffs and Trump's statement because no official documents have been released yet."</p>
            <p>Chorzempa pointed out that these manufacturers "might not be big enough to get special permission, and they probably don't have enough money or profit to support large investments in the US."</p>
            <p>The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said today that they "eagerly want to know more about the chip tariffs, including how widely they apply and how they will be set up."</p>

            <h1>Trump to Meet Leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan for Peace Talks</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 7th â€“ US President Donald Trump has announced that tomorrow he will meet the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. He calls this a "historic peace meeting" to stop the conflict between these two former Soviet countries, which has lasted for many decades.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump posted on his social media site "Truth Social" today. He said that Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev "will be with me at the White House for an official peace signing ceremony."</p>
            <p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have been enemies for many decades. They have fought two wars over the disputed Karabakh region. In 2023, Azerbaijan quickly took back this area from Armenian forces, which made more than 100,000 Armenian people leave the area.</p>
            <p>The two countries have had many talks to find a peaceful solution, including meetings last month in the United Arab Emirates. But it has been hard to make a big step forward.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote, "These two countries have been at war for many years, causing thousands of people to die."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Many leaders in the past tried to end the war between the two countries, but they were not successful, until today, luckily, 'Trump' came along." He added, "My government has been in contact with both sides for some time." He also said, "I am very proud that these two brave leaders did the right thing."</p>
            <p>Trump has said before that he strongly believes his efforts to help solve various international conflicts deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
            <p>He said that Washington will sign agreements with both countries. They will "work with both countries to find economic opportunities so that we can fully use the potential of the South Caucasus region."</p>

            <h1>New Taipei City Launches Senior E-Sports Classes in September</h1>
            <p>New Taipei, August 8th â€“ New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih announced today that e-sports classes for older people will start in September at the New Taipei E-Sports Base. This is a new partnership between social welfare and the e-sports industry. It aims to create a place for learning e-sports not just for young people, but also for older people to try games and feel good about their achievements.</p>
            <p>Today, the New Taipei City Government held an "Intergenerational Fun, Continuous Happiness" e-sports event for old and young people at the New Taipei E-Sports Base. Mayor Hou Yu-ih joined older people and young people to form teams. They played "G9: Special Ops Alliance," "Street Fighter 6," and "Just Dance Unlimited," showing their quick reactions and teamwork.</p>
            <p>Hou Yu-ih said that usually when he visited the e-sports base, he mostly saw young people. Now, he is very happy to see older people enjoying themselves here too. He said that e-sports is not just a competitive sport; it is also a way to relax. Also, playing games can make family relationships better. He hopes every older person can enjoy the happiness that e-sports brings.</p>
            <p>Hou Yu-ih said that by the end of July this year, there were 789,042 people aged 65 or older in New Taipei City. This is nearly 20% of the city's total population. As society becomes very old, New Taipei City has senior clubs in every neighborhood and 612 community care centers. Now, they are also adding e-sports to help older people improve their digital skills and thinking abilities. This also helps with hand-eye coordination and managing feelings, which supports a happy life where people "create, grow old, and live well together."</p>
            <p>Ye Yu-nu, over 70, said in an interview that she used to be against her children and grandchildren playing video games, which caused some tension in her family. After her son-in-law talked with her, she watched and saw that e-sports helped her grandchildren relax and think. It did not affect their studies; instead, it helped her grandchildren connect their studies with a path for themselves. Ye Yu-nu also used e-sports to train her hand-eye coordination and improve her thinking, and she often invited friends to play against her.</p>
            <p>Zhu Kefen, the head of the New Taipei E-Sports Industry Association, said that the e-sports learning program for older people shows being active, taking on challenges, and mixing different generations. Through guidance from professional coaches and fun classes, older people can improve their digital skills and make their lives more fun. It also opens up more conversations and connections with their children and friends.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Social Affairs Department said that these e-sports classes for older people will start in September. The exact schedule is still being planned. They expect to have 3 classes and accept 60 students. Registration will be open from August 13th to August 27th, and the list of accepted students will be announced on August 28th. If too many people sign up, students will be chosen by a computer lottery. Information on how to register will be posted on the New Taipei City Social Affairs Department's Facebook page or the New Taipei E-Sports Base's Facebook page.</p>
