            <h1>Left-Handed Player Lin Jun-yi Beats World No. 6, Reaches Quarterfinals in China Badminton Masters</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's strong left-handed badminton player, Lin Jun-yi, won his match today. He beat Jonatan Christie from Indonesia, who is ranked 6th in the world. Lin Jun-yi won with scores of 21-5 and 22-20 in the Round of 16 at the BWF Super 750 China Masters tournament. This win means he has moved on to the quarterfinals.</p>
            <p>Lin Jun-yi is ranked 15th in the world. Before this game, he had played against Christie three times and lost all of them. Today, he finally won his first match against Christie.</p>
            <p>In the first round (Round of 32), Lin Jun-yi played against Lee Zii Jia from Malaysia. But Lee Zii Jia had to stop playing in the third game because he was hurt. So, Lin Jun-yi easily moved on to the Round of 16.</p>
            <p>Today, Lin Jun-yi played against Christie again. Christie is 28 years old and won a gold medal at the Asian Games in 2018. In the first game, Lin Jun-yi played almost perfectly. He was losing 1-2, but then he scored 12 points in a row. This put him ahead, and Christie could not fight back.</p>
            <p>The second game was very close and difficult for both players. The score was tied 15 times. But Lin Jun-yi played steadily until the end. He also used clever shots at the front and back of the court. When Christie had a chance to win at 20-19, Lin Jun-yi saved the point. Then, Lin Jun-yi scored two more points and won the game in a great comeback.</p>
            <p>Also, another Taiwanese team, Wang Chi-lin and Chiu Hsiang-chieh, played in the men's doubles Round of 16 today. They played against Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty from India. The Taiwanese team lost quickly in only 33 minutes, with scores of 13-21 and 12-21. This is the ninth time this season they have stopped at the Round of 16.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Mitag Forms; September Still a Busy Month for Typhoons, Second Only to August</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Mitag started this afternoon. The Central Weather Administration (CWA) says that the middle and end of September are still busy times for typhoons. Statistics show that September has the second highest number of typhoons each year, with an average of 5.04. August has the most, with an average of 5.39 typhoons.</p>
            <p>Tropical Depression No. 20 has become a weak typhoon named Mitag. The CWA also said that Tropical Depressions No. 21 and 22 might also become typhoons today.</p>
            <p>The CWA posted on its Facebook page, "Report Weather - Central Weather Administration," that long-term data (from 1958 to 2024) shows about 25 to 27 typhoons form each year in the Northwest Pacific Ocean and South China Sea. Most of these typhoons, 70% of the total, happen from July to October.</p>
            <p>The CWA says that the number of typhoons slowly starts to increase in spring as the weather gets warmer. In April and May, about one typhoon forms each month. In June, nearly two typhoons form.</p>
            <p>In summer and autumn, the CWA notes that July to October is the busiest time for typhoons. August has the most, with an average of 5.39 typhoons. September is next with 5.04 typhoons. In July and October, about four typhoons form each month.</p>
            <p>The CWA also said that many people think there will be fewer typhoons after summer vacation. However, typhoons are still very active in September and October.</p>
            <p>As cold air from the north moves south, typhoon activity slowly becomes less frequent. The CWA said that sometimes typhoons still form at the end of the year. There have even been "New Year's Eve typhoons." On average, about two typhoons form in November and about one in December.</p>
            <p>The CWA stated that January to March is the quiet season for typhoons. But sometimes typhoons still form during these months. However, the number is much lower, with about one typhoon forming in total during these three months.</p>
            <p>The CWA reminds people that these statistics are averages over a long time. This does not mean every year will be the same. The number of typhoons changes each year. Historically, the year with the most typhoons was 1964, with 37. The year with the fewest was 2010, with only 14.</p>
