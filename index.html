            <h1>IMF Changes Taiwan's Growth Forecast for 2025 to 3.7% in New Report</h1>
            <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said today that Taiwan's economy is expected to grow by 3.7% in 2025. The IMF also raised its prediction for the world's economic growth this year. This is because problems with taxes on imported goods and money matters were not as bad as first thought.</p>
            <p>In its newest report, called "World Economic Outlook," the IMF said Taiwan's actual economic growth (GDP) for this year will be 3.7%. This is more than the 2.9% they predicted in April. For 2026, they now expect 2.1% growth, which is less than the 2.5% they said in April.</p>
            <p>The report also said that prices for things people buy in Taiwan will go up by 1.7% this year. This is a bit less than the 1.8% they expected in April. Next year, prices are predicted to go up by 1.6%, which is the same as their April report.</p>
            <p>For jobs, the report expects that the number of people without jobs in Taiwan will stay at 3.4% for both this year and next year.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that the IMF also said in its new report that the U.S. has recently made trade agreements with some important countries. This stopped bigger taxes on goods that U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened. Other countries also did not get back at the U.S. with their own taxes. Because of this, the IMF has raised its world growth prediction for the second time since April.</p>
            <p>The IMF now thinks the world's actual GDP will grow by 3.2% in 2025. This is more than the 3.0% they thought in July and also more than the 2.8% from April. The IMF believes world economic growth will still be 3.1% in 2026, which is the same as their July prediction.</p>
            <p>But the IMF also warned that if Trump starts a trade fight with China again, it could slow down the world's economy a lot.</p>
            <p>Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist at the IMF, said that taxes on goods were lower than expected. Also, businesses around the world were quick to plan, buy goods early, and change their supply chains fast. Other things that helped were that Europe and China spent more money to help their economies, the U.S. dollar became weaker, and many people invested in Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>Mr. Gourinchas said, "Overall, things are not as bad as we worried, but they are worse than we thought a year ago, and not as good as we need them to be."</p>
            <p>The IMF's main prediction is that the U.S. economy will stay strong. They expect it to grow by 2.0% in 2025, a little more than the 1.9% predicted in July. For 2026, U.S. GDP growth is expected to be 2.1%. This is also a bit higher than in July, but still less than the 2.8% growth in 2024.</p>
            <p>The Eurozone's growth prediction also went up a little, from 1.0% in July to 1.2%. This is mainly because Germany is spending more money to help its economy, and Spain continues to show strong economic activity.</p>
            <p>Japan's growth prediction for 2025 went up a lot to 1.1%, which is more than the 0.7% predicted in July. For 2026, growth is expected to go down to 0.6%, but this is still 0.1% higher than the July prediction.</p>
            <p>The IMF's prediction for China's growth stayed the same. They expect 4.8% growth in 2025 because of more exports, but they said this might not last. For 2026, China's growth is predicted to be 4.2%.</p>

            <h1>Bloomberg: EU Considers Making Chinese Companies Share Technology to Be More Competitive</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg News has reported that the European Union (EU) is thinking about new rules. If Chinese companies want to work in the EU, they might have to share their technology with European companies. This plan aims to make EU businesses stronger and more competitive.</p>
            <p>People familiar with the plan said these rules would be for companies that want to enter important markets like car making and battery production, which use a lot of digital technology. The rules might ask companies to use a certain amount of EU products or workers. They might also need to add more value to their products inside the EU. Making joint companies with European businesses is also one idea they are thinking about.</p>
            <p>Those familiar with the matter said these rules are expected to start in November. Technically, they would apply to all companies not from the EU. The main goal is to stop Chinese manufacturing from becoming too strong and harming European industries.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg also said that if the EU uses similar methods to China to protect its own businesses, China might react strongly. This could hurt the trade relationship between the EU and China, which is still very important for both sides.</p>

            <h1>Oracle and AMD Work Together to Use MI450 AI Chips for Cloud Services</h1>
            <p>Oracle and AMD announced today that Oracle will offer new cloud services using AMD's MI450 artificial intelligence (AI) chips. This shows that both companies see a big demand for the technology needed to run AI tools like ChatGPT, and they are working together to get more business.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that, according to their plan, Oracle will first install 50,000 MI450 processors by the third quarter of next year. Then, they will use even more chips in 2027 and the years after.</p>
            <p>This partnership gives AMD another important customer for its new chips. Because of this news, AMD's stock price went up by more than 3% before regular trading today.</p>
            <p>Also, many companies are trying to get more computing power to develop AI. This new partnership means Oracle can offer more kinds of processors to its customers.</p>
            <p>Oracle and AMD said, "The need for a lot of AI computing power is growing quickly because the new types of AI models are getting bigger than what current AI systems can handle."</p>
            <p>Last week, AMD announced that it had signed a contract to supply AI chips for several years to OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT. Before this, AMD and OpenAI also worked together to make the MI450 design better for AI tasks.</p>
            <p>OpenAI is building a large facility that will use MI450 chips next year. This facility will have 1 gigawatt (GW) of power. It has also been reported that OpenAI has signed one of the biggest cloud computing deals ever with Oracle. OpenAI plans to buy about $300 billion (around 9.21 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) worth of computing power over about five years.</p>
