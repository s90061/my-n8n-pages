            <h1>Canada Stops Electric Car Rule Due to US Tariffs</h1>
            <p>On September 5, Vancouver reported that US President Trump's tariffs have greatly hurt Canada's economy. Today, Canada announced new plans to improve its economy. These plans include stopping the "electric vehicle mandate" and starting a "Buy Canadian" policy.</p>
            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that the government wants to make Canada's economy the strongest among the G7 countries. They will rely less on other countries so they can handle global economic problems better. He said, "The world is uncertain, so we are making Canada stronger from the inside to help our workers and businesses succeed."</p>
            <p>One important part of the new plan is to stop the rule for electric vehicles (EVs). This is because the car industry asked for this change.</p>
            <p>In 2022, the Canadian government made a rule that 20% of new light-duty cars sold in Canada in 2026 must be electric. The goal for 2030 was 60%, and by 2035, all passenger cars sold in Canada had to be electric. This was to reach zero carbon emissions. Car makers or importers who did not meet these goals could be punished.</p>
            <p>After the US put new tariffs on Canadian cars, the car industry criticized this "electric vehicle mandate." They said the goals were not possible, would cost too much, and would risk jobs. By June this year, only about 8% of new cars sold in Canada were zero-emission vehicles.</p>
            <p>Now, Carney's government has announced they will remove the 2026 goal of having 20% zero-emission light-duty cars. They will also review the electric vehicle policy for 60 days.</p>
            <p>"Buy Canadian" is another main point. This policy asks the federal government to prioritize "Canadian businesses and products" when buying things and giving money. They will also create a plan for provinces and cities to do the same. Ottawa plans to start parts of this idea by October this year and fully put it into action by spring 2026.</p>
            <p>Other plans include: starting a "Skills Retraining Program" to help 50,000 workers improve their skills through digital job training. Creating a fund of 5 billion Canadian dollars (about 110 billion New Taiwan Dollars) to help industries affected by tariffs. Giving more money to canola farmers and businesses hurt by high Chinese tariffs. Making business loan programs longer and bigger to help small and medium businesses with money problems. Creating a plan to trade with more countries, aiming to increase Canada's exports to non-US markets by 50% by 2030.</p>
            <p>Since February this year, when Trump put many tariffs on Canadian goods because of border security, trade between Canada and the US has been difficult. Even though these tariffs later only applied to goods not covered by the "USMCA agreement," the US still added more tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, copper, and cars.</p>
            <p>Talks about tariffs between the US and Canada are still happening. Trump and Carney recently had a long phone call. Carney said the "mood was good," but this does not mean US tariffs will disappear soon.</p>

            <h1>EU Fines Google 100 Billion, Ignoring Trump's Threats</h1>
            <p>On September 5, Brussels reported that the European Union (EU) announced a large antitrust fine of 2.95 billion Euros (about 105.4 billion New Taiwan Dollars) against the American tech giant Google. The reason is that Google favored its own advertising services.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the EU still decided to fine Google, even though US President Trump had warned against targeting big American tech companies.</p>
            <p>The European Commission accused Google of unfairly hurting competition in the market across the 27 EU member countries. Google quickly said it would appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>Teresa Ribera, the EU's competition chief, said, "Google used its strong position in ad tech to harm publishers, advertisers, and consumers. This action is against EU antitrust rules."</p>
            <p>Trump had threatened to get back at the EU for trying to limit big US tech companies. However, after thinking for a few days, the EU decided to go ahead with the fine. Earlier this week, it was rumored that the EU's trade chief had stopped the fine because of worries about US retaliation. This showed that there were different opinions within the EU team about whether to fine Google.</p>
            <p>The EU is still waiting for the US to keep its promise from a trade agreement made in July. In that agreement, the US promised to lower tariffs on European cars.</p>
            <p>Since 2021, the EU has been investigating Google's ad tech business. In 2023, it suggested that Google sell some of its advertising services to make the market fair again.</p>
            <p>Google, which is part of the US-based Alphabet company, believes the European Commission's decision is "wrong" and will appeal.</p>
            <p>Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's head of global regulatory affairs, stated, "This ruling puts unfair fines on us. The changes it asks for will hurt the profits of thousands of European businesses."</p>
            <p>Mulholland added, "Providing services for both buyers and sellers of ads is not a monopoly. Today, there are more different choices in the market than ever before."</p>

            <h1>Poor US Job Data Makes European Stocks Fall Due to Economic Worries</h1>
            <p>On September 5, London reported that European stock markets closed lower today.

However, it also made people worried about the future of the economy.</p>
