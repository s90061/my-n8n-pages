Taipei, July 15 (CNA) San-Yuan Energy, a company under TCC Group, had a fire at its Xiaogang factory on July 14. TCC Chairman Chang An-ping stopped his work overseas and came back to Taiwan. He went to the factory and said they will fully investigate what caused the fire. They will also hold people strictly responsible. This is to make sure their high-tech customers around the world can continue their business and get their orders on time.

Also, TCC announced today that the San-Yuan Energy battery factory has stopped all work. They are not sure yet if they will have to pay a fine. They are still checking how this will affect their money and business.

TCC said in a press release that Chang An-ping arrived at the factory today and listened to reports from senior managers. He learned that the factory had not communicated well with the local community. So, he asked senior managers from the main office and San-Yuan Energy to form a special group. This group will work to improve communication with nearby residents. They will make sure information is clear and answer any worries from the community.

Chang An-ping pointed out that the San-Yuan factory uses many automatic sensors in the formation area where the fire started. There are over 332,800 temperature sensors and 17,400 smoke sensors. They also have different steps for emergency response. But this event clearly shows that the system did not work as well as expected.

Chang An-ping stressed that a special team has been set up to investigate. Now, the most important thing is to cool down the area. Then, they will go back into the factory to check computers and cameras. They will look at all the information. They will also check records of all related equipment and how it was set up. This will help them find out why the system's reaction was different from what happened. They will find out if it was a management problem, a human error, or if the machines themselves had problems.

Chang An-ping said that inside the company, they will hold people very strictly responsible. If there was any mistake in management or any person was at fault, they will follow company rules. Outside the company, they will also hold manufacturers responsible. Especially since the company that provided the factory's production equipment is a famous global company. They should have a lot of experience with battery production equipment. They will deeply investigate if their equipment had any faults or problems in its design. They will immediately take legal action and ask them to pay for damages and make improvements.

Chang An-ping noted that Molicel, the company's battery brand, is Taiwan's only top international brand in the important battery supply chain. International customers need a lot of high-end batteries from Molicel. This event could greatly affect the global high-tech industry. He hopes to reduce the impact on customers' orders as much as possible. San-Yuan Energy's parent company, E-One Moli Energy, has started checking and moving production at its Southern Taiwan Science Park factory. They want to make as many batteries as possible to help with affected orders. (Edited by Lin Shu-yuan) 1140715

***Starbucks in North America Requires Employees to Come to the Office 4 Days a Week; Those Who Disagree Can Leave***

Seattle, July 14 (CNA) The American coffee company Starbucks today asked some managers who work from home to come back to the office. Also, company employees will now need to work in the office 4 days a week, instead of the earlier rule of 3 days.

The Associated Press reported that Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol sent an internal letter to employees. He said that starting in early October, employees must work in the office 4 days a week, not 3 days as before.

Starbucks, which is based in Seattle, said that its corporate "people managers" must return to work at the Seattle headquarters or the Toronto office within 12 months. In February this year, the company only asked managers at the vice president level and higher to work in Seattle or Toronto.

Starbucks said that individual employees who report to these managers will not be asked to move to the offices. But for all future job openings and transfers, employees will need to work in Seattle or Toronto.

Niccol wrote in the letter: "We are building our office culture again because working together brings the best results. We will share ideas more effectively, solve problems creatively, and act faster."

Niccol said that if affected employees do not want to move, they can choose a "voluntary leaving program" and receive payment when they leave.

Many employees got used to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, over the past year, more and more companies have asked employees to return to the office. Big employers like Amazon, AT&T, and the US federal government have all asked employees to come to work 5 days a week. Jobs that allow full remote work are very popular.

Starbucks spokesperson Lori Torgerson said she could not say how many employees are currently "people managers" or are allowed to work remotely. Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, including coffee roasters and warehouse staff. (Translated by Lin Yi-feng / Edited by Shi Shi) 1140715
