            <h1>Trump: Thinking About Land Attack on Venezuela Drug Groups</h1>
            <p>News from Washington D.C. on October 15 (Reuters) â€“ Today, President Trump of the United States said he is thinking about sending soldiers to attack drug groups in Venezuela. Before this, the U.S. had already attacked Venezuelan ships suspected of carrying drugs many times. These attacks sometimes caused deaths.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that a reporter asked Trump in his White House office if he would consider a land attack. Trump answered, "We are indeed considering actions on land now because we have control of the situation at sea."</p>
            <p>Reuters also reported that Trump confirmed a story from The New York Times today. He has given permission for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to do secret work in Venezuela.</p>
            <p>The New York Times was the first to report this news. The information came from U.S. officials who knew about this secret order.</p>

            <h1>India's Foreign Policy Change? Trump: Modi Promises to Stop Buying Russian Oil</h1>
            <p>News from Washington D.C. on October 15 (Reuters) â€“ Today, U.S. President Donald Trump said that India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, told him that India will stop buying oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump spoke to reporters at a White House event. He said, "I was not happy that India was buying Russian oil. But today, he (Modi) told me they will not buy oil from Russia anymore. This is a big step forward. Next, we will make China do the same."</p>
            <p>In recent years, the United States and India have made their relationship stronger. This happened during Trump's first time as president because both countries were worried about China becoming more powerful.</p>
            <p>However, after Trump came back to the White House, the future of the U.S. and India working together against China changed. This was because India did not want to stop buying Russian oil, and Trump put many extra taxes on Indian goods.</p>
            <p>Reuters also said that the war between Russia and Ukraine is still going on. Washington is trying harder to reduce the money Russia gets from selling oil. If India truly promises to stop buying Russian oil, it could be a very important moment in how countries deal with energy around the world.</p>
