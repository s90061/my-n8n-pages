Taiwanese baseball player Song Sheng-jui from the CTBC Brothers team will participate in the All-Star Home Run Derby. He said he always wanted to join since he was a child, especially after seeing players like Lin Chih-sheng compete. Song's main goal is not to get hurt and not affect his performance in the regular season. He hopes to hit more home runs than his teammate Chiang Kun-yu, who hit zero in the 2023 derby.

**Tesla Model Y Launches in India with High Price Due to Taxes**

Tesla has launched its Model Y car in India, priced at about US$70,000 (around NT$2.05 million). This is the highest price for the Model Y in any major market. Tesla hopes to boost sales in India, a country where CEO Elon Musk has criticized high taxes. The Model Y will compete with luxury cars from BMW and Mercedes-Benz, not local electric cars. The cars sold in India are made in China, as US factories do not produce right-hand drive cars for India.
