            <h1>US-India Alliance Against China Changes as Trump Criticizes India's High Taxes</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 1st (CNA) â€“ Indian Prime Minister Modi showed unity with leaders from China and Russia at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. At the same time, US President Trump said today that India charges very high taxes on US products. India had offered to lower these taxes to zero, but Trump said it was too late.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Modi was at the SCO summit in China. There, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke about his idea for a new global safety and economic system. He wants to put "Global South" countries first, which directly challenges the US.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the US and India have made their relationship stronger. This happened even during Trump's first time as president because both countries were worried about China becoming more powerful.</p>
            <p>But when Trump came back to the White House, the future of the US-India alliance against China changed. This was because India did not stop buying oil from Russia, so Trump added a 25% tax on goods from India.</p>
            <p>Trump posted on his social media platform "Truth Social" today: "Few people understand that we do very little business with India, but India does a very large amount of business with us. In other words, they sell us many goods and are our biggest 'customer,' while we sell them very little."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Because India has charged us very high taxes until now, the highest among all countries, our businesses cannot enter India. This is a completely unfair situation! Also, India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia and very little from the US."</p>
            <p>Trump also claimed, "They (India) are now offering to lower the taxes to zero, but it is too late. They should have done this earlier."</p>

            <h1>Russia's Drone Attacks on Ukraine Fell in August During US Peace Talks</h1>
            <p>Kyiv, September 1st (CNA) â€“ In August, Russia used far fewer long-range drones to attack Ukraine. This is according to a report from Agence France-Presse (AFP), based on information from Ukraine's air force. This happened when many important talks were held to try and stop the war between Russia and Ukraine, but these talks did not succeed.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the information released today shows Russia sent 4132 long-range drones in night attacks on Ukraine in August. This is 34% less than in July, which was the highest number of attacks in one month ever.</p>
            <p>In August, US President Donald Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and then with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the United States. However, these meetings did not lead to any big steps towards peace.</p>
            <p>AFP's report only used official daily updates from the Ukrainian air force each morning. It does not include every single Russian attack.</p>
            <p>Even though Russia attacked Ukraine less with drones in August, dozens of ordinary people still died.</p>
            <p>For example, on August 28th, Russian forces launched one of their worst drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. This attack killed 25 people, mostly people living in an apartment building.</p>
            <p>Since Moscow started a full war against Ukraine in February 2022, which caused the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, drone or missile attacks have happened almost every night in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Since May of this year, Russia has even sent long-range drones to attack Ukraine every night without stopping for even one day.</p>

            <h1>"Brush" Tsai Cheng-yi, a County Council Member, Detained for Money Laundering</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung, September 1st (CNA) â€“ Tsai Cheng-yi, also known as "Brush," is a county council member from Chiayi. He does not belong to any political party. He was once in prison for a professional baseball match-fixing scandal. Now, he is involved in a case about breaking money laundering laws. Yesterday, he was taken in by prosecutors from Qiaotou. After questioning, the prosecutors decided that Tsai Cheng-yi needed to be held in custody. So, tonight, they asked the Qiaotou court to keep him.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office explained tonight that they have been looking into cases where gambling websites might be involved in money laundering. Yesterday, police and prosecutors searched places and arrested Tsai Cheng-yi and others at Taoyuan International Airport. They were arrested for possibly breaking money laundering laws and other crimes.</p>
            <p>After questioning by the prosecutor, it was believed that Tsai Cheng-yi is highly suspected of committing crimes. There was a reason and need to hold him. So, the Qiaotou District Court was asked to keep him in custody without allowing visitors, due to his suspected involvement in money laundering and other crimes. Also, a person named Pei, who was a leader in the money laundering operation, was allowed to be released on bail for NT$100,000.</p>
