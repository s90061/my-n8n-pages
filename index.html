A recent survey suggests that most companies plan to spend more money on artificial intelligence (AI) in 2024. This increase shows that businesses want to improve how they work and create new things faster. Many leaders see AI as a key tool for staying competitive in today's market.

While there are some worries about AI possibly causing job losses, the survey also points out that AI could lead to the creation of new types of jobs. Companies are looking at AI for tasks like automating daily operations, improving customer service, and analyzing large amounts of data to make better decisions. This major investment in AI is expected to change how many businesses operate around the world.

**Hybrid Work Changes City Life and Daily Routines**

The rise of hybrid work, where people split their time between working from home and the office, is significantly changing cities and daily life. City centers, especially business districts, are seeing fewer people during the traditional workweek. This affects businesses like coffee shops, restaurants, and retail stores that rely on office workers. Public transport services also notice a change in how many people travel during peak hours.

On the other hand, residential areas are becoming more active during weekdays. More people are at home, which means local shops and services in neighborhoods might see more customers. Cities are starting to adapt to these changes by rethinking how central areas are used. Some are trying to attract more residents to downtown areas or creating more spaces for entertainment and social activities, rather than just offices. The full long-term effects of hybrid work on cities are still developing.

**2023 Confirmed as Warmest Year on Record**

Scientists have confirmed that 2023 was the hottest year globally since records began in 1850. Data from the European Union's climate service showed that the average global temperature reached 1.48 degrees Celsius higher than levels before industrialization. This number is dangerously close to the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit that countries agreed upon in the Paris Agreement to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

The record-breaking heat was mainly caused by the ongoing increase in greenhouse gases from human activities. A natural weather pattern called El NiÃ±o, which warms the Pacific Ocean, also added to the rising temperatures. As a result, the world experienced more extreme weather events in 2023, including severe heatwaves, long droughts, and powerful floods. This news highlights the urgent need for governments and people to take faster action to reduce carbon emissions and protect the planet.`;
