A new survey from IBM shows how top business leaders around the world see artificial intelligence (AI) affecting their companies and employees. The survey included over 3,000 CEOs and found that many believe AI will bring big changes.

About 75% of these leaders think that AI will mean their employees need to learn new skills. More than half, 59%, expect AI to change the types of jobs available at their companies. Interestingly, 34% of CEOs now plan to reduce jobs because of AI, which is more than in a similar survey done last year. However, a large majority, 87%, also see AI as a way to help their businesses grow and improve how current employees work.

This suggests that while AI might replace some tasks, it is also expected to create new opportunities and change existing roles. CEOs are focusing on how AI can make their businesses more productive by automating certain jobs. This shift means that companies will need to focus more on training and developing their staff. The survey also highlighted that trust and ethical concerns are important when using AI in the workplace.

**The Evolving World of Hybrid Work: New Challenges Emerge**

Hybrid work, where employees split their time between working from home and coming into the office, remains a popular choice for many companies and their staff. However, new challenges are now appearing as this way of working becomes more common.

Companies are finding it difficult to make sure hybrid work is fair and effective for everyone. For example, some employees who work from home more often might feel disconnected or believe they are missing out on important discussions that happen in the office. Managers are also finding it harder to lead teams when some members are physically present and others are remote. There are growing concerns about career progression for those who choose to work from home most of the time.

To deal with these issues, businesses are trying different approaches. Some are setting clear rules about which days employees must be in the office, often focusing on "collaboration days" for teamwork. Others are investing in better technology to connect remote and office-based staff. Despite these difficulties, many employees still value the flexibility that hybrid work offers, showing that companies must continue to adapt to this changing work culture.

**Climate Change Reshaping Global Travel**

Extreme weather events around the world are increasingly affecting how people travel and choose their holiday destinations. From intense heatwaves and damaging floods to widespread wildfires, these events are directly impacting the tourism industry.

Many popular holiday spots are becoming too hot or unsafe during their usual peak seasons. For example, countries in the Mediterranean have experienced record-breaking temperatures, and places like Hawaii have faced devastating wildfires. As a result, travelers are changing their plans. Some are choosing cooler destinations, while others are opting to travel during the off-season to avoid the worst weather. There's also a growing trend of "cool-cationing," where people choose holidays in colder regions like Scandinavia.

The effects of climate change also include displacement of people, which can strain local infrastructure and affect the visitor experience. In response, there is a rising demand for sustainable travel options. Airlines and hotels are under pressure to reduce their environmental impact. The travel industry as a whole must adapt to these climatic changes, perhaps by building more resilient infrastructure or promoting different kinds of tourism that are less affected by extreme weather.`;
