            <h1>Swiss Re: Los Angeles Wildfires Helped Cause $135 Billion in Natural Disaster Losses in First Half of 2025</h1>
            <p>Swiss Re, a large insurance company, said today that natural disasters caused about 135 billion US dollars in economic damage around the world in the first half of 2025. Wildfires in Los Angeles made this amount much higher.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Swiss Re is a company that provides insurance for other insurance companies. They said that the losses in the first half of 2025 were more than the 123 billion US dollars lost in the first half of 2024.</p>
            <p>This big company from Zurich believes that out of the total losses in the first half of this year, 80 billion US dollars were paid by insurance. This amount is almost twice the average for the past 10 years, when adjusted for 2025 prices.</p>
            <p>Swiss Re stated that the large fire in Los Angeles in January was the biggest wildfire insurance claim so far. It caused about 40 billion US dollars in damage.</p>
            <p>The company explained that the very serious damage from the Los Angeles fire was due to long periods of strong winds, not enough rain, and many expensive single-family homes in one area of the United States.</p>
            <p>Swiss Re also said that the damage from wildfires has grown quickly in the last 10 years. This is because the world is getting warmer, droughts are happening more often, and rain patterns are changing. Also, more areas outside cities are being built, and more expensive properties are located there.</p>
            <p>The company added that most of the fire damage came from the United States, especially California. In California, dangerous areas are growing the most.</p>
            <p>Before 2015, payments for wildfire insurance were only about 1% of all money paid for natural disasters. Now, they are 7%.</p>

            <h1>US Lawmaker Writes to Intel Board, Questions CEO Lip-Bu Tan's China Ties</h1>
            <p>Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from the US, sent a letter today to Frank Yeary, the independent chairman of Intel's board. In the letter, he asked questions about Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. Senator Cotton is concerned about Mr. Tan's connections with Chinese companies and a recent criminal case involving Cadence Design, Mr. Tan's former company.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Senator Cotton's letter showed his worries about Intel's business safety and honesty, and how this could affect America's national security.</p>
            <p>He asked if Intel's board knew that Cadence Design had received a legal order when Lip-Bu Tan was their CEO. He also asked what Intel's board has done to deal with these worries.</p>
            <p>Intel is part of the "Secure Enclave" plan, which was started by former President Biden's government. This plan aims to make sure that microelectronic parts for defense are safe. Because of this, Senator Cotton also asked if Intel's board had asked Mr. Tan to stop his investments in Chinese chip companies connected to the Chinese military or the Chinese Communist Party. He also asked if Mr. Tan had fully told them about his relationships with other Chinese companies.</p>
            <p>Since Intel gets money from the government for this plan, Senator Cotton's letter asked Mr. Yeary to explain how Mr. Tan has shared information about his investments, professional roles, or other connections with Chinese companies.</p>
            <p>Senator Cotton said, "Intel has a duty to use American taxpayers' money well and follow all safety rules... Mr. Tan's network of connections makes people wonder if Intel can do these duties."</p>
            <p>An Intel spokesperson said in a statement that "Intel and Mr. Tan are strongly committed to US national security and to being honest in our defense work." Intel also said that the company will talk to Senator Cotton about the things mentioned in his letter.</p>
            <p>Also, last week, Reuters reported that Cadence Design agreed to say they were guilty and pay over 140 million US dollars. This was to settle charges that they sold chip design products to a Chinese military university. People believe this university was involved in simulating nuclear explosions.</p>
            <p>Lip-Bu Tan led Cadence Design for more than 10 years. He is a Malaysian-born Chinese-American business manager. He became Intel's CEO in March this year. Mr. Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design from 2008 to December 2021. This time includes when the company sold the chip design products. He was also the executive chairman until May 2023.</p>
