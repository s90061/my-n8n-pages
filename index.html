            <h1>BlackRock and Nvidia Teams Lead Investment in AI Data Center, Acquire Aligned for 1.2 Trillion</h1>
            <p>A team of investors, including BlackRock and Nvidia, announced on October 15th that they will buy Aligned Data Centers. They will pay 40 billion US dollars, which is about 1.224 trillion New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>More and more AI technology needs a lot of data centers. These centers are expensive and hard to get. This big deal happened because many companies want to get these important resources for AI.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this purchase shows how fast big companies around the world are building AI computer systems. They are all trying to get the main resources needed to train AI models like ChatGPT. OpenAI, which made ChatGPT, recently made many deals. They now have about 26 gigawatts (26 billion watts) of computing power. This is enough electricity for about 20 million American homes.</p>
            <p>The group of investors is called "AI Infrastructure Partnership" (AIP). They first plan to use 30 billion US dollars of their own money. The total investment could reach 100 billion US dollars, including money from loans. This is AIP's first investment. The deal is expected to finish in the first half of 2026.</p>
            <p>Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock and head of AIP, said: "We are investing in Aligned Data Centers to reach our goal of providing the main systems for the future of AI."</p>
            <p>Other important investors in the AIP group include xAI, owned by Elon Musk, and Microsoft. Also, Kuwait Investment Authority, a fund from Kuwait, and Temasek, a state-owned investment company from Singapore, are part of the group.</p>
            <p>Aligned designs, builds, and runs data centers especially for very large cloud companies (hyperscalers), new cloud businesses, and other companies. They currently have 50 data center areas. Their total power, both working and planned, is more than 5 gigawatts. This includes projects being built in some parts of the United States and Latin America. The company's main office will stay in Dallas, Texas, USA. Andrew Schaap, the CEO, will continue to lead the company.</p>
            <p>Recently, the high interest in AI has caused a big increase in demand for money for large data centers. Earlier this year, Aligned successfully raised 12 billion US dollars. This was one of the biggest amounts in the industry. But as the market continues to grow, they are raising even more money.</p>
            <p>To support the building of AI systems, big tech companies, new companies, and private investment funds have spent hundreds of billions of US dollars. Last week, OpenAI announced a deal with AMD for 6 gigawatts of AI computer chips. They also have the option to buy shares. Before this, it was known that Nvidia planned to invest up to 100 billion US dollars in OpenAI and provide at least 10 gigawatts of data center systems.</p>
            <p>Morgan Stanley estimates that big cloud companies like Google's parent company Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft, and Coreweave will quickly invest 400 billion US dollars this year just for AI infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Even though some people are worried about whether these big investments will make enough money, big tech companies say they will keep spending more on building data centers. Recently, many related investments have happened in the AI industry. This has made people wonder if the market is seeing a "cycle of investment."</p>
            <p>Nvidia has often been a main investor in AI deals recently. Nvidia is also the world's biggest maker of graphics processing units (GPUs). They have a very strong position in the market.</p>

            <h1>Forum 2000: Former US Official Says American Strategy Must Include Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Mark Lambert, who used to be a high-level official for Asia-Pacific affairs at the US State Department, spoke at the "Forum 2000" in the Czech Republic on October 13th. He said that the United States' plan must include a strong plan for Taiwan. If China blocks Taiwan, the world economy could lose trillions of US dollars, and Europe would also be affected. He added, "The only way to stop China from growing stronger is for all countries to work together."</p>
            <p>The 29th "Forum 2000" was held in Prague, Czech Republic, from October 12th to 14th. Mr. Lambert was asked to speak at a discussion called "China: When Will Its Expansion Stop?" He shared ideas with experts from Taiwan, Japan, Tibet, and Africa on how to deal with China's influence and threats.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lambert used to be the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Asia-Pacific Affairs at the US State Department. He led the Taiwan Coordination Office within the East Asia Bureau. He has a lot of experience in Asia. He worked twice at the US Embassy in Beijing, where he managed political and military matters between the US and China. He also worked in Hanoi, Bangkok, and Tokyo.</p>
            <h2>The US made a plan for the Indo-Pacific region to work together with friends.</h2>
            <p>Mr. Lambert said at the forum that during the first time President Trump was in office, China tried to change how international groups and organizations worked and what they meant.</p>
            <p>He gave an example: "China talked about 'win-win' situations. But in their way of speaking, this really meant: we only talk about things we both agree on, like trade and investment. We avoid sensitive topics like human rights, Xinjiang, and Tibet."</p>
            <p>He said that at that time, one important job for the US government was to make other countries more aware of China's actions. This was to stop China from controlling how international rules are made. This effort continued when President Biden became president. It slowly became part of a bigger plan called the "Indo-Pacific Strategy."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lambert stressed that this is a very important plan because the Indo-Pacific area is key for America's economy, safety, and politics.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that America's studies show that only China has enough power in diplomacy, economy, and military to completely change the world order that was set up after World War II. If no one acts against China, it might actually succeed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lambert remembered that when they were making the Indo-Pacific Strategy, the US government decided to stop different departments from working separately. This was to deal with China's many challenges. "In the past, economists only looked at money, trade officials only talked about trade, security experts only cared about military, and human rights officials only talked about human rights. We need to look at China's issues in a more complete way."</p>
            <p>The United States also worked closely with allies like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the European Union. They all made their own versions of the Indo-Pacific strategy and analyzed the challenges.</p>
            <p>He noted that China plays a leading role in the new relationship between Moscow and Beijing. "Without China's financial help, Russia's attack on Ukraine could not continue."</p>
            <h2>The US plan must include Taiwan and teach the world why Taiwan is important.</h2>
            <p>When talking about big challenges in world strategy, Mr. Lambert explained, "At sea, China is trying to make the South China Sea its own 'Chinese lake.' It also wants to control the East China Sea and Yellow Sea, making these areas like inside waters. On land, the clearest goal is Taiwan."</p>
            <p>He said that America's plan must include a strong "Taiwan strategy." This plan should help the world understand why Taiwan is important. Mr. Lambert strongly said: "Taiwan is the eighth biggest trading partner for the United States. If China blocks Taiwan, the world economy would lose trillions of US dollars. Many European countries were surprised when they learned they would also be greatly affected. So, it's very important to raise awareness."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lambert believes that technology is the most important battleground today. China has clearly said it wants to be the world leader in areas like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors, and biotechnology. These technologies can be used for military purposes and become new, very destructive powers.</p>
            <p>He explained that the United States uses a "small yard, high fence" plan. This means: "Even though we trade a lot with China, we will never help China become a leader in technologies that could be used against us. This requires the United States to have special industry rules and teamwork, which has not happened much since World War II."</p>
            <p>Also, he warned that China helps hundreds of electric car makers. Now, these makers produce high-quality electric cars. "If there are no protective measures, these cars could destroy the car industries in Japan, South Korea, Europe, and North America. This could cause millions of jobs to be lost around the world."</p>
            <h2>China avoids human rights issues; Lambert asks countries to unite.</h2>
            <p>Talking about problems inside China, Mr. Lambert said that the situations in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong are still very serious. He emphasized that companies should make sure their supply chains do not use forced labor. "If European companies process tomatoes grown in Xinjiang, they must also check that forced workers did not pick them. Otherwise, these products cannot be sold in the United States."</p>
            <p>He stated that as the Dalai Lama is getting old, China has started making plans for his successor. "This is not only about peace in Tibet, but it could also affect Mongolia, Central Asia, and some parts of Russia."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lambert said that the United States also cares about Hong Kong. He also noted that Chinese security agencies send secret agents abroad to scare people who disagree with the government. "I have seen this happen in the San Francisco Bay Area myself. My European friends have also seen it in places like Germany and Switzerland."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lambert stressed that in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, the United States and its friends must offer help for development and other important resources that are not from China. Examples include food security and minerals.</p>
            <p>He said that the United States has real experts on China around the world. They act like "traveling teachers" at embassies, helping to train and share experiences with friendly nations. However, Mr. Lambert also said he is worried about the current situation. He plainly stated, "Today, there is no clear plan for China in Washington D.C."</p>
            <p>Despite this, Mr. Lambert remains hopeful. The United States might not be the only leader anymore. It will work together with Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Europe. "The only way to stop China from growing stronger is for us to stand together."</p>

            <h1>Lin Tai-hua Prepares 4 Large Boxes of Documents to Prove Innocence; Green Party Ethics Committee Still Has No Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was accused of illegally taking money meant for her assistants. Today, she brought four large boxes of documents to the DPP's Ethics Committee to explain her side. She said the prosecutors purposely left out evidence that would help her case. She hopes for a fair primary election for Kaohsiung City mayor. After the meeting, Chiu Chun-yen, the head of the DPP Ethics Committee, said they could not make a decision today. They will wait to see if there is new information before their next regular meeting.</p>
            <p>It was found that Lin Tai-hua and others illegally took more than 14 million New Taiwan dollars (NTD) in assistant fees. In June, prosecutors in Kaohsiung charged nine people. Prosecutors also found that Lin Tai-hua's sister helped to falsely claim over 320,000 NTD, with a top monthly salary of 130,000 NTD. Today, her sister was also charged with corruption and other crimes.</p>
            <p>At the end of July, Lin Tai-hua personally went to the DPP Ethics Committee to explain. But at that time, the committee could not make a decision. They asked her to provide more detailed evidence. The Ethics Committee met again today to discuss the case. Lin Tai-hua came to the committee in the evening with four large boxes of documents. She spoke for more than 90 minutes.</p>
            <p>Chiu Chun-yen said after the meeting that Lin Tai-hua's lawyers prepared over 600 pages of statements. These statements gave many good reasons for her side. However, the case is very wide-ranging, and some information still needs to be checked. Also, the Ethics Committee asked about the connection between her sister's charges and the assistant fees case. Since her sister was only charged this morning, and the official charge document has not even been seen yet, Lin Tai-hua could not give a full explanation.</p>
            <p>Chiu Chun-yen said that the prosecutor is still investigating a case about political donations. It is not clear when new information will come out. The Ethics Committee decided that "they still cannot make a decision today. They might wait to see if there is any new progress before the next regular meeting."</p>
            <p>The media was concerned about the upcoming primary election. However, Chiu Chun-yen said, "We never think about the primary election. If we did, our position would not be fair." But Lin Tai-hua is a well-known person in society. If they are to punish her, the evidence must be clear. "We have not reached that point yet." As for when Lin Tai-hua will be asked to explain again, Chiu Chun-yen said that a date has not been set. They will decide based on how the case develops.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Lin Tai-hua released a statement. She said she respects the legal process and will fully help to find out the truth. She stands by the values of being honest, hardworking, and loving her home country. She asked everyone to trust that she is innocent.</p>
            <p>She said that after her lawyers read the case files, they found that the prosecutors used evidence against her that was wrong or not true. Many pieces of evidence that would help her were purposely not included. She said she cannot share the details outside of court. She asked reporters interested in the case to attend the Kaohsiung District Court on October 27th to understand why.</p>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua stated that her sister, Lin Tai-chen, has helped with 1,875 cases for people needing help since 2002. She worked very hard. When there were not enough public assistants, her sister took on all the extra work, and her salary changed because of this, which is allowed by law. Lin Tai-hua asked, "My sister has been an assistant for over 20 years. Is it right that she supposedly stole over 300,000 NTD?"</p>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua said that the media reported her sister earned 130,000 NTD every month. But actually, in 20 years, there was only one month when she earned 130,000 NTD. Her sister worked day and night, 24 hours a day, with no weekends or public holidays, even during the Lunar New Year. She showed photos to prove it, saying, "Almost everywhere I was in Kaohsiung, my sister was there. Everyone in Kaohsiung knows this, but the investigators don't. They even said my sister is a fake assistant."</p>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua hopes that the truth will come out soon. She wishes for a fair primary election process for the 2026 Kaohsiung City mayor for the Democratic Progressive Party.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the DPP Ethics Committee also discussed the case of Chen Wen-chih today. He is a former deputy speaker from New Taipei City, also a DPP member, who was accused of illegally taking assistant fees. Chiu Chun-yen said that Chen Wen-chih was found guilty in the first court ruling. So, the Ethics Committee decided to suspend his party membership for three years.</p>
