https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240603-why-are-so-many-young-people-quiet-quitting-social-media

A new trend shows that many young people are changing their relationship with social media. Instead of completely deleting their accounts, they are using platforms like Instagram and TikTok much less often. They might stop posting, limit their time online, or only use social media for very specific reasons. This new behavior is being called "quiet quitting" social media, a term first used for people doing less at work.
Experts say there are several reasons for this change. Many young people feel tired from constantly being online and comparing themselves to others. They worry about their mental health and how social media makes them feel. Some also find it takes too much effort to create the perfect online image. Privacy is another big concern for them.
As a result, some young people are moving to more private ways of communicating, such as messaging apps with small groups of friends. Others are joining smaller, special interest communities online. This shift suggests that young people are looking for a healthier and more meaningful way to connect digitally.

**AI Changes How Companies Hire, But Worries About Fairness Remain**

https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ai-powered-hiring-takes-root-recruiting-raises-concerns-about-bias-2024-06-21/

More and more companies are now using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help them hire new employees. AI tools can quickly read many rÃ©sumÃ©s and even help with job interviews. This can save businesses a lot of time and money, making the hiring process faster and more efficient.
However, there are growing concerns about how fair these AI systems really are. Critics worry that AI might learn old biases from past hiring data, which could lead to unfair decisions. This means some groups of people, like women or minorities, might be unfairly overlooked for jobs. If the AI is biased, it could stop companies from hiring a diverse workforce.
Governments and organizations are starting to pay attention to these issues. They are discussing new rules to make sure AI is used responsibly in hiring. Some companies are also working on ways to make their AI systems more transparent, so itâ€™s clear how they make decisions. They are also checking their AI tools regularly to ensure they are fair for everyone.

**Popular European Destinations Are Becoming More Eco-Friendly**

https://edition.cnn.com/travel/europe-greenest-destinations-report/index.html

A new report shows good news for travelers: many well-known tourist places in Europe are becoming more environmentally friendly. These destinations are working hard to protect nature and local culture, making them more sustainable for the future.
For example, cities and regions are improving their public transportation systems, so visitors can get around without needing cars. They are also getting better at managing rubbish and increasing their use of clean energy sources, like solar power. There's a growing focus on protecting local traditions and natural areas from the negative effects of tourism.
This positive change is happening for two main reasons. Firstly, more and more travelers want to visit places that care about the environment. Secondly, the destinations themselves want to reduce their impact on the planet. Even though there are still challenges, like too many tourists in some areas and the effects of climate change, these efforts show a promising future for green travel in Europe.`;
