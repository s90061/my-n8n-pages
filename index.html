Many people today spend a lot of time looking at their phones and computers. This can sometimes make us feel tired, stressed, or lonely, even though we are connected online. Experts are now talking about the importance of a "digital detox," which means taking a break from digital devices.

A digital detox doesn't mean you have to stop using technology completely. It's about finding a balance and making sure technology doesn't control your life. Taking time away from screens can help you in many ways. For example, you might sleep better, feel less anxious, and have more energy. It can also help you focus on the people around you and enjoy real-life activities more.

To start a digital detox, you can try setting limits on how long you use apps each day. You can also turn off notifications, or put your phone away during meals and before bedtime. Instead of scrolling, you might try reading a book, going for a walk, or spending time with friends and family without distractions. Even short breaks from your devices can make a big difference to your well-being.

**WORK: How AI is Changing Jobs**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the way people work around the world. While some worry that AI will take away jobs, experts say that it will more often change existing jobs and create new ones. The biggest impact of AI is not just replacing human workers but making certain tasks faster and more efficient.

Companies are starting to use AI tools for things like data analysis, customer service, and writing reports. This means that workers will need new skills to work alongside AI. Key skills for the future include critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. These are human skills that AI cannot easily copy. Also, being able to learn new technologies and adapt to change will be very important.

Workers who learn to use AI tools effectively will have an advantage. For example, a marketing professional might use AI to write first drafts of emails, allowing them to focus on strategy and creative ideas. This trend means that continuous learning will be a vital part of professional life for everyone.

**TRAVEL: The Rise of Sustainable Tourism**

More and more people are now choosing to travel in ways that are better for the planet and local communities. This trend is called "sustainable tourism." Travelers are becoming more aware of how their trips can affect the environment and the people who live in the places they visit.

Sustainable travel means making choices that reduce harm and create positive impacts. For example, travelers might choose to fly less, use public transport, or stay in hotels that focus on being eco-friendly. They also try to support local businesses, eat local food, and buy handmade products directly from the people who make them. This helps keep money within the local economy and supports traditional crafts.

This approach to travel also encourages visitors to learn about and respect local cultures and traditions. By traveling sustainably, tourists can enjoy a more meaningful experience while helping to protect natural beauty and support the well-being of the communities they visit. Itâ€™s about making sure future generations can also enjoy these amazing places.
