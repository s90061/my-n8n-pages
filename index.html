Premier Cho Jung-tai announced that the 2025 Town Resilience (Air Defense) Exercise will start on July 15. When people hear air raid sirens or receive national alerts, they should stay calm and find shelter nearby. Those who do not follow the rules may be fined up to NT$150,000.

This year, the "Wan An" (air defense) and "Min An" (civil defense) exercises are combined into the "Town Resilience Exercise." It will take place from July 15 to 18 at different times in different areas. During the exercise, there will be air raid sirens, evacuation drills, and traffic control. After the air raid alert ends, local governments and civil defense teams will practice setting up relief stations, first aid stations, and disaster rescue.

Premier Cho listed the schedule: on July 15, the exercise will be in Miaoli, Taichung, Nantou, and Changhua. On July 16, it will be in Kaohsiung and Pingtung. On July 17, it will be in Yilan, Keelung, Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, and Hsinchu (city and county). These exercises will be from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM. On July 18, it will be in Hualien, Taitung, Kinmen, Lienchiang, and Penghu from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM. Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan will not participate due to disaster relief efforts.

**Flying Shelter Destroys Chiayi House, Volunteers Help Repair**

After Typhoon Danas hit, a house in Dongshi Township, Chiayi County, had its roof damaged by a flying shelter. The Hope Volunteer Group learned about this and removed the shelter. This weekend, they will help repair the roof, which is expected to take two days, so the family has a safe home.

The head of the Hope Volunteer Group, You Rui-feng, said that after the typhoon, volunteers went to Chiayi and Tainan. They saw that there was no water or electricity, and fallen trees blocked roads. Elderly and weak people needed immediate food, so the volunteers brought food to them.

The volunteer group often helps build or repair homes for disadvantaged families across Taiwan. Since the typhoon, they have received over 40 reports of damaged homes. After reviewing the situations, the group decided to focus their efforts in July and August on rebuilding or repairing homes for those affected by the typhoon. This weekend, they will be in Dongshi Township, Chiayi County.

**Han Kuang Exercise: M109A2 Howitzers Counter Enemy Landing in Tainan**

The "Han Kuang 41" exercise of the Taiwanese military took place today in Tainan. The exercise simulated an enemy landing in Tainan, and M109A2 self-propelled howitzers were used to attack the enemy from behind, supporting the front-line defense forces.

The 564th Brigade Artillery Battalion performed the exercise. The scenario involved intelligence showing the enemy approaching for a beach landing. While front-line defense units dealt with the initial threat, the artillery unit carried out "area firepower elimination" from the rear. Five units in the Tainan operational area cooperated, each firing for about 10 minutes. Many military enthusiasts came to watch.

During the drill, the firing command post received orders to begin the mission. Six M109A2 self-propelled howitzers were set up, each with a crew. They received instructions from the command post to adjust their direction, distance, and angle. Once ready, the firing officer raised a flag, and the gunners pulled the firing rope to shoot, showing the military's combat readiness.
