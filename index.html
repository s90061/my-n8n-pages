A 21-year-old man, Zhou Ziyun, hit a female dentist named Shen last month at a clinic in Taipei. He said it was because cleaning his teeth hurt too much. Police found out that Chen Zhongyi, who runs Earth Village, asked a leader from the Zhulian Gang Jingan Branch, Xia Weiyong, to help him with a debt of over ten million dollars. Yesterday, six people were arrested. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office decided that Xia Weiyong and his follower, Zhou Wenhan, should be held in custody because they are serious suspects and might do it again. A court decided today that Xia Weiyong and Zhou Wenhan will be held without visitors. Now, a total of three people, including Zhou Ziyun, are in custody.

Xia Weiyong, also known as "Xia An," said that he was asked by Chen Zhongyi to help with the debt. However, he said he never threatened the female dentist. He claims he only talked to her calmly about how to return the house deed. He also said he doesn't know Zhou Ziyun and didn't tell him to hit anyone. He doesn't know why the dentist was hit.

Dr. Shen said that she lent Chen Zhongyi 15 million NT dollars. But Chen Zhongyi did not pay her back. After she won in court, Chen Zhongyi kept asking gang members to "discuss the debt." He said he would only pay back the money if he got the house deed first, which Dr. Shen believes was a trick to avoid paying her.

Police found that Chen Zhongyi borrowed 15 million NT dollars from Dr. Shen and another person named Liu. Chen used his house deed as security and gave it to Dr. Shen. In April this year, after getting the money, Chen asked Xia Weiyong to "handle" the return of the house deed. Liu was also threatened because of this issue.

Police found that Xia Weiyong, Yan Daozhi, and Zhou Wenhan went to Dr. Shen's clinic to talk. During the meeting, they said their gang's name, which scared the dentist. When the talk didn't work, they told Zhou Ziyun to pretend to get his teeth cleaned and then hit Dr. Shen.

On the day Dr. Shen was hit, the clinic's air conditioning was being fixed, so there were no appointments in the morning. However, Zhou Ziyun came in and insisted on seeing the dentist. He saw a camera in front of the dental chair and kept asking to change seats. Luckily, Dr. Shen refused, so the attack was recorded. Because Dr. Shen was almost badly hurt, the prosecutors had already asked to hold Zhou Ziyun without visitors, which was approved. Today, the court decided that Xia Weiyong and Zhou Wenhan will also be held without visitors. In total, three people are now in custody for this case.

**May 2025 Was Second Hottest May on Record, High Chance of Being One of Top 5 Hottest Years**

Taiwanâ€™s Central Weather Bureau announced today that May 2025 was the second hottest May ever recorded. This information comes from new climate reports for May 2025 by Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The global average temperature in May was 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than before the industrial age. The NCEI also said that 2025 is very likely to be one of the five hottest years ever, with more than a 99% chance.

In May, many places around the world experienced very high temperatures. On May 24, the United Arab Emirates had its hottest May day ever, reaching 51.6 degrees Celsius. Iceland had its worst May heatwave ever, with over 90% of weather stations reporting new high temperatures for May. France also had a severe heatwave in May, with the national highest temperature reaching 30.5 degrees Celsius on May 30. This was France's hottest May on record and only the second time since 1947 that the temperature went above 30 degrees Celsius in May.

The Central Weather Bureau also noted that the amount of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean has been at or near its lowest historical levels since the beginning of this year. While it improved slightly in April, it still reached the lowest level for May in the last five years. The ice is melting faster than usual. The situation with Antarctic sea ice is also serious, with some areas having almost no ice left.

The bureau added that the world's oceans are experiencing "marine heatwaves," with unusually high temperatures. This is causing big problems for ocean life and for the environment and economy along the coasts. It could also make climate change worse.

The Central Weather Bureau stated that global warming continues to affect areas worldwide. The global average temperature from January to May 2025 was the second highest ever recorded. The NCEI also said that there is a very high chance, more than 99%, that 2025 will be one of the five hottest years in history.

**Guangzhou Jinan University Removed from List of Recognized Chinese Universities After 10 Years**

The Ministry of Education recently updated its list of recognized universities and higher education institutions in mainland China. The list now includes 154 universities and 191 higher vocational schools. Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from this list. This is the first change to the list in ten years. After its removal, there are still 154 universities and 191 higher vocational schools on the list.

Earlier this year, the Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said at a meeting of university presidents that schools linked to China's United Front Work Department have special purposes and are not truly academic. He stated that stopping cooperation with such schools is necessary and that the Ministry of Education will no longer recognize degrees from them.

The Ministry of Education recently removed Guangzhou Jinan University from its official list of recognized higher education institutions in mainland China. The Ministry stated that Jinan University in mainland China has been managed by the United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students study in a normal academic environment and because learning places should not have specific political goals, Guangzhou Jinan University was taken off the list.

The Ministry of Education also said that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, orderly, fair, and respectful. Schools that organize exchange activities for students going to China should follow Taiwan's policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of the activity, the organizers, the schedule, and any materials. These activities should not have political goals or content. Also, schools should avoid accepting one-sided invitations from China or helping with China's policies and political messages.

Additionally, the Ministry of Education said that if schools are unsure about the organizers or plans of an activity, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for help. The Ministry still hopes to help young people from both sides learn and understand each other, but during exchanges, students should be aware of potential risks and check the background of the organizers and if there are any political aims.
