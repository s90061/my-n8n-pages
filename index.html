            <h1>Putin Attends China's Parade, Russia Launches Big Air Attack on Ukraine</h1>
            <p>Ukraine and Poland said today that Russia launched a large air attack on Ukraine late yesterday. This attack hurt at least four railway workers. It also made Poland quickly send up its fighter jets to protect itself.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this air attack happened while Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Beijing. He was there for a military parade to remember the end of World War II. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned that the world has to choose between "peace and war."</p>
            <p>Ukrainian officials and news reports said that alarms rang for many hours in many parts of the country. People heard explosions in nine regions, from Kyiv to Lviv and Volyn in the west.</p>
            <p>Poland, which is Ukraine's neighbor to the west and a member of NATO, sent its own and allied fighter jets into the air to be safe.</p>
            <p>The Polish Armed Forces Command said on social media platform X that "the Russian Federation has again attacked targets inside Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Ukraine's state railway company said on Telegram that four railway workers in the Kirovohrad region were hurt in the Russian attack and went to the hospital. The company also warned that many train routes would be delayed because railway buildings were damaged.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's emergency services said that the Russian attack on the Znamianka district in the Kirovohrad region hurt five people and damaged 28 homes.</p>
            <p>Public transport in the western city of Khmelnytskyi was also "very disturbed" by the air attack. Local government said that there were fires and damage to homes and other buildings in the area.</p>
            <p>Russia did not say anything about this attack right away. Since Russia fully invaded Ukraine in February 2022, both sides have repeatedly said they do not attack civilians.</p>

            <h1>Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation Supports "Taiwan Online News Self-Regulation Alliance" to Show Commitment to Self-Control</h1>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation and 22 other news media from different areas have announced that they are starting the "Taiwan Online News Self-Regulation Alliance." This alliance will create professional rules, a clear system for self-control, a way for people to complain, and a "news trust badge." These steps will help people trust the media again.</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Television (TITV) and Alian Indigenous Radio Station (Alian Radio), which are part of the Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation (IPCF), have been actively involved since the planning stage. They are now founding members of the alliance. This shows that indigenous media are committed to self-control, professionalism, and cultural responsibility.</p>
            <p>On the day the alliance started, it also announced its self-regulation system. This brings new energy to Taiwan's media world. First, it will create a system for people to complain. This lets the public share their opinions directly. It helps media be more responsible and encourages people to get involved. Second, it will form a self-regulation and advisory committee. This committee will include media members, outside experts, and public groups. It will help deal with disagreements and make rules. Lastly, it will introduce a "news self-regulation trust badge" to help make online news more trustworthy.</p>
            <p>Digital Development Minister Lin Yi-ching said in a press release, "A democratic country needs freedom of speech. But a democratic country also cannot let wrong or fake information spread widely, as this can harm the safety of the whole country."</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation also believes that having indigenous media (TITV and Alian Radio) join is very important. For a long time, indigenous issues were often ignored or reported incorrectly. Only indigenous-led media can speak for these issues well, keeping cultural context and truth together. By joining the self-regulation alliance, they not only show their commitment to good media rules but also act as cultural protectors. They bring different views and deep cultural meanings to Taiwan's media world.</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation will continue to use culture as its base. Through media power, it will lead the voices of indigenous groups to a wider public stage. It will also work with all its partners to protect truth, seek fairness, and bring more trust and hope to democratic society.</p>
