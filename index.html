            <h1>Zheng Li-wen becomes KMT leader; DPP has two hopes and one warning.</h1>
            <p>The election for the Kuomintang (KMT) leader finished today. Former legislator Zheng Li-wen won and is now the KMT chairperson. Wu Zheng, a spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said tonight that the DPP has "two hopes and one warning" for the new KMT leader. The DPP hopes the KMT will discuss politics clearly and calmly, putting the country's good before their party's good. They also hope the KMT will work together to face current challenges to Taiwan's safety.</p>
            <p>In a press release tonight, Wu Zheng explained the two hopes. First, he hopes the new KMT leader will strongly support Taiwan's independence and protect Taiwan's safety more than the party's own benefits. Second, he hopes the KMT will be a wise and active voice in the parliament. They should stop blocking things because of old ideas. They should also not suggest laws that hurt Taiwan or are against the constitution.</p>
            <p>For the warning, Wu Zheng said that during the KMT leadership election, it was clear that China tried to get involved and influence it. He warned the new KMT leader and everyone in the party to be very careful. When it comes to national security, there is no middle ground and no room for mistakes. Both parties should work together to make the country safer and stop China's attempts to interfere. The KMT should not help China's information war for their own party's gain.</p>

            <h1>Trump's visit to Asia: CNN says his team is thinking about a meeting with Kim Jong Un.</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 18 (CNA) â€“ CNN reported today, citing sources, that President Trump's team is secretly talking. They are looking at whether he might meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming trip to Asia.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that American officials have not yet started to plan the meeting or contacted North Korea directly. Earlier this year, America tried to set up a meeting, but it failed because North Korea reportedly refused to accept a letter from Trump to Kim Jong Un.</p>
            <p>In August, after Trump met South Korean President Lee Jae-myung at the White House for the first time, he publicly said he was interested in meeting the North Korean leader.</p>
            <p>Reuters could not immediately check the CNN report, and the White House has not yet said anything about it.</p>
            <p>Regarding Trump's trip to Asia, CNN reported that trade problems between the US and China are growing. Because of this, the White House is more focused on planning his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>However, Trump has always said, both in public and private, that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un. Also, American officials have always been open to the idea of Trump meeting the North Korean leader during his Asia trip. During Trump's first time in office, officials arranged a handshake between the two leaders at the border between North and South Korea in less than 48 hours after Trump tweeted an invitation. This shows that things can change very quickly.</p>
            <p>At the same time, North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong Un also said he was open to meeting Trump when he spoke at North Korea's top people's meeting last month.</p>
            <p>At that time, he said: "For me, I have good memories of US President Trump. If the US can stop their empty obsession with getting rid of nuclear weapons and is willing to try to live peacefully with North Korea, based on what is real, then we have no reason not to talk with the US."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Series: Rakuten Monkeys win first game. Pedro Fernandez will pitch for Monkeys, Brandon Leibrandt for CTBC Brothers in Game 2.</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 18 (CNA) â€“ The Rakuten Monkeys baseball team won their first game in the championship series today. Their coach, Kubo Kenji, said that the fans in the left outfield were even louder than the home team's fans, and he thanked them very much. Tomorrow, Pedro Fernandez will start for the Monkeys, and Brandon Leibrandt will start for the CTBC Brothers.</p>
            <p>Today, the Rakuten Monkeys won the first championship game against the CTBC Brothers with a score of 3 to 0. This was a very important win. Kubo Kenji said, "The players have been playing many games, so they are a bit tired. But no player said anything about it. Everyone tried their best on the field. Our coaching team also helped the players from behind."</p>
            <p>Kubo Kenji also thanked the Monkeys fans who cheered loudly in the guest section of the left outfield today. "We saw our Rakuten fans from the start of practice. The first row to the top rows were all full. Today, their cheering was as loud as the home team's fans. We are very thankful that they came to cheer for us."</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, the Monkeys will have their top pitcher, Pedro Fernandez, start the game. He will play against Brandon Leibrandt, the starting pitcher for the Brothers. Fernandez was the best pitcher in the league this season, winning the most games and striking out the most players. He won 15 games and struck out 168 players. His ERA was 2.01. Leibrandt started 14 games this season, winning 7 games and losing 3. His ERA was 1.94.</p>
            <p>In this game, the Monkeys scored runs after Lin Li stole a base in the first inning and Lin Tzu-wei stole a base in the third inning. Kubo Kenji said these two stolen bases were sometimes planned and sometimes the players decided to steal on their own. "Both players were very brave to steal bases. Their brave choices were key to scoring points today."</p>
            <p>Also, in the fourth inning, Chen Chen-wei hit a single. Then, when the left fielder Tseng Sung-en and second baseman Yueh Tung-hua were not paying attention, he ran to second base. Kubo Kenji said that Chen Chen-wei saw what the other team's left fielder (Tseng Sung-en) was doing and thought about how strong his throw would be. "He found a mistake made by the other team and successfully moved to the next base. It was a very good base running play."</p>
