            <h1>Venezuela Says US Military Took Fishing Boat in Its Waters: A Challenging Act</h1>
            <p>Venezuela said today that the US military held a fishing boat from Venezuela in its special economic waters for 8 hours. This happened when US warships were in the Caribbean Sea to fight drug groups.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Venezuela's foreign ministry said the US warship "USS Jason Dunham" illegally and unfriendily took one Venezuelan fishing boat yesterday. The boat had 9 fishermen on it.</p>
            <p>The statement said: "The warship sent 18 armed people onto the boat. They controlled this small, harmless fishing boat for 8 hours." The statement also called this event "a direct challenging act that used too much military power illegally."</p>
            <p>Venezuela's foreign ministry believes that the people who ordered this action "are looking for reasons to make the conflict in the Caribbean Sea worse. Their goal is" to make the government in Caracas change.</p>
            <p>The statement also asked the United States to "immediately stop these actions that put the safety and peace of the Caribbean region in danger."</p>
            <p>The situation between the US and Venezuela has become more difficult in recent weeks. This is because US President Donald Trump has put more pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro. Also, the US has sent warships to the southern Caribbean Sea.</p>
            <p>The US says that Maduro, who is a leftist leader, is in charge of a group that smuggles cocaine. Recently, the reward for finding him was doubled to 50 million US dollars (about 1.52 billion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, the US military destroyed a boat in the Caribbean Sea that they thought was carrying drugs. 11 people died. Trump said the boat belonged to a Venezuelan crime group called "Tren de Aragua," which is connected to Maduro.</p>

            <h1>Will Trump Visit Beijing? Former Official Says New US-China Trade Talks Are Important</h1>
            <p>People are interested in when a meeting between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will happen. While top US and Chinese defense and foreign officials have been talking, new trade talks between the two countries will start tomorrow. A former US diplomat said that China wants President Trump to visit Beijing. The discussions between trade officials will decide how big of a "gift" Trump will get for his visit. This will decide if the visit happens.</p>
            <p>News reports say that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will travel to Spain. There, they will talk with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and other Chinese economic officials. They plan to discuss trade and other money-related issues. This includes worries about national security caused by the short video app TikTok.</p>
            <p>Kurt Tong, a former US diplomat who now works for The Asia Group, a consulting company, recently spoke to CNBC. He said that, as far as he knows, Donald Trump has received an official invitation to visit China, and both sides are actively discussing it.</p>
            <p>He believes the most important meetings and talks will be between Bessent and He Lifeng. They must discuss how big the "gift package" is that Trump wants from China. This package needs to be big enough to make his visit to China worthwhile.</p>
            <p>Tong used to be the US Consul General to Hong Kong and Macau and a senior official in the State Department's economic office. He said that it looks like there's about a 2 in 3 chance the visit will happen, but it's not decided yet. In the end, what is in the "gift package" will decide if this visit happens, or if Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in a different way.</p>
            <p>He thinks that the new talks between the US and China might include things like agreements for China to buy products such as airplanes and soybeans. Or they might set a goal for how much China will buy from the US. TikTok will definitely be one of the topics they discuss.</p>
            <p>About when the Trump-Xi meeting might happen, Tong said that China has suggested Trump visit China before he goes to South Korea for the APEC summit. Then, the leaders of the US and China would meet again during the APEC summit.</p>
            <p>The 2025 APEC summit will take place on October 31 in Gyeongju, South Korea.</p>

            <h1>Australia Will Spend 12 Billion Australian Dollars to Build Defense Places to Support AUKUS Submarine Deal</h1>
            <p>Australia announced today that it will spend 12 billion Australian dollars (8 billion US dollars) to build places for defense in Western Australia. This will help with the nuclear submarine agreement called "AUKUS."</p>
            <p>The AUKUS agreement was made in 2021 by Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Its goal is to give Australia nuclear-powered attack submarines starting in the next ten years. This is to respond to China's plans in the Indo-Pacific area. The government of US President Trump is now officially checking this agreement again.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Australia's Defense Minister, Richard Marles, said the planned area for these facilities is very important for Australia's industries that build and fix ships. It will help Western Australia keep building warships and also support Australia's plan for nuclear-powered submarines.</p>
            <p>Last year, the Australian government first put 127 million Australian dollars (84 million US dollars) into making the Henderson shipyard better. This shipyard is near Perth. They said they will spend billions more over the next 20 years to make it a main place for fixing the AUKUS submarine fleet.</p>
            <p>The AUKUS agreement is worth many hundreds of billions of US dollars. With this agreement, the US will sell several "Virginia-class" nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. Later, the UK and Australia will work together to build new "AUKUS-class" submarines.</p>
