The Mexican government has strongly criticized former US President Donald Trump's recent threat to impose a 30% tariff on goods from Mexico. They stated that this move is an "unfair agreement" and that they cannot accept it. The US informed Mexico about these tariffs, which are set to start on August 1st. Mexico is now looking for other ways to protect its businesses and jobs and hopes to be exempt from these new taxes. Around 80% of Mexico's exports go to the US, their biggest trading partner. Trump has often said that Mexico is not doing enough to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling, and he uses tariffs as a way to put pressure on them.
