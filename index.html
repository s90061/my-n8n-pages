            <h1>After the Landslide Lake Disaster, Rescue Work is Over. The main office will now help with recovery.</h1>
            <p>It has been almost one month since the landslide lake disaster at Matai'an Stream. Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that after the disaster prevention work is finished, the main coordination office will become a special meeting to help with recovery and rebuilding. Mr. Chen Chin-te, a minister without portfolio in the Executive Yuan, will lead this work.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said today that Premier Cho Jung-tai listened to a report about the disaster recovery. He noted that the first part of the emergency work for the landslide lake disaster is mostly done. So, after the typhoon prevention work, the coordination office will change into a special committee. Mr. Chen Chin-te will be the main person in charge. Mr. Lee Meng-yen, an advisor, and Mr. Hung Tsung-kai, head of the Eastern Taiwan Joint Services Center, will be assistants. They will take over the recovery and rebuilding tasks.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also reminded everyone to be very careful about Typhoon Fengshen, which might come this weekend. He said to "expect the worst and prepare well." Mr. Chi Lien-cheng, the chief coordinator of the office, will also help Hualien County Government practice a big evacuation drill on the 15th. This practice is like a real situation, and all government departments should help fully.</p>
            <p>In addition, Mr. Chi Lien-cheng explained today through video that a three-step plan for evacuating Guangfu Township during a typhoon is ready. If needed, a special alarm, like an air raid siren, will be used for the landslide lake. This will tell people to move to higher ground. Also, to keep clear rules for evacuation, volunteers will not be allowed to enter the disaster area starting from the 18th.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan's service station for disaster relief is now managed by the Eastern Taiwan Joint Services Center. Premier Cho reminded them to make sure that relief money is given out correctly, safely, and quickly. If it is hard to know exactly who was affected, the main government departments should check carefully and offer help. This is to protect people's rights and help those affected get the money soon.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare's Disaster Relief Foundation has collected almost NT$1.2 billion in donations. Premier Cho said thank you to everyone who cares about the disaster area. To help affected people get back to normal life faster, he asked the relevant government departments and the foundation to quickly process emergency relief and home support plans. After making sure the information is correct and the procedures are complete, they should give the money to the people as soon as possible.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Medical University System starts "Green Care" to do less dialysis and reduce carbon.</h1>
            <p>It is thought that in two years, more than 3 million people in Taiwan will have kidney disease. The Taipei Medical University System is working to make healthcare last longer. Their first step is "Green Kidney Care" in the kidney department. This helps patients delay or even stop needing dialysis. It also helps reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Mai-sze, the president of Taipei Medical University, said today at a press conference that "the best green care is for patients not to need dialysis." He said that a study with the international INSIDE CKD program showed that in 2022, about 2.5 million people in Taiwan had long-term kidney disease. This is 10.6% of all people. But most patients did not know they had kidney problems before their disease got to a late stage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Mai-sze also said that by 2027, the number of patients is expected to grow to 3 million. The cost of care will also increase to more than NT$62.18 billion. The risk of other health problems and death will also go up a lot.</p>
            <p>He then explained "Green Kidney Medicine." An Australian doctor first talked about this idea in 2009. It means finding the disease early, slowing it down, and doing less dialysis. This makes patients healthier and improves their life. It also uses fewer medical resources, which is better for the environment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Mai-sze said this idea is the same as President Lai Ching-te's plan for a "Healthy Taiwan." The Taipei Medical University healthcare system uses this plan to help about 50 patients each year avoid dialysis. The number of people needing dialysis and dying has gone down by 20%. This saves the national health insurance over NT$10 million.</p>
            <p>He gave blood dialysis as an example. This treatment uses a lot of resources. It is estimated that each patient uses over 74,000 liters of water and 1,963 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year. It also produces over 320 kilograms of waste.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wu Mei-yi, the Vice President for Research and Development at Shuang Ho Hospital, which is part of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, shared their work. She said that Shuang Ho Hospital has been actively changing to be more green. They use digital systems and reuse dialysis wastewater and waste. Between 2023 and 2024, they reduced carbon dioxide by 2,508 tons. This is like the amount of carbon 2,200 gasoline cars produce in one year. This is a very impressive result.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen Liang-yu, the Director-General of the National Health Insurance Administration, also spoke. She said that recently, many disasters have happened in Taiwan because of extreme weather, especially the event in Guangfu Township, Hualien. This reminds the government that the healthcare system needs to be "strong." This means the medical network must continue to work well when there are typhoons, floods, and other natural disasters.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen Liang-yu said that every time the Central Emergency Operation Center tells people to leave their homes during a disaster, they first ask, "Are there any pregnant women? Are there any dialysis patients?" If dialysis patients stop their treatment, their lives can be in danger.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen Liang-yu stated that about 7% of dialysis patients in Taiwan use peritoneal dialysis. This is more than Japan's 3% but less than other Asian countries. If we want dialysis patients to be more active, the number of people using peritoneal dialysis needs to increase. This will not only make Taiwan's healthcare system stronger but also help with sustainable healthcare and reduce medical wastewater.</p>

            <h1>New Life Insurance starts building T17, T18. City council members think it's to pressure the Taipei City Government, which should explain.</h1>
            <p>People are watching closely to see if NVIDIA will move into the T17 and T18 areas in Neihu Science Park. Today, Shin Kong Life Insurance held a groundbreaking ceremony. City council members from both blue and green political parties believe that Shin Kong's goal is to pressure the city government. They asked if Shin Kong thought about how NVIDIA feels. If the deal fails, the city government should explain quickly.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA's plans for the T17 and T18 sites in Neihu Science Park are stuck because of land rights. Today, Shin Kong Life Insurance held a groundbreaking ceremony there. Lin Wei-chun, the general manager of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings, told reporters that the company always acts legally and follows contracts and laws.</p>
            <p>City council members from both parties shared their thoughts. Chen Hsien-wei, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) city council member, said in a media group that citizens are tired of the "bad companies fighting with a useless city government." This makes people wonder if the ceremony was "fake groundbreaking, real pressure."</p>
            <p>Chen Hsien-wei said that since the city government chose to talk, Shin Kong should quickly offer a plan for discussion. If Shin Kong is worried about breaking promises and the city government is worried about favoritism, both sides should consider what the public expects. Shin Kong should also see that its company image is getting worse.</p>
            <p>Lin Yen-feng, another DPP city council member, also said that acting based on feelings cannot achieve big things. What should have been a good plan might lead to everyone losing. Shin Kong's actions are embarrassing the city government.</p>
            <p>Lin Yen-feng stated that Shin Kong suddenly held a groundbreaking ceremony, but the city government knew nothing about it. This is hard for people to understand. It seems that the T17 and T18 deal might break down. If it does, the city government should explain clearly to the public early.</p>
            <p>Chien Shu-pei, a DPP city council member, wrote on Facebook that Shin Kong's groundbreaking ceremony was not a normal start to construction. Shin Kong won the bid with a low price, but they left the land empty for three years. Even the urban design review was only approved in June this year, and many changes were made. According to the Taipei City Building Management Office, they have not yet received any documents from Shin Kong to report the start of construction for T17 and T18.</p>
            <p>She said that Shin Kong's groundbreaking ceremony was not reported, not legal, and a "fake political photo opportunity." She also said that Mayor Chiang Wan-an went to Tainan for a visit today instead of staying in Taipei for this issue. She questioned if he can lead the development of the city's industries.</p>
            <p>Hsu Hung-ting, a Kuomintang (KMT) Taipei City Council member, wrote on Facebook that this is a "low-level move." He said he finally saw today a "countryside legend" he heard about as a child but never saw. He added that if they want to be fair, they should talk properly to solve their own problems. He believes that if they don't have a strong position but still cause trouble, it's just about "greed."</p>
            <p>Tseng Hsien-ying, another KMT Taipei City Council member, also posted on Facebook. He said that NVIDIA's chips are the strongest, but they cannot solve the complex political and economic situation in Taiwan. He believes the city government should cancel the contract with Shin Kong. NVIDIA is stuck because of Taiwan's complicated political, economic, and legal situation. He asked, "Has anyone thought about how NVIDIA feels?" And when will NVIDIA be able to rent the land and start building?</p>
