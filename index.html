            <h1>Reuters: Beijing Asks Chinese Stock Firms to Stop Digital Asset Business in Hong Kong</h1>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported, citing two sources, that China's securities regulator has told several Chinese stock brokerage firms to stop their "real-world asset" (RWA) tokenization business in Hong Kong. This shows that Beijing is careful about the growing interest in digital assets outside of mainland China.</p>
            <p>RWA tokenization is when traditional assets like stocks, bonds, funds, or even real estate are turned into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain. In recent months, many Chinese companies, including stock firms, have started RWA tokenization in Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>According to people who know about this, at least two important Chinese stock firms have received unofficial advice from China's securities regulator in recent weeks. They were asked to stop their RWA business activities outside mainland China.</p>
            <p>One of the sources said that this new advice aims to improve how risks are managed for this new type of business. It also wants to make sure that the companies' advertisements are supported by strong and legal business practices.</p>
            <p>In the past year, Hong Kong, an important financial center in Asia, has worked hard to become a hub for digital assets. Many companies, including Chinese stock firms, are ready to start businesses there, such as virtual asset trading, investment advice, or managing virtual assets.</p>
            <p>However, China, which used to be the biggest center for Bitcoin trading and mining in the world, is now very careful about digital assets. This is especially true after 2021, when China stopped cryptocurrency trading and mining to keep its financial system stable.</p>
