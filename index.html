            <h1>SpaceX Starship 10th Test Flight Stopped, Elon Musk's Rocket Has More Problems</h1>
            <p>SpaceX, the company owned by Elon Musk, stopped another test flight of its huge "Starship" rocket today. This happened in South Padre Island, Texas. It is the newest problem after many test flights that ended with explosions.</p>
            <p>SpaceX wrote on its social media site X, "We decided to stop the 10th Starship test flight today. We need more time to fix a problem with the ground systems." The rocket was going to fly from "Starbase" in South Texas, which is SpaceX's launch area.</p>
            <p>Reuters said that the "Super Heavy" booster, which is about 70 meters tall, and the top part of the Starship, which is about 52 meters tall, were already on the launchpad at Starbase. They were also putting fuel into them. The launch was supposed to happen at 7:35 PM US Eastern Time (7:35 AM Taiwan time on August 25).</p>
            <p>But about 30 minutes before the rocket was set to launch, SpaceX said on X that they were stopping the mission.</p>
            <p>SpaceX did not say when they would try the next test flight. However, when flights were stopped suddenly before, the problems were usually fixed in a few days.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese-Canadian MP Han Dong: Taiwan Is Important for Canada's Trade</h1>
            <p>The Canadian Parliament will start its fall meetings soon. Han Dong, a 39-year-old Member of Parliament who has Taiwanese family, said that Canada needs to deal with trade problems from the United States. It also needs to find more places to sell its goods. He believes this is a main goal for the government. Han Dong said that Taiwan is a very important part of Canada's trade plans. He will work hard to help Taiwan and Canada cooperate more and find new ways to work together.</p>
            <p>The Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, recently visited Europe to make connections stronger. Han Dong, who is part of the ruling Liberal Party, said that Carney has visited Europe four times since he became Prime Minister in March. This is because the relationship between Canada and the US changed a lot when Donald Trump was the US President. Canada is trying to talk to the US about taxes on goods, but it is also looking for more markets in other countries.</p>
            <p>He said, "Europe and Asia have very big chances for trade. People know it's not good to put all your effort into one thing. But before, Canada wasn't active enough and always depended on the US. Now, this has completely changed."</p>
            <p>As an MP with Taiwanese roots, Han Dong spoke highly of Taiwan's strong technology and trade. He said they are very important in Asia. Taiwan is a key part of Canada's plan to trade more around the world. He will work hard to help the relationship between Taiwan and Canada grow. He said, "I know both languages and cultures. I am happy to help connect both sides for practical cooperation in areas like religion, culture, education, trade, and technology."</p>
            <p>Han Dong was chosen as the MP for the Burnaby Central area in British Columbia. Burnaby City is a major place for technology in British Columbia. Important industries there include information technology, medicine, movies, new media, and clean energy.</p>
            <p>Han Dong mentioned that big Canadian companies like TELUS (for phones) and Ballard Power (for electric car batteries) are in Burnaby City. Also, famous schools like Simon Fraser University and British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) are there.</p>
            <p>He talked about his recent visit to BCIT. He saw that the school has many special research results. For example, they have new ideas in car electricity, AI robots, and ready-made houses. He believes these are very good for working with Taiwan to create business opportunities. He added, "Canada has a lot of clean energy technology and important natural resources. It can be a good friend to Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Han Dong was born in Yilan, Taiwan. When he was in the sixth grade, he moved to Canada with his family. After finishing high school in Canada, he got a law degree from a university in Australia and a business degree from a university in England. He can work as a lawyer in Canada and Australia and knows a lot about international trade laws.</p>
            <p>Even though he left Taiwan when he was young, he still keeps in touch with his family and friends there. Han Dong said, "Taiwan is always where I come from. I am happy that I grew up with the ideas and schooling from Taiwan and Canada. This is because both places truly believe in freedom, being open to everyone, and treating everyone fairly. From being a lawyer to now being an MP, I want to help make society fair, better, and peaceful."</p>
            <p>Han Dong won his first election when he decided to join politics. Many Taiwanese people living in other countries were surprised and proud. Mr. Xu Guangcheng and Ms. Lin Jiatian, who were just voters, became his volunteer supporters. Lin Jiatian said, "I went to school with him before, and I live in the same area. At first, I just wanted to help him. During the election, I saw he was very serious. He knocked on doors every day to ask for votes. Even now, when he comes back to Burnaby from Ottawa, he still goes to people's doors to say hello."</p>
            <p>Lin Jiatian also said, "Everyone knows that Taiwan's situation in the world is not easy. So, having an MP who is Taiwanese makes us feel very proud."</p>
            <p>Being an MP is a big job. It means always traveling between Ottawa and Burnaby to help the people who voted for him. It also means reading many laws and understanding how Parliament works. Parliament will start again in September, and Han Dong has a very busy schedule. He said, "During the day, I talk with people who voted for me. In the evening, I study laws and the rules of Parliament. I also find time to learn French."</p>
            <p>Canada uses both English and French as official languages. While MPs do not have to speak both languages perfectly, Han Dong, who was a very good student from a young age, wants to learn more languages. This way, he can serve the people who voted for him even better.</p>
            <p>Recently, Han Dong had a summer barbecue event where he talked with people. Many young people came to support him. Many young Taiwanese people, whose parents moved from Taiwan, said that Han Dong is an example for them. He makes them want to help their communities. They hope to also become important links between Taiwan and Canada in the future.</p>
