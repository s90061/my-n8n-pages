            <h1>Yilan Pork Supply Is Low; Agriculture Ministry Hopes for Stability by October</h1>
            <p>Yilan's supply of live pigs is low. This means that the market is expected to close for four days this week. The Ministry of Agriculture said that recently, high summer temperatures, a typhoon named Danas in July, and heavy rain have caused problems. Also, important festivals like Zhongyuan and Mid-Autumn are coming, which has made prices go up. In August, they asked Taiwan Sugar to provide 650 more pigs. They believe the supply will return to normal by October.</p>
            <p>The Yilan County Meat Business Association has almost 200 pork stalls. This week, they will close on August 14th, meaning they will be closed for four days. They will only open on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. They plan to meet again on August 15th to decide if they will close more days next week.</p>
            <p>The Central Animal Production Association tracks pig sales every day. On August 8th, 21,034 pigs were sold. The price was 111.39 New Taiwan Dollars per kilogram. On August 9th, 12,184 pigs were sold, and the price was 112.69 New Taiwan Dollars per kilogram.</p>
            <p>Zhou Zhi-xun, who is a deputy director at the Ministry of Agriculture, explained that high summer temperatures have affected how many pigs grow to full size. Also, pig diseases, rules about the environment, and the typhoon and rain in July have caused problems in some farming areas. This has made the total number of pigs available in the country smaller for a short time. Because the Zhongyuan Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival are coming, more people want to buy pork, which has made prices higher. This is a normal way for the market to work.</p>
            <p>Zhou Zhi-xun thinks that as the weather gets stable and pig farms start producing pigs normally again, the supply and prices should become normal around October. The problem of fewer pigs is happening all over the country. The Ministry of Agriculture has already started actions to help. For example, they asked Taiwan Sugar to provide 650 more pigs in August. They also asked frozen food factories to buy fewer pigs, and they have closed some markets. They also told farmers to sell their pigs in an organized way. They will continue to watch the market and make changes when needed to keep the production and sales stable.</p>
            <p>Eight years ago, Yilan County had 200,000 pigs. But as the economy changed, the number went down each year. Now, there are only 50,000 pigs raised there. Most of the pork for Yilan comes from other parts of the country. Yilan County usually needs about 350 to 380 pigs every day. Since the Dragon Boat Festival, this number has gone up to 400 pigs, and now the supply of pork is not balanced.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Yangliu Approaches; Hualien Worries About Landslide Lake and Plans Evacuation</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Yangliu is slowly moving closer to Taiwan. Hualien County Councilor Wei Chia-hsien is worried that a lake formed by a landslide in the upper part of the Mata'an River might break. The county government said they have told people to get lists of families who need help. The fire department is also making a plan for people to leave safely. They will practice this plan very soon.</p>
            <p>The weather agency said today that they will likely issue a warning for ships at sea because of Typhoon Yangliu by the morning of August 12th. Then, by evening or night, they will issue a warning for people on land. The current weather forecasts show that Yangliu's path might change a little to the north or south. But no matter which way it goes, it will affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>A lot of rain from Typhoon Wipha caused a big landslide in the national forest area at the top of Mata'an River in Wanrong Township. This landslide blocked the river and made a lake behind the landslide. The Hualien Forest Management Office looked at the lake when it was completely full of water. They think that the biggest areas that could be in danger are the Mata'an River bridge on Highway 9, buildings that protect against floods, and villages along both sides of the river further downstream.</p>
            <p>If we look at the areas by their names, the affected places include Mingli Village in Wanrong Township, Dama Village, Daping Village, and Dongfu Village in Guangfu Township. It also includes Changqiao Village, Darong Village, and Shanxing Village in Fenglin Township.</p>
            <p>Rao Zhong, who is the acting secretary-general of the Hualien County Government, told a reporter that the Forest Management Office is still checking the area upstream. The Mata'an River landslide lake is indeed bigger than it has been in recent years. They are also concerned that Typhoon Yangliu might cause the lake to overflow sooner than expected. To keep the people of Hualien safe, they need to act quickly.</p>
            <p>Rao Zhong said that seven villages downstream will be affected. He has told the three local government offices in Fenglin, Wanrong, and Guangfu to prepare lists of people who need help. They also need to count the vehicles that can be used to move people. At the same time, the fire department is creating a plan for people to leave safely. They will practice this plan soon. He also reminded all departments to "think about the worst possible situation, and prepare in the best possible way."</p>
            <p>County Councilor Wei Chia-hsien, who is not part of a main political party, said today that the landslide lake upstream of Mata'an River is as big as the Nanhua Reservoir. Information from monitoring teams shows that the lake water is only about 79 meters away from flowing over the top. Every day, 920,000 cubic meters of water fill up the lake. People first thought the lake would overflow in mid-October. However, Typhoon Yangliu might bring a lot of rain, which could make it overflow earlier.</p>
            <p>"This is a difficult type of disaster. There is not much time, things change fast, and many areas will be affected. Our old ways of preparing for disasters are not enough," said Wei Chia-hsien. He said they must do something right now. This means setting up a combined command center with both central and local governments. This will make sure that decisions and information are clear and come from one place. The Forest Management Office, the Water Resources Agency, the Fire Department, and the county government should all work together.</p>
            <p>Wei Chia-hsien also said that they need to set clear rules for when people must leave. These rules should be based on how fast the water level rises, how much the dam moves, and how much rain has fallen. If these levels are met, people must leave immediately. They also need to increase monitoring and send live video updates. This will allow the central government, the county government, and local teams to know the water level and the dam's condition at the same time. They also need to check the evacuation plan and arrange transport and shelters beforehand, to make sure people who cannot move easily can leave safely.</p>

            <h1>White House Crypto Advisor Bo Hines Leaves Job to Return to Private Work</h1>
            <p>Bo Hines, who was an advisor for digital money to US President Trump, said today that he is leaving his job. He will go back to working for a private company.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that late last month, a group of government officials led by Hines explained the Trump government's ideas for new laws about digital money. They also asked US organizations that control money to create new rules for digital money.</p>
            <p>Hines wrote on the social media platform X today: "It was a great honor to work for the Trump government and to work with our excellent AI and Crypto leader David Sacks as the head of the White House Crypto Committee."</p>
            <p>David Sacks praised Hines in his reply to Hines' post about leaving.</p>
            <p>Hines tried to become a member of the US Congress for North Carolina two times, but he did not win either time.</p>
            <p>Last month, President Trump signed a new law called the "GENIUS Act." This law aims to create rules for digital money that has a value tied to the US dollar. These are called USD stablecoins. This important new law is expected to help USD stablecoins become a common way for people to pay and move money every day.</p>
            <p>Bo Hines supported the creation of this "GENIUS Act."</p>
