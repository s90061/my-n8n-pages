            <h1>UK Foreign Secretary: China Is a Security Threat, Including Cross-Border Repression and Spying</h1>
            <p>British prosecutors recently said that a case accusing two men of spying for China would be dropped. This was because the government did not say China was a threat to national security. However, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said in an interview today that China does threaten the UK's safety.</p>
            <p>The Daily Telegraph reported that the Labour Party won the election last July. But after they took power, they did not call China a threat. This is because the Labour government's foreign office promised to work with Beijing on things like healthcare and reaching net-zero emissions.</p>
            <p>Cooper said on BBC Radio 4, "I want to be clear that we know China is a threat to UK national security. This includes stopping people from speaking freely in other countries, spying, and bad online actions. We have said this before."</p>
            <p>She also added, "Of course, they are also a trade partner. They are also an important partner in dealing with climate change. But I am very upset about this case, because I certainly wanted to see it go to court."</p>
            <p>Christopher Cash, 30, who used to be the director of the China Research Group in the UK Parliament, and Christopher Berry, 33, a teacher, were first arrested in March 2023. In April last year, they were accused of giving secret political information to Chinese intelligence officers. But both men said they were not guilty of any charges.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that British prosecutors had earlier accused these two men under the Official Secrets Act. This law says it is a crime to give any documents that might help an "enemy state" to that state.</p>
            <p>But last month, British prosecutors suddenly dropped the charges against the two men. This was just a few weeks before they were supposed to go to trial.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on October 6 that the previous government called China an "epochal challenge." They never clearly said it was an enemy state.</p>
            <p>The Conservative Party, which was in power until last year, and other opposition parties said that Starmer's Labour government intentionally stopped the trial. They did this to avoid making China angry.</p>
            <p>British prosecutors said on October 7 that they had "done everything they could" to take the case to court. But in the end, the case could not go forward because the government refused to call China an enemy state.</p>

            <p>Machado also said, "Today, if we want to achieve freedom and democracy, we need President Donald Trump, the American people, the people of Latin America, and democratic countries around the world as our main friends more than ever before."</p>

            <h1>Taishin Shin Kong Financial Urges Private Sector, Government to Work Together to Keep Nvidia in Taiwan</h1>
            <p>TAIPEI â€” Nvidia wants to build its Taiwan headquarters at the T17 and T18 sites in Beitou Shilin Technology Park. But Shin Kong Life Insurance already owns the rights to use this land. Lin Wei-chun, the general manager of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding, said today that he hopes everyone involved will stop talking through the media. He asked private companies and the Taipei City Government to sit down together. He wants them to work together to solve problems and keep Nvidia in Taiwan, because this is very important for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Nvidia plans to put its Taiwan headquarters at the T17 and T18 sites in the Beitou Shilin Technology Park. The Taipei City Government hopes to agree with Shin Kong Life to end their current contract. Then, they want to give the land use rights to Nvidia through a special plan. If not, when Shin Kong Life and Taishin Life combine in the future, they will still not agree to change or end the contract.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Government said that Shin Kong Life asked for 14 billion New Taiwan Dollars to end the contract. Wei Bao-sheng, the chairman of Shin Kong Life, said today that this number is not true. He also said that Shin Kong Life has never purposefully avoided starting construction. He hopes to work with the Taipei City Government in the spirit of their contract agreement.</p>
            <p>Lin Wei-chun, the general manager of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding, spoke to reporters tonight at the 2025 Taipei 101 National Day celebration event. He said that Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding is happy about Nvidia wanting to set up its Taiwan headquarters. He hopes that all parties involved will not talk through the media. He said that the most important thing now is for private companies and the Taipei City Government to sit down and work together to keep Nvidia. He added, "This is a very important matter for Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Lin Wei-chun further explained that the Taipei City Government is worried about giving unfair advantages, and Shin Kong Life is worried about breaking trust. To deal with these problems, he asked the central government to talk and help solve legal and responsibility issues. He wants them to work together to keep Nvidia. Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding will not make negative comments or feel negative emotions.</p>
            <p>Lin Wei-chun stressed that he hopes private companies and the government will work as partners for the good of Taiwan. He wants them to try hard to solve problems and "keep Nvidia."</p>
