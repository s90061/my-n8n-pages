            <h1>US Job Market Slows Down, Making People Think Interest Rates Will Drop; European Stocks Mostly Rise</h1>
            <p>Last week, more people in the US asked for unemployment benefits than expected. Also, a report from ADP company showed that private companies in the US hired fewer new workers in August. Investors hope this job market information means the US will lower interest rates. Because of this, most of the three big European stock markets went up today, but some went down.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 38.88 points, or 0.42%, ending at 9216.87 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up by 175.53 points, or 0.74%, closing at 23770.33 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 20.79 points, or 0.27%, ending at 7698.92 points.</p>
            <p>Now, investors are looking forward to the information the US government will release tomorrow. They hope the Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates even more.</p>

            <h1>Dongtai High School Wins Basketball Game with Comeback, Hopes for More Team Confidence</h1>
            <p>Today was the last day of the 'Climbing to the Peak' Youth Basketball Tournament for high school teams. Dongtai High School won the men's championship game against Nanhu High School with a score of 69 to 65. Coach Gao Dingguo-zhu believes this win will give the team more confidence.</p>
            <p>The big final game for high school boys in the 'Climbing to the Peak' Youth Basketball Tournament was held at the Taipei Gymnasium. Dongtai played Nanhu again. Both teams played very closely throughout the whole game. In the fourth quarter, Dongtai used its special defense, which made their opponent score only 9 points in that quarter. Also, their point guard, Quan Yi, kept the team's offense steady. In the end, Dongtai won by 4 points, taking the championship title.</p>
            <p>After the game, Dongtai coach Gao Dingguo-zhu told the Central News Agency that the last time the two teams played, it was also a very close game, but they lost. He was happy to play against Nanhu again and win. He hopes this championship will give the players more confidence and help them improve before the HBL (High School Basketball League) season starts.</p>
            <p>Regarding Quan Yi, the third-year point guard who is shorter than 170 cm, Coach Gao Dingguo-zhu said that Quan Yi did not do well enough at the end of the last game against Nanhu. But today, at important moments, he handled the ball well, showing he has grown. 'I have high expectations for him. I expect him to control the game on the court, and even if he is shorter, he needs to find a way to stand out more than others,' the coach said.</p>
            <p>In this game, Xu En-xiang, a second-year forward from Dongtai, scored the most points for the team with 22, and also got 14 rebounds. Quan Yi had a great all-around performance with 14 points, 5 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals. Xu En-xiang felt he did not play well in the earlier games. Today, he followed the coaches' instructions and attacked the basket without thinking too much before shooting.</p>
