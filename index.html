            <h1>Legislature Parties Agree: Extra Funds for Local Governments After Budget Passes</h1>
            <p>On the evening of August 28th, leaders from different political parties in the Legislative Yuan met. They discussed an extra budget for the central government. Fu Kun-chi, who leads the Kuomintang party, suggested that after the extra budget bill passes, money should be given to local governments right away. Leaders from the Democratic Progressive Party, who usually disagree, signed this agreement today.</p>
            <p>The Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan met today to look at the extra budget for 2025. They decided to remove about 1.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars in the first round. At 8 PM, Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu brought the parties together to discuss proposals from the committee and party groups.</p>
            <p>The first topic was the extra 429.06 million New Taiwan Dollars for media promotion. Both the Kuomintang and Taiwan People's Party wanted to cut all of it. However, Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chung Chia-pin said that 102.28 million New Taiwan Dollars of this was for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote Taiwan internationally. This also included promotion for National Day and New Year's Eve fireworks. He hoped they could cut only 50 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained how the money would be used, but Kuomintang legislator Wang Hung-wei still had doubts. She questioned if the money would be used by foreign media. Since they could not agree, Speaker Han Kuo-yu decided to put this matter aside. He said he would call another meeting tomorrow after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides information about any foreign media or channels they plan to work with.</p>
            <p>Then, Fu Kun-chi, the leader of the Kuomintang party, changed the topic. He said they were discussing the extra budget today because the government wrongly cut 63.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars from general subsidies for local areas. Later, the government added other items, making the total 87.8 billion New Taiwan Dollars. After the big recall election, all parties should work together for the country. But the government still hinted that it would not give back the general subsidies and might even make local governments apply for them. Fu asked, "Do we need to make things so difficult?"</p>
            <p>Fu Kun-chi also presented the agreement. He said that only Ker Chien-ming knew about the need for harmony among parties, and Ker had already signed it. But other party leaders had not. Fu warned that if the Democratic Progressive Party still held local cities and counties hostage, the Kuomintang party would never stop opposing the government.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, the leader of the Taiwan People's Party, used a comparison. He said the Executive Yuan was like a kidnapper asking for ransom. They would pay the ransom to save the children, but that does not mean they would not hold the kidnappers legally and politically responsible.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao, the chief secretary of the Democratic Progressive Party, said that the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has rules for how they work. She hoped the wording of the agreement could be made more exact. She told Fu Kun-chi that the Democratic Progressive Party was not against it. She added, "That is too big of a label; we cannot wear it." She hoped they would not make the discussions difficult because of the general subsidies.</p>
            <p>After a short break, the leaders of all parties signed the agreement one by one. Fu Kun-chi said that even though Ker Chien-ming was willing to sign the agreement, he was worried that Ker might be recalled tomorrow, which would make the agreement invalid. That is why he asked all three party leaders to sign to be sure. In the end, all party leaders signed the agreement about general subsidies for local governments.</p>
            <p>The agreement said that when President Lai Ching-te was the mayor of Tainan, he said the central government should not keep all the power and money. It also stated that the Executive Yuan should not wrongly change the meaning of rules. Even though the total amount of money for local governments would stay the same, the Executive Yuan tried to decide how much each city and county would get. It even tried to change next year's general subsidies into an application system. This goes against what Lai Ching-te said when he was mayor of Tainan.</p>
            <p>The agreement also stated that for the 2025 extra budget, general subsidies for local areas must not be less than last year's budget. The Executive Yuan should give the extra general subsidies to local governments right after the extra budget passes its third reading. This is to avoid delays in government work.</p>
            <p>In addition, for the part of the extra budget managed by the Executive Yuan, after many talks between the parties, Han Kuo-yu decided to keep 2.368 billion New Taiwan Dollars for forest conservation payments and another 400 million New Taiwan Dollars. For the cut parts, all proposals from the Taiwan People's Party were accepted. This also included the Kuomintang party's suggestions to cut 1.879 million New Taiwan Dollars from special expenses, 25.568 million New Taiwan Dollars from joint service operations, and 1.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars from the Central Election Commission.</p>

            <h1>Taipower Hopes Parliament Supports Special Law for Resilience to Strengthen Power for Science Parks</h1>
            <p>The government recently set aside 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars in a special law for resilience. This money is to make the power supply stronger for science and industrial parks. Taipower said on the evening of August 28th that because of changes like US tariff policies, they will improve the power supply for important industrial areas like science parks. They hope that parliament will support this special law to strengthen the power system budget.</p>
            <p>The government's special law for disaster recovery has given Taipower 10.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This money is for fixing things and making main power lines along the coast stronger after typhoons. Another 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars is in the special law for economic, social, and national security resilience. This money is to make sure that science and industrial parks in northern, central, and southern Taiwan have a stable power supply and to improve the power equipment they need. Both of these budgets are currently being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan.</p>
            <p>Taipower released a statement tonight, saying that a stable power supply needs not only enough power sources but also good power grid construction. To deal with international changes, industries want to make sure their power supply is stable. So, the government changed the "Special Law for Strengthening Economic, Social, and National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations." It added a part about making the power system stronger. By doing this, they aim to make the power supply for science and industrial parks more resilient, ensuring a stable power system for industries.</p>
            <p>Taipower emphasized that having a stable power supply should be something everyone agrees on. This budget is very important for stable power supply in all parks across Taiwan, including the Taipei Neihu Technology Park. They hope that everyone and parliament will support the government's budget plans. This will help Taipower continue to invest in making the power system stronger.</p>
            <p>In response to international changes, such as US tariff policies, Taipower said they plan to improve "the quality and reliability of the transmission grid's power supply." They will focus on important industrial areas like science and industrial parks to make their overall power supply more resilient.</p>
            <p>Also, this includes "improving the disaster resistance of transmission and distribution lines" by moving lines in areas not affected by disasters, and "improving transmission and distribution repair" projects. The total cost for these projects is about 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Taipower stressed that in 2022, to prevent another large-scale power outage and prepare for net-zero emissions, they started the "Power Grid Resilience Improvement Plan." This plan involves investing over 500 billion New Taiwan Dollars in 10 years to make the power grid more spread out, stronger, and better protected. This is a complete upgrade for the current power grid system.</p>
            <p>Taipower explained that the main goal is to strengthen the country's high-voltage power grid step by step, making it more spread out and increasing the stability of equipment. This will improve the overall resilience of the power grid and build a distributed power grid. This budget is set by Taipower itself, and its goals and tasks are different from those in the special law mentioned earlier.</p>
            <p>Taipower stated that they will work faster to strengthen the power grid and improve the system's resilience. This will ensure stable power supply and help with the net-zero transition. However, all these projects need money. Taipower has covered 600 billion New Taiwan Dollars in electricity price differences caused by the war between Russia and Ukraine over the past three years. To keep improving the power supply's resilience and achieve a strong power grid, they hope everyone will support these budgets.</p>

            <h1>Hsieh Chih-wei Becomes Taiwan's Representative to the EU: "Very Apprehensive But Will Do My Best"</h1>
            <p>The Presidential Office announced today that Hsieh Chih-wei, who used to be Taiwan's representative to Germany, has been appointed as Taiwan's representative to the European Union and Belgium. Hsieh Chih-wei wrote on social media that he feels very nervous but will, as always, do his best.</p>
            <p>On the evening of August 28th, Hsieh Chih-wei posted on Facebook. He said that a friend messaged him to say that the presidential order for his new role in Belgium had been released. He replied to his friend, "I am very nervous." Looking back at his nine years in Germany, he said that he worked with the office to help German politicians and society understand. He explained that having cultural connections between Taiwan and Germany, based on shared values, and working together on technology, and jointly protecting Taiwan's freedom and democracy, was definitely good for them.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Chih-wei stressed that while the work is important, the timing is even more key. If you compare things, it's not just about what is good, but also about the right time. At this moment, following the President's order, he will continue to do his best as always.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Chih-wei also said that working for Taiwan in foreign affairs seems to be a choice between two things: either being given an important new role, or being used in a different important way, or both.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Chih-wei has a bachelor's degree in German from Soochow University and a Ph.D. in German literature from Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum in Germany. After finishing his studies, he returned to teach in the German department at Soochow University. He helped start groups like the Taiwan Professors Association and Taiwan North Society. In May 2005, he became Taiwan's representative to Germany for the first time.</p>
            <p>In 2007, Hsieh Chih-wei became the Director-General of the Government Information Office. Then, in August 2016, he again became the representative to Germany, a position he held until August 2025.</p>
