            <h1>India and China Start to Fix Their Relationship, but Experts Say It Might Only Be a Small Improvement</h1>
            <p>India and China are trying to build their relationship again. This comes after the United States put high taxes on goods from India. Today, the South China Morning Post reported that many experts on India and China believe any improvement in their relationship will be small. This is because both countries do not trust each other. They think it might only be a "cold peace." This means they will not fight, but they also will not be very friendly.</p>
            <p>The report says that the relationship between India and China seems to be starting a new chapter. This is happening after China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited New Delhi for the first time in three years. They are making new agreements about borders, starting direct flights again, and working more closely on money and trade.</p>
            <p>At the end of August, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will go to Tianjin for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting. This is his first visit to China in seven years. He will meet with China's President Xi Jinping. This meeting might help to make the relationship between the two countries even better.</p>
            <p>During Wang Yi's two-day visit to New Delhi this week, both sides agreed to start talks about their borders in the eastern and central areas. Also, since a deadly fight between Indian and Chinese soldiers happened in the Galwan Valley in 2020, they have been talking about the border in the western Himalayas.</p>
            <p>Indian news also reported that China has allowed rare earth minerals to be sent to India. This is important because rare earth minerals are very important in the trade disagreement between China and the United States.</p>
            <p>Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King's College London, said that New Delhi and Beijing are talking for many reasons. He said, "Both sides want to improve or make their relationship normal again, because their relationship became very difficult after the border problems."</p>
            <p>However, Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior researcher at Chatham House in London who studies South Asia, thinks this might be a "cold peace."</p>
            <p>Bajpaee said, "This means there is unlikely to be a big fight, but a lasting friendship is also unlikely." He added that for India and China to work more closely, they need to solve the basic disagreements between them.</p>
            <p>He Xianqing, an assistant researcher at China's National Institute for South China Sea Studies, shared a similar idea. He pointed out that India and China still have disagreements about their borders. They also compete in the Indo-Pacific area and the Global South. The two countries have many shared interests, so their relationship will surely face challenges in the future.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that in recent years, before trade became worse, India also made its relationship with the United States stronger. Also, India has worked more with the Philippines. The Philippines often has problems with China over land in the South China Sea. New Delhi is also worried about China's growing power in South Asia.</p>
            <p>The report said that taxes from Washington are a main reason why India and China are restarting their relationship. The United States put an extra 25% tax on goods from India. From August 27th, the total extra tax will be 50%. This is because India keeps buying oil from Russia. Last week, the United States also worked more closely with Pakistan, India's rival, on safety and fighting terrorism.</p>
            <p>Lin Minwang, who is a deputy head at Fudan University's Institute of International Studies and deputy director of the South Asia Research Center in Shanghai, thinks that improvements in the India-China relationship will be very small. He expects that Beijing might be careful about New Delhi's "opportunistic" actions in the competition between China and the United States.</p>
            <p>He added, "Modi and his government are still very much in favor of the United States. Their feelings against China are very strong."</p>
            <p>He Xianqing also said that India might "use China to get better deals with the United States."</p>
            <p>The report also said that for New Delhi, the close relationship between Beijing and Islamabad is still a problem. China's increasing influence in South Asia is also a challenge.</p>
            <p>After visiting India this week, Wang Yi also visited Afghanistan and Pakistan. He met with the foreign ministers of both countries. China promised to keep working with these two countries, especially through the "China-Pakistan Economic Corridor," which costs billions of dollars. India is against this plan because of its long-standing disagreement with Pakistan over the Kashmir area.</p>
            <p>Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, a senior researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), said that Pakistan is "not just an outside factor." China works with Pakistan against India. So, for New Delhi's foreign and safety policies, India must always think about the cooperation between China and Pakistan.</p>
            <p>She mentioned that Beijing has given Islamabad "more and more advanced military tools." She added, "Right now, both India and China choose to ignore this problem. But this cannot last, especially when the relationship between India and Pakistan is still not stable."</p>
            <p>However, Lin Minwang said that India and China have many chances to work together on global, money, and regional issues. He said, "Fighting is not certain." He Xianqing also said that talking openly is key to keeping the relationship moving forward. He added, "It is normal to have disagreements, but specific problems should not stop the overall progress of the two countries' relationship."</p>

            <h1>Apple Releases Short Film About People with Shaky Hands and How They Use iPhones to Record Their Lives</h1>
            <p>Apple always cares about making its products easy for everyone to use. On iPhones and other devices, you can find special features for people who cannot see or hear well. Today, Apple released a short film called "No Frame Missed." It tells the stories of people with Parkinson's disease. The film shows how iPhone's action mode and other special features help people whose hands shake to record their lives.</p>
            <p>The director, Renato Amoroso, made this short film (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEalzEnT70k). It follows four people with Parkinson's disease. It shows how they use the iPhone 16 Pro's action mode and voice control to film steady videos. The film also shows other iPhone features that help people, like voice control, touch settings, and the "Medications" feature in the Health App.</p>
            <p>In the film, a filmmaker named Brett stopped filming little by little after he learned he had Parkinson's disease at age 37. But he used the iPhone's action mode to record a very important moment: his son's first time riding a bicycle.</p>
            <p>Also, Google announced today that its new Pixel 10 phones will be available in Taiwan. They showed a special feature called "Guided Frame" for people who cannot see well. When the camera sees what you want to film, the phone tells you by voice and vibration how to take the picture.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Wins Big Against the Philippines 10-0 in U15 Asian Youth Baseball, Will Play Japan for a Spot in the Championship Game</h1>
            <p>The second round of the U15 Asian Youth Baseball Championship started today. Taiwan's team hit 12 times in the game. Wen Yi-en hit three times very well. Also, two of Taiwan's pitchers did not let the other team score any runs. In the end, Taiwan won against the Philippines with a score of 10 to 0 before the game was finished. This was their first win in this round. Tomorrow, they will play against Japan and try hard to win.</p>
            <p>The Asian Youth Baseball Championship is happening at the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center. Taiwan's team moved to the next round by finishing second in their group. They had one loss before today. Today, they played their first game in this round against the Philippines.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the game, Taiwan's team started scoring runs. Wen Yi-en hit a ball that allowed him to get to third base. Then, Tseng Yi-che hit the ball, and one run was scored. In the second part, Chen Rui-hsin hit the ball and then quickly ran to second base. Yeh Hsing-fu and Sun Jun-yen then hit the ball one after another, each getting one run for the team. The other team made a mistake, giving Taiwan another run. Tseng Yi-che then hit the ball again, getting one more run. Taiwan's team was ahead by 5 to 0.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team scored two runs in the third part of the game and one more run in the fourth part. In the sixth part, Taiwan scored one run, and then Wen Yi-en hit a ball that got another run. This helped the team win against the Philippines with a score of 10 to 0 in the sixth part, ending the game early. Right now, Taiwan's team has one win and one loss in this round. Tomorrow evening, there will be a very important game against Japan. This game will decide who goes to the championship game.</p>
            <p>The first pitcher for Taiwan, Chao Sheng-hao, threw 53 balls in 4.2 innings. He only allowed two hits and struck out eight players. He did not let the other team score any runs. After him, Kao Pin-han pitched for 1.1 innings. He did not let any hits or runs happen.</p>
            <p>After the game, the head coach, Chiu Yao-yu, said, "Today, I told the players that when there are players on base, they should not try to hit a very long ball. They should hit the ball cleanly. I also told everyone to play until the very end and not to relax." When talking about the big game against Japan tomorrow, Chiu Yao-yu said, "Of course, our best pitcher will play tomorrow. I told the players to stay calm and not be nervous. If they play freely, it should be fine."</p>
            <p>The starting pitcher, Chao Sheng-hao, said that today he was able to control every ball and throw it to the right spot, which made it hard for the other team to hit. Today, he threw the ball as fast as 135 kilometers per hour. He said, "I want to gain more weight in my senior year of high school to make my throwing speed faster." About tomorrow's game, Chao Sheng-hao said, "Everyone is doing well right now. If we keep it up, we can definitely win."</p>
