            <h1>After Gaza Ceasefire, What About Russia and Ukraine? Europe Hopes Trump Continues Efforts</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 13 (Central News Agency) â€“ U.S. President Trump helped to make a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza happen. Now, Europe hopes he can use the same methods to help with the war between Russia and Ukraine. They want him to pressure Russia to join peace talks. However, experts are worried that Trump might reach an agreement with Russia and then make Kyiv accept it, which might not be good for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Today, President Trump met with over 20 leaders from different countries in Egypt. They signed a peace agreement for Gaza. The Wall Street Journal reported that officials who know about Trump's plans said that after this "diplomatic victory trip" in the Middle East, Trump will meet with Ukrainian President Zelensky at the White House on October 17. During his quick visits to Israel and Egypt, Trump said many times that while he was solving the conflict between Israel and Palestine, he also wanted to end the other war.</p>
            <p>High-ranking officials from the U.S. and Europe have warned that neither Russia nor Ukraine will change their plans just because Trump had some early success in the Middle East peace talks. Also, it is still not clear if there will be long-term peace in Gaza.</p>
            <p>But European officials said that "pressure" is the only lesson Trump should learn from the Israel-Hamas ceasefire that can be used for the Russia-Ukraine war. So far, Trump has not put as much pressure on Russian President Putin as he did on Hamas. Ukraine and Europe hope this will change, especially since Trump has seen his success as a "master negotiator" in the Middle East. Trump himself is also becoming more impatient with Russia.</p>
            <p>Trump has put high taxes on goods from India, which is a main trading partner of Russia. But he has not yet put strong new sanctions or indirect sanctions on Russia. European officials say that stronger financial punishments on Russia are very important at this stage of the war.</p>
            <p>Ukraine is also asking Trump for Tomahawk cruise missiles. These missiles can travel about 2500 kilometers. This would allow Kyiv to attack targets deep inside Russia with more power than their current long-range drones.</p>
            <p>Trump has not promised to do this yet. But on the evening of October 12, while flying to the Middle East, he talked about Putin. He said he might tell Putin, "Listen, if the war doesn't end, I will send Tomahawk missiles (to Ukraine)."</p>
            <p>Axios news website reported that two sources familiar with the plans said Trump and Zelensky will talk about giving Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine at the White House on October 17.</p>
            <p>Franz-Stefan Gady, a defense expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Vienna, said that the Kremlin's strong military power means Trump has few ways to force Russia to return to peace talks.</p>
            <p>Gady said, "Russia having nuclear weapons will always be a key thing to think about before putting any pressure. The United States has not yet shown that it is ready to make the situation worse."</p>
            <p>Gady believes it is more likely that Trump will talk directly with Putin to make a ceasefire agreement. Then he would try to make Zelensky sign it. This is what Europe is most worried about and has been trying to stop.</p>
            <p>He said that this fits Trump's usual loud and one-sided way of doing foreign policy. Trump would not hesitate to pressure Zelensky to accept an agreement that does not fully help Europe and Ukraine.</p>

            <p>The director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, Lu Fei-li, explained that the city started collecting stories from former American soldiers and their families in 2021. They visited the U.S. three times to gather these memories. They also worked with different organizations and received help from people in Taiwan and the U.S. This teamwork helped them successfully gather many stories.</p>

They hope this will help more people learn about this part of Taichung's history. This history includes both good times and sad times. The English version of "Footsteps of Splendor" will help people around the world understand this special history of Taichung.</p>
            <p>The city government said that Taichung's history with the U.S. military is unique. This is especially true for the area around Tunghai University. The book helps show this unique historical memory. The English version will help more people learn about this important part of Taichung's past.</p>

            <h1>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Time in Office Extended, Expected to Last Longer Than Yoshihide Suga's</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, October 14 (Central News Agency) â€“ Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's time in office will be longer than first thought. This means he might serve longer than former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. Suga was in office for 384 days.</p>
            <p>Ishiba became Prime Minister on October 1, 2024. He was supposed to hold his position until the end of his term as head of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in September 2027. However, on October 14, the LDP decided to change its rules. They removed the limit on how many times a person can be the party's leader. This change means that Ishiba can now stay on as Prime Minister for longer than originally planned.</p>
            <p>This decision was made at a meeting of the LDP's general council. All members agreed to the change. The change means that Ishiba will be able to serve more than one term as party leader. Before this, the rule was that a person could only be the LDP leader for three terms, or nine years in total.</p>
            <p>The LDP explained that removing the term limits will help the party be more stable. It will also allow leaders to stay in power longer if they are doing a good job. This is especially important for dealing with big national and international issues.</p>
            <p>Ishiba has said that he will continue to work hard for Japan. He mentioned that he wants to focus on fixing the economy and making Japan stronger on the world stage. He also thanked the party members for their support.</p>
            <p>Some people are happy about the change, saying it will bring more consistency in leadership. Others are worried that it might lead to less change and new ideas in the party. However, for now, Ishiba is set to be one of Japan's longer-serving prime ministers.</p>
