Tesla's first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations, mainly because the company lowered prices significantly to boost sales. While revenue increased, profit margins took a hit. This highlights the challenge Tesla faces in balancing growth and profitability as competition in the electric vehicle market intensifies.

The company's CEO, Elon Musk, acknowledged the pressure on profit margins but emphasized Tesla's focus on long-term growth and market share. He stated that further price adjustments might be necessary to stay competitive. Investors are now closely watching how Tesla will navigate this challenging period, balancing its ambitious growth targets with maintaining healthy financial performance. The results have led to some uncertainty in the stock market.

**Article 2: Innovation - Scientists Develop New Material That Can Heal Itself**

Researchers have created a new type of polymer that can repair itself when damaged. This innovative material contains special chemical bonds that can break and reform, allowing the material to "heal" cracks and scratches. The potential applications are vast, ranging from self-healing phone screens to more durable infrastructure.

The team demonstrated the material's self-healing capabilities by cutting it and then observing it re-bond over time. While further development is needed to scale up production and improve the material's properties, this breakthrough represents a significant step forward in materials science. It promises to create products that last longer and require less maintenance, ultimately reducing waste and saving resources.

**Article 3: Travel - New Zealand Scraps All Remaining COVID-19 Travel Restrictions**

New Zealand has lifted all remaining COVID-19-related travel restrictions, marking a return to pre-pandemic travel norms. Travelers no longer need to provide proof of vaccination, undergo pre-departure testing, or complete any quarantine requirements upon arrival. This move is expected to boost tourism and reconnect New Zealand with the rest of the world.

The decision reflects the country's high vaccination rates and successful management of the pandemic. Tourism operators are optimistic about the future, anticipating a surge in international visitors. The government hopes that this change will revitalize the economy and further cement New Zealand's reputation as a desirable travel destination.
