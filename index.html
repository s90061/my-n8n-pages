            <h1>Songshan Airport Viewing Platform is Ready, Will Open on October 4th</h1>
            <p>Songshan Airport's viewing platform has been closed for almost two years for repairs. It is now finished. The Civil Aeronautics Administration said today that it will open again on October 4th for visitors.</p>
            <p>The repairs took almost two years. Now it is ready. They added a wall with mascots and a very big wall with plants, which are good places for photos. The Minister of Transportation, Chen Shih-kai, said this morning that it will be open to the public during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.</p>
            <p>The Civil Aeronautics Administration announced that the Songshan Airport viewing platform will open on the 4th. Zheng Jian-zhong, who is the head of Taipei International Airport Station, said they will check all the things at the viewing platform in the next two days. It will open on October 4th, which is the first day of the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. It will be open every day from 9 AM to 9 PM.</p>
            <p>Zheng Jian-zhong said that the viewing platform first opened in 2011. It quickly became a popular place in northern Taiwan to watch airplanes. More than 450,000 people visited it in one year, which was a record.</p>
            <p>The newly fixed viewing platform now has two new chipmunk mascots, 'Song Sang' and 'Ai Jiang'. These are in addition to the original Songshan Airport mascot, 'Lu Cheng Cheng'. There is also a 3D painted wall with the mascots, where visitors can take pictures. Next to it, there is a very large plant wall. It is about 16 meters long and 3.5 meters high. It has mountain shapes, smooth stones, and seats that look like clouds. This makes you think of planes flying high in the sky.</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Checks Indoor Air Quality, Two Stores Found to be Not Good</h1>
            <p>To keep people healthy, the Taipei City Environmental Protection Department checked the air quality inside 14 large stores. They found that Beitou Costco and Carrefour Chongqing store had too much carbon dioxide. These stores must fix the problem by a certain time. If they don't, they will pay a fine of NT$50,000 to NT$250,000.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Environmental Protection Department said today that many people gather in large stores. This can cause the amount of carbon dioxide to be too high. Too much carbon dioxide can make it hard to breathe. It can also cause headaches, make you sleepy, slow your reactions, and make you feel tired.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department said that from August to September, they checked the air in 14 large stores. This was to make sure people could shop safely. They found that Beitou Costco and Carrefour Chongqing store had too much carbon dioxide. The stores must improve the air by bringing in more fresh air, making ventilation better, or letting fewer people in at one time.</p>
            <p>During the time they are fixing the problem, the stores must put a sign at the entrance to show that they failed the check. If the air quality is still not good when they check again, the stores will pay a fine of NT$50,000 to NT$250,000.</p>
