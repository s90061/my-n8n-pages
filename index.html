            <h1>US Stocks Stay Stable After Inflation Data</h1>
            <p>The US stock market was falling in the morning today. But by the end of the day, it was mostly flat. This happened after people thought about the inflation numbers, which were not as good as expected. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for July was much higher than people thought it would be. This makes it harder to guess if the Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates soon.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went down by 11.01 points, which is 0.02%. It closed at 44911.26 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index went up by 1.96 points, or 0.03%. It closed at 6468.54 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index went down by 2.47 points, or 0.01%. It closed at 21710.67 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went down by 7.12 points, or 0.12%. It closed at 5885.49 points.</p>

            <h1>Sudden Heavy Rain in Kashmir, India, Causes 46 Deaths and Over 200 Missing</h1>
            <p>Officials in India said today that heavy rain suddenly fell in the Kashmir area. This caused at least 46 people to die and more than 200 people to go missing. This is the second such disaster in the Himalayan mountains in just over a week.</p>
            <p>The event happened in Chasoti town in the Kishtwar area. This small town is a stop on a popular religious journey. Just over a week ago, a bad flood and mudslide covered an entire village in Uttarakhand, which is also in the Himalayan mountains.</p>
            <p>An official said that during this event, the flood washed away the village's security post and community kitchen. This post was on the way to the Machail Mata temple, a holy place.</p>
            <p>The official said, "Many pilgrims were gathered there to eat lunch, and sadly, the flood swept them away."</p>
            <p>The Machail yatra (Machail pilgrimage) is a popular trip to the Machail Mata temple, which is high up in the Himalayan mountains. Machail Mata is one of the forms of the Hindu goddess Durga. Because cars can only go as far as Chasoti town, pilgrims have to walk from Chasoti to the temple.</p>
            <p>TV pictures showed pilgrims crying in fear as the flood covered the village.</p>
            <p>Ramesh Kumar, a leader in the Kishtwar area, told ANI news agency that the event happened at 11:30 AM local time. Local police and rescue officials have already arrived at the place.</p>
            <p>Kumar said, "Army and Air Force groups have also been sent. Search and rescue work is happening now."</p>
            <p>According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), heavy rain means more than 100 millimeters of rain falls suddenly in just one hour. This kind of rain can cause sudden floods, landslides, and other problems, especially in mountain areas during the monsoon season.</p>
            <p>The local weather office in Srinagar said that many areas in Kashmir, including Kishtwar, will have heavy rain today. This could cause mudslides and flash floods. The weather office has asked people living there to stay away from buildings that are not strong, electricity poles, and old trees.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Rise Sharply as Market Focuses on Trump-Putin Meeting and US Interest Rate Cut Outlook</h1>
            <p>Oil prices went up a lot today, about 2%, reaching their highest point in a week. This happened because US President Trump warned that if his talks with Russian President Putin about the war in Ukraine fail, there will be "serious consequences." Also, people in the market think that the US might lower interest rates next month. This could make people want to buy more oil.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures went up by 1.21 US dollars, or 1.8%. They closed at 66.84 US dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil went up strongly by 1.31 US dollars, or 2.1%. It closed at 63.96 US dollars.</p>
