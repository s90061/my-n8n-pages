            <h1>Fox News Host Says "Bomb the UN" After Trump's Problem, UN Says He Said Sorry Privately</h1>
            <p>On September 26, in New York, a Fox News TV host named Jesse Watters said people should bomb the United Nations building. This happened after former US President Trump had problems with a teleprompter and an escalator at the UN headquarters. A UN spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, said today that the UN was shocked by these words.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Mr. Dujarric said the UN talked to Fox News about what Mr. Watters said on his show on September 23. After this, Mr. Watters privately said sorry to Melissa Fleming, who is the UN's Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications.</p>
            <p>Fox News has not said anything about this yet.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dujarric told reporters today, "Saying we should bomb, use gas on, or destroy this building is not funny or a joke. We cannot accept such comments."</p>
            <p>Mr. Watters made these comments about bombing the UN when he was talking about Trump's speech to world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York on September 23. Before this, Trump had complained that an escalator at the UN headquarters stopped suddenly after he got on it, and his teleprompter also did not work.</p>
            <p>Mr. Watters said, "We should either leave the UN or bomb it. Maybe use gas on it... We must destroy it."</p>
            <p>The UN explained that the escalator carrying Trump and his wife, Melania, stopped suddenly possibly because a White House photographer accidentally pressed a safety button. About the teleprompter not working, UN officials said that the White House was operating it at that time.</p>

            <h1>US Supreme Court Allows Trump Government to Stop $4 Billion in Foreign Aid</h1>
            <p>On September 26, in Washington, the US Supreme Court agreed with President Trump's government again. The court said the government can stop about 4 billion US dollars (about 120 billion New Taiwan dollars) in foreign aid. Congress had approved this money for the current financial year. This decision helps President Trump's "America First" policy.</p>
            <p>The US government's financial year for 2025 ends on September 30. The 4 billion US dollars in aid money was set aside by Congress for things like helping other countries, UN peacekeeping, and promoting democracy abroad.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this case makes people wonder how much power a president has to cancel money that Congress has approved but that the president does not agree with. The US Constitution clearly states that Congress controls money matters.</p>
            <p>Aid groups had sued earlier. They questioned the Trump government's choice to stop the foreign aid money. After that, Judge Amir Ali from a federal court in Washington asked the Trump government to quickly spend the money. But today, the Supreme Court approved a request from the Justice Department, stopping Judge Ali's order.</p>
            <p>Right now, there are 6 conservative judges and 3 liberal judges on the Supreme Court. This year, the Trump government has asked the Supreme Court many times to step in. They wanted the court to allow Trump's policies to happen when lower courts had stopped them. Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the Supreme Court has mostly supported the government in almost all the cases it has reviewed.</p>
            <p>Today, in an unsigned order, the Supreme Court said that the aid groups might not have the legal right to challenge the decision. The court also worried that if they decided against Trump now, it could make his power to lead foreign affairs weaker.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Supreme Court said this urgent order is not the final decision on the case itself. However, it allows the money to be stopped for now while the case continues in lower courts.</p>
            <p>Three liberal judges disagreed today. They believe this decision challenges the US government's rule of having three separate powers: executive, legislative, and judicial. They pointed out that the Constitution "gives Congress the power to decide how money is spent by making appropriation laws."</p>

            <h1>Singer Usay Kawlu Thinks of Hualien Disaster Victims During India Show, Asks for Strong Spirit</h1>
            <p>On September 27, in New Delhi, reporter Li Jin-wei reported that a lake formed by a landslide, called a "landslide dam lake," in Mata'an Stream in Hualien overflowed and caused a disaster. Usay Kawlu, a singer who won a Golden Melody award, was performing in India. She was thinking about the people affected by the disaster in Hualien. She hopes everyone can be strong, like the "tree bean," which is the meaning of Mata'an.</p>
            <p>This year marks 30 years since Taiwan and India started their representative offices. With help from the Ministry of Culture and Taiwan's office in India, "The 2025 Taiwan Indigenous Music Night" took place on the evening of September 26 at The Piano Man Jazz Club in New Delhi. Usay Kawlu and well-known musician Musa gave a wonderful music show to the audience.</p>
            <p>Usay Kawlu, who is from Hualien, said that Hualien is where she grew up. Her music also comes from Hualien. Even though she moved to other places when she grew up, she feels like she gets new energy every time she goes back to Hualien.</p>
            <p>Hualien has been hit by typhoons and heavy rain. On September 23, the landslide dam lake in Mata'an Stream overflowed again, causing serious damage in the area. Usay Kawlu is currently in India, but she is worried about her family, friends, and all the people affected in Hualien.</p>
            <p>When Usay Kawlu talked to a CNA reporter, she said that when the news came out, she was recording a TV show. At that time, she heard it was very serious. "The videos I saw showed the water was as high as one floor," she said. So, she quickly called her family.</p>
            <p>Usay Kawlu said that some of her family members cannot move easily, and they had to be carried to the second floor. "So, I was very emotional at that moment, and my hands kept shaking," she said. Because many of her family live in seriously affected areas, she quickly contacted everyone. Luckily, everyone was safe.</p>
            <p>Usay Kawlu said that many homes will need to be repaired. This will need help from many different people. Now, people are already in Hualien helping with the rescue work. She is very thankful and wants to go back to Hualien to see what happened as soon as her performance is finished.</p>
            <p>For the people in the disaster area, Usay Kawlu hopes to encourage everyone using the name of the place, "Mata'an."</p>
            <p>Usay Kawlu told the CNA reporter that Mata'an is an Amis word. Its original meaning is "tree bean." Tree beans can grow very well and are also very strong. "So, I hope everyone can be as strong as Mata'an. Let's work hard together," she said.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Vajra badly hit Hualien. As of 7 AM on September 26, the Mata'an Stream landslide dam lake overflowing had caused 14 deaths and 11 people were still missing.</p>
