            <h1>Modi Visits Japan: India and Japan Will Shape Asia's Future</h1>
            <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Tokyo today. He said that India and Japan will "shape the Asian century." Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba promised to invest 10 trillion Japanese Yen, which is about 2 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, in India.</p>
            <p>Modi spoke at a business meeting in Tokyo. He said, "The friendship between India and Japan is important and smart. It is based on good business reasons. We have made our shared interests into shared wealth."</p>
            <p>He added, "India is a starting point for Japanese companies that want to go to the Global South. We will create a stable, developing, and rich Asian century."</p>
            <p>Right now, the two countries trade more than 20 billion US dollars every year. Japan usually sells more goods to India.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru said, "Japan and India are important partners. We share common ideas like freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. We have had a good friendship and trust for many years."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Our business relationship is growing fast. Japan's technology and India's smart people and big market work well together."</p>
            <p>Both Japan and India are currently facing problems because of new taxes from US President Trump. Many Indian goods now have taxes as high as 50%, which started this week.</p>
            <p>Japan will invest in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and computer chips in India. The two countries will also work together on important minerals. The two leaders plan to visit a chip factory tomorrow.</p>
            <p>They will also visit a factory that makes Shinkansen bullet trains. With help from Japan, they plan to build a 7000-kilometer-long high-speed rail system in India by 2047. This year will be 100 years since India became independent.</p>
            <p>After his trip to Japan, Prime Minister Modi will go to China. He will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit on August 31st and September 1st. Chinese President Xi Jinping will be in charge of the meeting. Leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin will also be there.</p>
            <p>This will be Modi's first visit to China since 2018.</p>

            <h1>Hawks Score 6 Runs in One Inning, Win Game and Get 4th Straight Victory</h1>
            <p>Today, a baseball game was played at Chengching Lake Baseball Stadium in Taiwan. The TSG Hawks were losing at one point, but they kept scoring runs. In the bottom of the 6th inning, Wang Boxuan hit a key single that brought in two runs, changing the score. The Hawks scored six runs in that one inning. In the end, the Hawks won the game 10 to 5 against the Rakuten Monkeys. This was the Hawks' fourth win in a row.</p>
            <p>In the second inning, the Monkeys had runners on second and third base. Lin Ziwei hit a ground ball, and one run scored. Then, Lin Zhenghua hit a short hit into the field, and another run scored. In the fourth inning, Zhang Minxun hit a single. He then moved to third base because of other plays and a wild throw. Lin Zhenghua then hit another single, scoring one run. In the bottom of the fifth inning, the Hawks got two free walks, putting players on first and second base. Zeng Ziyou then hit a double, scoring two runs, making the Hawks only one run behind.</p>
            <p>In the top of the sixth inning, Lin Zhenghua from the Monkeys hit another single, scoring one run. But in the bottom of the sixth, the Hawks started to score a lot of runs. Zhang Zhaoyuan hit a home run, scoring one run by himself. Then, with all bases full, Wang Boxuan hit a single that brought in two runs, putting the Hawks in the lead. After that, the second baseman, Lin Ziwei, made a mistake, which gave the Hawks two more runs. Wu Nianting and Zhang Zhaoyuan then hit singles, each scoring one run.

            <h1>Japan Will Deploy Long-Range Missiles Sooner, First in Kumamoto to Watch China</h1>
            <p>Japan's Ministry of Defense announced today that it will deploy a new and improved long-range missile. This missile is called the "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missile" and can strike back at enemies. The first missiles, which are launched from land, will be placed in Kumamoto this year. News in Japan said that Japan is worried China might attack Taiwan. So, Japan thinks it needs to make its defense stronger in the southwest part of the country.</p>
            <p>Japan is actively working to make the Type 12 missile fly much farther. This missile is used by Japan's army. Its range will change from a little over 100 kilometers to 1000 kilometers. The land-launched version is almost ready. They are now testing versions that can be launched from ships and fighter planes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Defense said today that the land-launched missile will first be placed at the Kenjun Base of the Ground Self-Defense Force in Kumamoto City. This will happen this year or next year. In 2027, it will be placed at the Fuji Base of the Ground Self-Defense Force in Shizuoka Prefecture.</p>
            <p>The improved Type 12 missiles that launch from ships or fighter planes will be used sooner than planned. They will start using them in 2027 instead of 2028.</p>
            <p>The version launched from ships will be put on the warship "Teruzuki." This ship is based at Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture. The version launched from planes will be put on improved F-2 fighter jets. These jets will be stationed at the Hyakuri Air Base in Ibaraki Prefecture.</p>
            <p>Japan is also making a very fast gliding weapon to protect its small islands. It is called the "High-Speed Glide Bomb for Island Defense" (HVGP). This weapon was supposed to be deployed in 2026. However, it will now be deployed earlier this year to a training group at the Fuji Base in Shizuoka Prefecture. Also, in 2026, new special groups will be made to use this weapon. They will be at the Kamifurano Base in Hokkaido and the Ebino Base in Miyazaki Prefecture.</p>
            <p>The Sankei Shimbun newspaper reported that placing the missiles in Kumamoto this year is mainly because Japan is worried about a possible attack on Taiwan by China. Japan feels it must make its defense stronger in the southwest area.</p>
            <p>Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said today in a press meeting, "Japan is 3000 kilometers long from east to west and north to south. To protect this area, we need to have the ability to stop and remove an attack if any part is invaded."</p>
            <p>When these long-range missiles are deployed, it will be the first time Japan has "counter-attack capabilities." This means the ability to attack enemy bases. This is a big change since Japan's army was created in 1954.</p>
            <p>The news also said that besides the improved Type 12 missile and the HVGP, the Ministry of Defense plans to buy "Tomahawk" cruise missiles from the United States between 2025 and 2027.</p>
            <p>In December 2022, Japan approved new plans for its national security, including the "National Security Strategy." These plans said that Japan would have "counter-attack capabilities." This is a very big change in Japan's defense policy since the Second World War. Many people think Japan's decision to have "counter-attack capabilities" is aimed at China and North Korea.</p>
            <p>The National Security Strategy (NSS) was first written in 2013 by the government of Abe Shinzo. It was changed for the first time in December 2022. The new defense plans state that China's growing military is the "biggest strategic challenge Japan has ever faced."</p>
