Former US President Donald Trump announced on social media that he will put a 25% tax on goods coming from Japan and South Korea. This news comes before a trade agreement deadline on July 9th in Washington. These letters are the first he has sent to trade partners.

Trump sent similar letters to the leaders of Japan and South Korea. He said the tariffs will begin on August 1st because trade between these countries and the US is "unfortunately not fair."

Bloomberg News reported that Trump also told Japan and South Korea not to take revenge. If they do, the US will punish them more.

Trump's letters said, "If you decide to raise your taxes for any reason, those numbers will be added to our 25% tax."

**Police Arrest 12 Suspects for Illegal Medical Beauty Equipment**

Police in Taipei have arrested 12 people, including a 51-year-old man who runs a medical equipment company. This group illegally brought medical beauty tools from places like mainland China and rented them to beauty clinics. The police and prosecutors started looking into this after getting a tip.

The police found that this group was bringing in illegal beauty equipment, like "Thermage" machines and medicines, from outside Taiwan without permission from the Ministry of Health and Welfare or the original makers. They then rented these tools to many beauty clinics in Taipei and New Taipei City. This put unknowing patients at risk and caused worries about health and safety.

The police searched the companies and clinics involved yesterday and today. They found the four brothers who ran the company and other employees. All 12 suspects were sent to the Taipei Prosecutors' Office today. They are accused of breaking laws about medical equipment, fraud, and doctors' practices.
