            <h1>Israel Plans to Control Gaza City; Netanyahu Explains 5 Rules for Ending War</h1>
            <p>Israel's security group recently decided to fully control Gaza City. Many people did not agree with this decision. Today, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, held a meeting with reporters from around the world. He said that the Gaza Strip will not have weapons anymore. He also explained 5 main rules for Israel to end the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that Netanyahu told the international reporters about these 5 rules for finishing the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>These rules include: Hamas, a Palestinian group, must give up its weapons; all Israeli people held hostage must be set free; the Gaza Strip must not have any military; Israel must have "strong control over safety" in the Gaza Strip; and a new "local government" must be made that is not part of Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said that the Israeli government plans to take full control of Gaza City. He believes this is the "best way" to end the war and defeat Hamas. He also said that Israel will let people go to special safe areas. In these areas, they will get "enough" food, be safe, and receive medical help.</p>
            <p>He also said again that Hamas is responsible for the problem with aid in the Gaza Strip. He accused Hamas of taking the aid that was meant for people.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu showed a picture. He said the picture showed a lot of aid that Israel allowed into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom border crossing, but it had not been collected yet.</p>
            <p>He also talked about a plan with 3 steps to fix this problem. These steps include making safe paths for giving out help, having more safe places for giving out help that are managed by the "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation," and having the Israeli army and other groups drop more supplies from the air.</p>

            <h1>Japanese Warship Entered Chinese Waters by Mistake Last Year, Was Warned by Chinese Military with Shells</h1>
            <p>Japanese news reported today that a Japanese navy ship, called "Suzutsuki," accidentally went into China's sea area near Zhejiang province last July. The Chinese military warned the ship by firing at least two shells. It is not common for China to shoot warning shells at other countries' ships. This shows it was a dangerous situation where fighting could have started quickly.</p>
            <p>Japan's Kyodo News got this information from people who know a lot about Japan and China. They reported that on July 4th last year, early in the morning, the Japanese navy ship Suzutsuki was sailing near Zhejiang province to watch Chinese military training from international waters. The Chinese military saw the Japanese ship Suzutsuki moving towards China's sea area. They asked Suzutsuki many times to change its direction. Just before Suzutsuki entered China's sea area, the Chinese military fired one shell to warn it.</p>
            <p>After Suzutsuki entered China's sea area, the Chinese military fired another shell, telling Suzutsuki to leave. The Suzutsuki ship was not hit by the shells and was not damaged.</p>
            <p>The report said that the Suzutsuki ship's electronic sea map system was not set correctly. The switch was not turned to the system that shows the borders between international waters and other countries' sea areas. This mistake meant the ship did not notice it had gone into China's sea area. The Chinese military then fired warning shots. The Suzutsuki ship sailed in China's sea area for about 20 minutes.</p>
