            <h1>Trump Says US Government Will Own 10% of Intel</h1>
            <p>US President Trump announced today that the American government will own 10% of Intel. This agreement means the government will have a share in the chip-making company. This is a new and unusual way for the US government to get involved in how businesses are run.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Intel did not want to comment on this news. However, Intel's stock price went up by more than 6% during the day.</p>
            <p>Just a few weeks ago, Trump asked Intel's new CEO, Patrick Chan, to leave his job. Trump said that Chan had "big conflicts of interest" because of his business dealings with Chinese companies.</p>
            <p>Earlier, SoftBank Group invested two billion US dollars in Intel. This was seen as a big sign of trust for Intel, as the company has been facing difficulties and changes.</p>
            <p>Experts say that the US government helping Intel might give the company more chances to improve its chip manufacturing business, which has been losing money. But Intel still has many problems, such as weak product plans and new factories that are not attracting many customers.</p>
            <p>Trump, who met with Patrick Chan on the 11th, is using new strategies for national security. He has pushed the US government to spend billions of dollars working with companies in areas like semiconductors (chips) and rare earth minerals. For example, he made a "pay-to-play" deal with Nvidia and an agreement with MP Materials, a company that produces rare earth minerals, to make sure the US gets important raw materials.</p>
            <p>Patrick Chan became Intel's CEO in March this year. He wanted to help the large chip company get back on track. In 2024, Intel lost 18.8 billion US dollars. This was the first time Intel had lost so much money since 1986.</p>

            <h1>Federal Reserve Head Keeps Door Open for Lower Interest Rates Amid Trump's Pressure</h1>
            <p>Today, Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve (Fed), gave an important speech. In his speech, he suggested that the Fed might lower interest rates. This comes as US President Trump is pushing hard for interest rate cuts. People in the market now think there is a 91% chance that interest rates will be lowered in September.</p>
            <p>Last year, at a big economic meeting called the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, Powell hinted that it was time to lower interest rates. However, after his speech this year, the situation seems less clear.</p>
            <p>Trump is strongly urging the Fed to cut interest rates. But because economic information is mixed â€“ some good, some bad â€“ Powell is being more careful about interest rates.</p>
            <p>Today, Powell warned that the economy faces challenges because both rising inflation (when prices go up) and a weak job market are happening at the same time.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Powell said there is "a growing risk of a weaker job market." He explained that these problems could quickly lead to job losses.</p>
            <p>Powell noted, "Even though the job market looks balanced, this balance is strange because both the number of available jobs and the number of people looking for jobs are slowing down a lot."</p>
            <p>Powell also added that "the effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible." He expects these effects to become even clearer in the next few months.</p>
            <p>He believes it is uncertain when and how much tariffs will affect prices.</p>
            <p>However, Powell promised, "We will not let a one-time rise in prices turn into a continuous problem with inflation."</p>
            <p>This was Powell's last speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium as the Fed chairman. His time as chairman will end in May 2026.</p>
            <p>After Powell's speech, the FedWatch tool from the CME Group showed that the market now thinks there is a 91% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September. This is much higher than before.</p>

            <h1>European Stock Markets End Higher, Expecting US Interest Rate Cuts</h1>
            <p>Today, European stock markets became stronger after midday and finished higher. This happened because people expect the United States to lower interest rates soon. Also, stock markets in Asia, led by China, performed well, which helped European markets.</p>
