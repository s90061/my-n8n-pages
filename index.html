The United States, led by former President Trump, announced a new 30% tax on goods from the European Union. This tax will start on August 1st. Many leaders in the Czech Republic and the EU are worried about this.

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said this tax would be bad for trade between the EU and the US. He also said that the EU should work together and talk to the US to solve this problem and protect their businesses. Other Czech politicians also said it was a risky decision for both money and diplomacy. They asked the EU to fight back or rely less on the US. The head of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU is ready to talk before August 1st, but also warned that they might take action if needed.

**Defense Minister Gu Lixiong Inspects Troops, New Missiles Shown**

Defense Minister Gu Lixiong visited the Marine Corps 66th Brigade. This was on the fifth day of Taiwan's Han Kuang 41 military exercise. The minister saw the troops quickly get their anti-aircraft weapons ready, including new portable Stinger missiles, which were shown for the first time.

The Marine Corps 99th Brigade also moved north using the highway for the first time to help in the exercise. This exercise helps Taiwan practice defending against enemy attacks and landings. Taiwan received these portable Stinger missiles from the US in 2015. This means Taiwan has four different types of Stinger missiles.
