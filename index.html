            <h1>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba Steps Down, Will Not Run in Next Party Leader Election</h1>
            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held a press conference tonight to announce his resignation. He said it was the right time to step down because trade talks between Japan and the US about tariffs had finished. When reporters asked him if he would run in the next election for the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he clearly said, "I will not run."</p>
            <p>Ishiba announced his resignation tonight at the Prime Minister's Official Residence, which is like the government's main office. He stated that he has always believed in leaving a position after finishing what needs to be done, and then making a decision at the right time. He also mentioned that he had said before that he, as the party leader, was responsible for the election results. Now that the US tariff talks are over, he believes it is the "right time." He said, "So I have decided to make way for a new successor."</p>
            <p>On the second day of this month, Ishiba admitted at a joint meeting of the LDP's two houses of parliament that he was responsible for the party losing the July Upper House election. Regarding when to resign, he said he "would make a decision at the right time."</p>
            <p>After Ishiba announced his resignation as prime minister tonight, the ruling LDP will hold an election to choose a new party leader. Normally, the LDP party leader serves a three-year term. Ishiba became the leader in September last year, and his term was supposed to last until September 2027.</p>
            <p>During the press conference tonight, when asked if he would run in the LDP party leader election, Ishiba clearly replied, "I will not run."</p>
            <p>The LDP will decide how to hold the upcoming party leader election. If it is a full election, it means 295 votes from members of parliament and 295 votes from party members, making a total of 590 votes. This type of election would take more than 12 days. If it is a simpler election, it would have 295 votes from members of parliament and 141 votes from local areas (3 votes from each of the 47 prefectures), making a total of 436 votes.</p>
            <p>After the LDP lost badly in the Upper House election on July 20, Ishiba faced pressure to resign. This was because he had said before the election that the goal was for the ruling LDP and its partner party, Komeito, to win at least half of the seats. However, they did not reach this goal. Also, the LDP had already done poorly in the Lower House election at the end of last year. This led to more calls within the LDP to blame Ishiba.</p>
            <p>About a month and a half passed since the big loss in the Upper House election, and Ishiba did not resign quickly. People thought this delay was like a "never-ending drama." It caused delays in the LDP's discussions about policies with other political parties. This created a "political vacuum" that continued for a while.</p>
            <p>Currently, the LDP is a minority ruling party, meaning it does not have more than half of the seats in both the Upper and Lower Houses of parliament. So, the new LDP leader might not necessarily be chosen as prime minister by the parliament. The ability of the new LDP leader to work with opposition parties will be a big test.</p>
