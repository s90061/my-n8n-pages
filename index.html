            <h1>Ukraine Needs 6 Billion Dollars for Military Production to Fight Russia with Drones</h1>
            <p>On July 21st, Ukraine's Defense Minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in a meeting that Ukraine needs another 6 billion US dollars (about 176.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars) to keep making defense products this year. This includes making drones and long-range weapons.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian media, Radio Svoboda, reported that Shmyhal explained this money would be used to make more FPV (First Person View) drones and drones that can stop other drones. This is to fight against Russia's ongoing attacks with "Shahed" suicide drones. The money will also help Ukraine attack further into Russia.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Shmyhal wrote on Telegram that Ukraine will get 5 American-made Patriot air defense systems. This was arranged with help from the United States and Germany. Germany also promised to invest in making long-range drones in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Also, the Netherlands announced that it will give 200 million Euros (about 6.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars) to help Ukraine buy defense equipment to fight drone attacks. They will also set aside 125 million Euros (about 4.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars) for repairing and supporting F-16 fighter jets.</p>
            <p>Norway will also give 1 billion Euros (about 34.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars) to help Ukraine develop drones. Canada and Sweden announced they will give more military aid and make more investments.</p>
            <p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine fully in February 2022, the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) has brought together defense ministers and military leaders from 52 countries, including major countries from America and Europe. This meeting was led by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and British Defence Secretary John Healey.</p>
            <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also attended the meeting.</p>
            <p>Recently, Ukraine has been working hard to make more drones in its own country. They are especially focused on making new air defense drones that can stop Russia's "Shahed" drones. Ukraine's military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that these interceptor drones can stop "Shahed" drones 70% of the time, which is better than traditional weapon systems.</p>
            <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also ordered today that all interceptor drones must be made through contracts in the future. He also said that training more drone operators and building related facilities are very important right now.</p>
            <p>According to "Ukrayinska Pravda", in 2023, Ukraine's defense industry received 500 million US dollars (about 14.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars) from Western countries to develop and produce weapons. Some experts say that Ukraine's military industry could make up to 35 billion US dollars each year. But right now, because of a lack of money, they only make about 15 billion US dollars (about 440.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars), which is only 40% of what they could make.</p>
            <p>In comparison, Russia's defense budget for 2024 is very high, at 150 billion US dollars (about 4.4 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). To keep fighting, Ukraine's defense budget for 2025 will be 31.1% of its total economy (GDP). The total amount is expected to be 2.6 trillion Hryvnias (about 1.83 trillion New Taiwan Dollars), which is 412 billion Hryvnias (about 289.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars) more than the year before.</p>

            <h1>Washington Post: Trump's Strong Actions Against Brazil Did Not Work</h1>
            <p>Sao Paulo, July 21st (CNA) â€“ The Washington Post newspaper today published an article saying that Donald Trump's strong actions against Brazil did not work well. He had announced that he would put a 50% tax on goods imported from Brazil. This was because he was unhappy about the Brazilian Supreme Court's trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
            <p>Ishaan Tharoor, a writer for The Washington Post, believes that Trump's decision to add a 50% tax on Brazilian goods "did not help." This action did not make Brazil weaker. Instead, it made the current President Lula's government look stronger and gained support from people in Brazil.</p>
            <p>The article says that President Lula's strong reaction to the new taxes made him more popular. It even got support from some business leaders who usually criticize the Brazilian government.</p>
            <p>Diplomatic sources from Brazil and the United States have publicly said that Trump's actions hurt America's image as a supporter of democracy.</p>
            <p>According to BBC Brazil News, the relationship between Brazil and the United States is getting worse. While the Brazilian Supreme Court is investigating former President Bolsonaro for possibly trying to start a coup, the US reacted by canceling the US visa of Brazilian Judge Alexandre de Moraes. A few days before, Moraes had ordered restrictions on Bolsonaro's movements, including making him wear an electronic ankle monitor. This action by the US was also called a "political witch hunt" against Brazilian courts.</p>
            <p>The United States is the third largest buyer of goods from Brazil, after China and the European Union. The new taxes are planned to start on August 1st. Brazilian government officials and experts believe that the US government is not likely to change its mind about these taxes, because the political problems between the two countries are getting worse.</p>

            <h1>US House of Representatives Passes Bill on Taiwan Conflict; Will Show Money of Chinese Officials to Stop Attack on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 21st (CNA) â€“ The US House of Representatives today approved a bill by speaking aloud, with no one disagreeing. This bill is called the "Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act." It asks the government to show how much money high-ranking Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials have in the US if China takes military action against Taiwan. The lawmakers who proposed the bill stressed that the money and bank accounts of corrupt CCP leaders will be made public for the Chinese people to know.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act" was first proposed in February this year. It was put forward by Lisa McClain, who leads the Republican group in the House, and Brad Sherman, a senior Democrat who has long supported Taiwan. The bill targets members of the CCP Central Political Bureau Standing Committee and members of the Central Committee whose jobs involve Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The bill requires the Treasury Department to report to Congress about the money these officials have. This includes the total amount of money, what kind of money it is, and the names of the banks involved. It also asks for a report to Congress on how this money was obtained and if any illegal or corrupt methods were used to get or use the money.</p>
            <p>The bill also gives the Treasury Secretary the power to stop CCP officials from using their money in US banks. It also says that a simple summary or part of the report must be made public online on the Treasury Department's website and social media accounts, in Chinese, English, or any other language the Secretary thinks is suitable.</p>
            <p>The bill also asks the Treasury Secretary to stop banks from doing big financial deals with the immediate family members of these officials.</p>
            <p>The US national intelligence agency released a report in March this year called "The Wealth and Corruption Activities of the Chinese Communist Party Leadership." This report stated that even though Xi Jinping became the head of the CCP in 2012, his relatives might have sold some property. However, Xi's family still owns business interests and financial investments worth millions of US dollars.</p>
            <p>"America must be careful as China becomes more aggressive," said Lisa McClain, one of the bill's proposers, just before the vote this afternoon. As a representative from Michigan, a state that understands how important manufacturing, trade, and peace in the world are, "I deeply understand how important peace in the Indo-Pacific region is for jobs and the economy in the US."</p>
            <p>She pointed out that Taiwan is not only a democratic partner for the US, but also a very important part of the world's supply chains. This is especially true for semiconductors, which power many devices from cars to defense systems.</p>
            <p>McClain said that this bill sends a clear message from both political parties: if Beijing starts a war with Taiwan, there will be consequences.</p>
            <p>"We are talking about real, specific consequences. The financial deals and overseas bank accounts of corrupt CCP leaders will be made public and shown to the Chinese people," she stated.</p>
            <p>McClain emphasized that the US is not starting a fight but is trying to stop one from happening. Deterrence is strongest when it is believable. And right now, being believable means passing this bill.</p>
            <p>A US bill must be passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives with the exact same words, and then sent to the White House for the President to sign before it becomes law. The "Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act" was also passed by the House of Representatives without anyone disagreeing in the last session, but it did not get voted on in the Senate afterward.</p>
