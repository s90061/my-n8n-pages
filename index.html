            <p>New York, July 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ Today, world oil prices went up. This happened after former US President Donald Trump said he might put sanctions on India.

The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil reached its highest point in one month.</p>
            <p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for September delivery went up by 1.1%. It is now $70.00 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Fed Resists Trump's Pressure Not to Cut Rates, Powell Says Central Bank Independence Benefits Public Good</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ Today, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) had a meeting and decided to keep interest rates the same again. This happened even though President Trump kept asking them to lower rates. Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed, spoke at a press conference. He said that it is good for the public if the central bank is independent.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that after the Fed announced its decision on interest rates, Powell told reporters, "I think having an independent central bank has always been a good way to organize things for the public."</p>
            <p>He also added, "This allows us to focus on data, changes in what we expect, the balance of risks, and all the things we talked about when we make very difficult decisions, instead of politics."</p>
            <p>President Trump's policies on taxes on imports have changed a lot. Also, it takes time to see how these import taxes affect prices. So, Fed officials want to wait and see the economic information from this summer. Then, they will decide how prices are affected.</p>
            <p>But the Fed's way of waiting for information has made Trump angry. Trump has often said that Powell has not lowered interest rates enough.</p>
