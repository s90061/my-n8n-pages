            <h1>Pope Criticizes Gaza War as Barbaric, Calls for Peaceful Resolution</h1>
            <p>(Castel Gandolfo, Italy, July 20th, Central News Agency) Pope Leo XIV of the Roman Catholic Church strongly criticized the "barbaric" war in Gaza today. He also strongly spoke against "the misuse of power." A few days ago, the Israeli army attacked a Catholic church in the Gaza Strip, and 3 people died.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Pope Leo XIV said at the end of the Angelus prayer in his summer home in Castel Gandolfo, near Rome: "I ask again for this cruel war to stop at once. We must find a way to solve the conflict peacefully."</p>
            <p>On July 18th, the Pope talked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He said he was "deeply sad" about the Israeli airstrike on the Holy Family Church in Gaza City on the morning of July 17th.</p>
            <p>About 600 people who had to leave their homes were staying in this church. Most of them were children, including dozens with special needs.</p>
            <p>Leo XIV said today: "Sadly, this action makes the ongoing military attacks on civilians and religious places in Gaza worse."</p>
            <p>"I ask the international community again to follow humanitarian law. They must protect civilians. It is strictly forbidden to punish groups of people, use too much power, or force people to move from their homes."</p>
            <p>The Pope also showed "understanding and care" for "my dear Christian brothers and sisters in the Middle East" who "often feel helpless" in this difficult situation.</p>
