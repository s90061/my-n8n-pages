            <h1>US Confirms First Human Case of Screwworm Disease; Patient Returned from Central America</h1>
            <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today announced the first human case of "New World screwworm" disease in the US. This case was linked to travel and came from a country where the disease is active.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for HHS, Andrew G. Nixon, told Reuters that the Maryland Department of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked into the case. On August 4, the CDC confirmed it was New World screwworm disease. The patient had traveled back from El Salvador.</p>
            <p>Reuters had previously reported last week that the CDC confirmed a New World screwworm case in Maryland. That patient had visited Guatemala.</p>
            <p>New World screwworm is a type of bug that lives on cows and other warm-blooded animals, eating their flesh.</p>
            <p>Mr. Nixon did not talk about the different ideas about where the infection came from. He only said that it is a "very low risk to public health in the United States."</p>
            <p>The US government has not found any animal cases of New World screwworm this year.</p>
            <p>US government and industry officials have different stories about where this human case started. This might worry farmers, beef producers, and animal breeders even more. They are already very careful about possible infections in the US because screwworms have moved north from Central America and southern Mexico.</p>
            <p>More than a week ago, government officials, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, went to Texas. They announced plans to build a facility there to kill these flies and stop the screwworms.</p>

            <h1>U18 Player Hsu Shu-cheng, Once Scared of the Ball, Becomes Good Shortstop, Inspiring Kinmen Players</h1>
            <p>Hsu Shu-cheng, a shortstop for the U18 World Cup baseball team, is the first youth baseball player from Kinmen to join the national team in 32 years. His first coach, Wu Zhi-wei, saw Hsu change from being very scared of the ball to being called a possible "powerful shortstop." Wu felt very proud and hopes Hsu's story will encourage other baseball players in Kinmen.</p>
            <p>The U18 World Cup baseball games will start on September 5 in Okinawa, Japan. After two training periods, the Taiwan team announced its 20 chosen players on August 20. Shortstop Hsu Shu-cheng is one of the important players. He is the first youth national baseball player from Kinmen in 32 years, following Yang Chung-liang.</p>
            <p>Taiwan team head coach Liao Hong-yuan has often said that Hsu Shu-cheng has a bright future. Liao once said that Hsu has great skills, moves well, and throws smoothly. Even though he is not big, he can hit with good power. He might become a "powerful shortstop" and even get to play baseball outside of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-cheng played baseball in Kinmen during elementary and junior high school. His first coach, Wu Zhi-wei, told a reporter that when he coached Hsu in elementary school, he noticed Hsu moved well and had a lot of potential. Hsu also listened very well and did everything the coach asked. Even though he was quite thin, he worked very hard. Wu said, "He became a good player by working hard."</p>
            <p>Wu Zhi-wei used to play as an infielder. He shared his most memorable moment: Hsu Shu-cheng was very afraid of the ball at first. "When the ball came, he would turn his head away when he tried to catch it." But Wu Zhi-wei saw Hsu's talent and found ways to help him get better. They also got money for a pitching machine. With more than a year of training, Hsu slowly stopped being afraid of the ball.</p>
            <p>When Hsu Shu-cheng was in fifth grade, his defense became more steady. Wu Zhi-wei always taught him to be careful and strong when throwing and catching as an infielder. Now, Hsu Shu-cheng has strong skills as a shortstop and has done very well. Wu Zhi-wei feels happy to see such good comments about Hsu.</p>
            <p>Wu Zhi-wei still talks to Hsu Shu-cheng. He knows that people think Hsu could play baseball in other countries. Wu always tells Hsu to take care of his body because his baseball career is still long. Wu Zhi-wei and another coach, Huang Kuo-wei, have put a lot of effort into making baseball popular again in Kinmen. Wu Zhi-wei also said that Hsu Shu-cheng's story will greatly encourage other baseball players in Kinmen.</p>

            <h1>EVA Air and Starlux Airlines Offer Business Class Upgrades for Soldiers' Day to Honor Military</h1>
            <p>China Airlines announced that on September 3, which is Soldiers' Day, active military personnel can get a free upgrade to business class. Following this, EVA Air and Starlux Airlines also announced today that they will offer special offers for military personnel on Soldiers' Day. On some international flights, soldiers will be able to get business class upgrades first.</p>
            <p>China Airlines announced today that active military personnel flying on international flights from Taiwan on Soldiers' Day will get special check-in service and free business class upgrades if there are empty seats. This is to thank the military for their great efforts and for protecting the country.</p>
            <p>EVA Air also announced on its website today that it will offer upgrade deals on Soldiers' Day. Active military personnel who fly on EVA Air and Uni Air international flights from Taoyuan, Songshan, or Kaohsiung on September 3 will have a chance to get an upgrade to business class.</p>
            <p>EVA Air explained that these upgrades are only for international flights with two types of seating (economy and business) that leave from Taoyuan, Songshan, and Kaohsiung airports. However, some flights are not included in this offer. These are Bangkok flights BR75/BR67/BR211/BR201, Singapore flights BR215/BR225, Jakarta flight BR237, Ho Chi Minh flights BR391/BR395, and Shanghai flight BR712.</p>
            <p>EVA Air said that military personnel can join this offer by showing their military ID at the EVA Air ticket counter at the airport they are leaving from. They will need to verify their ID and sign up. More details can be found at the ticket counter on the day of travel. Also, starting from September 3, the current offer of "priority boarding for active military personnel" will now also include one family member traveling with them, if that family member has a family dependent pass.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines also decided to offer similar special deals. Starlux Airlines said that to celebrate Soldiers' Day on September 3, they will offer active military personnel free business class upgrades if there are empty seats. Active military personnel flying on Starlux Airlines flights with two types of seating (A330/A321neo planes) that leave from Taiwan on that day can sign up by showing their military ID when they check in. They will have a chance to get a business class upgrade if seats are available.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Starlux Airlines stated that starting from September 3, active military personnel and one family member traveling with them can use the priority boarding service for all flights leaving from Taiwan. They just need to show their military ID and family dependent pass when getting on the plane.</p>
