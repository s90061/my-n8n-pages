            <h1>Taiwan Needs to Win Against Germany in U18 World Cup; Left-Hander Chung Yi-en to Start Again</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan team for the U18 World Cup baseball tournament is sure to move on to the next round, called the Super Round. But they still need to win their last game against Germany tomorrow. This game is important because it will affect their ranking in the Super Round. The team will have their left-handed pitcher, Chung Yi-en, start the game.</p>
            <p>The U18 World Cup baseball tournament is happening in Okinawa, Japan. Taiwan won their first game against China, then lost to the USA. They won against Panama yesterday and then against Australia today. So, they have won 3 games and lost 1 game in the first round. This means they are definitely going to the Super Round.</p>
            <p>Even though Taiwan has already made it to the next round, their game against Germany tomorrow at 5:30 PM is still very important. The result of this game will decide how well they start in the Super Round, so they will try their best to win.</p>
            <p>Taiwan will have Chung Yi-en start the game. He is a left-handed pitcher who was chosen by the Rakuten Monkeys team in the first round of this year's professional baseball draft. Chung Yi-en also started the first game against China in this tournament. He pitched for 4 innings, only allowed 1 hit, struck out 8 batters, and walked 3. He did not let the other team score any runs and got the win. He will be a main pitcher again tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's batters need to improve their hitting. In their first three games, the other teams all started with left-handed pitchers, and Taiwan's batters did not hit very well against them. Germany's starting pitcher tomorrow, Tom Apfelbaum, is also left-handed.</p>
            <p>Apfelbaum started a game against Australia on September 5th. He pitched for 2 innings and allowed 2 hits. He struck out 3 batters and walked 2, letting in 2 runs. This game did not affect his personal win or loss record.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Bank and 8 Other Banks to Test Gold Tokenization by End of Year</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Bank has announced a new project to join the global trend of turning real-world assets (RWA) into digital tokens. They are starting a project called "Interbank Application Joint Demonstration of Precious Metals Business Using RWA Tokenization Technology." Taiwan Bank will work with 8 other financial companies, including Land Bank of Taiwan and Hua Nan Bank. Together, they will explore new ways to use blockchain technology in the precious metals business. They plan to finish the first tests by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank announced today in a press release that this is a historic step for Taiwan's financial industry as the world moves towards making real-world assets digital. On August 22, Taiwan Bank officially launched this project. It is the first large project by local financial groups to turn precious metals into digital tokens.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank explained that they suggested this project. They are working with 8 other financial groups: Land Bank of Taiwan, Hua Nan Bank, Chang Hwa Bank, Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, Taiwan Business Bank, E.SUN Bank, CTBC Bank, and LINE Bank. They are using a special system called the "Joint Self-Demonstration Mechanism" from the FinTechSpace to explore how blockchain technology can be used for precious metals.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank said that many international projects focus on turning digital financial assets into tokens. But in this project, Taiwan Bank chose to focus on physical assets like precious metals. They are especially looking at how smart contracts can help move physical assets between different banks. They want to make customer service better, improve how fast things are done, and lower costs. They are also checking if it's possible to combine services at physical bank branches with tokenization technology.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank pointed out that the 9 banks involved have brought together many experts. These experts come from different areas like business, legal rules, digital finance, information technology, and cybersecurity. More than a hundred people are working on this project. This shows that all the banks care a lot about new financial technologies.</p>
            <p>Yang Tien-li, who is the manager of the Precious Metals Department at Taiwan Bank, said that this project uses a two-layer system. For transactions between banks, they will use tokens on a special blockchain. But customers will still use their gold passbook accounts for trading. They are testing this system in a fake environment to see if it works for things like taking out gold products at different banks.</p>
            <p>Yang Tien-li stressed that using smart contracts, which automatically follow trading rules, will not only help banks clear transactions faster but also create new opportunities for the precious metals business. It could lead to new types of decentralized financial services. In the future, people who own gold tokens could not only keep their money safe but also earn extra money through new ways like "liquidity staking." This would create more types of value.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-chih, who is the head of Taiwan Bank's Innovation Lab, said that the project will get technical help from a blockchain company called BSOS (Wangu Technology). They will look closely at the full life cycle of issuing tokens, including creating, transferring, taking out, and destroying them. The experience gained from this project with many banks will help create industry standards and best practices. This will build a strong foundation for Taiwan's financial industry in the area of virtual assets.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank said that they expect to finish the first results of this project by the end of this year. At that time, they will offer clear plans for how to issue tokens, business models, and related suggestions. This information can help the government make new rules. This project with many banks is not just a test of new technology. It is also an important step for Taiwan's financial industry to become more digital and global. They hope it will help Taiwan become a key place for new digital asset ideas in Asia.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Tesla's US Market Share Falls to Nearly 8-Year Low Due to More Competition</h1>
            <p>According to information given to Reuters by Cox Automotive, a company that studies car markets, Tesla's share of the electric vehicle market in the United States went down in August. This is the lowest it has been in almost 8 years. This happened because customers are choosing electric cars from other new companies.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that sales of electric cars in the U.S. will continue to grow until September. After that, they expect sales to drop because a federal tax discount for buying cars will end at the end of this month. This will put more financial pressure on Tesla and other car makers.</p>
            <p>Cox Automotive's early information shows that Tesla used to sell over 80% of all electric cars in the U.S. However, in August of this year, Tesla only sold 38% of all electric cars in the U.S. This is the first time its market share has been below 40% since October 2017.</p>
            <p>Other car companies are releasing new electric car models. But Tesla is focusing on making self-driving taxis (robotaxis) and human-like robots. Because of this, they have delayed or even canceled plans to make cheaper electric cars.</p>
            <p>Tesla's value as a company depends on these new projects. On September 5th, the company's leaders offered an extremely large payment plan to its CEO, Elon Musk. This plan is worth a trillion dollars and is linked to the company's value growing to 8.5 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, among other goals.</p>
            <p>So far, Tesla's main way of making money is still from selling cars. Their newest car, the electric pickup truck called Cybertruck, came out in 2023. But it is not selling as well as their older cars like the Model 3 sedan or the Model Y SUV. Tesla made small changes to the Model Y, which is very popular globally, but these changes were not as good as expected. Because of this, Tesla's sales are predicted to go down for the second year in a row.</p>
            <p>Stephanie Valdez Streaty, an analyst at Cox Automotive, told Reuters: "I know they see themselves as a robot and artificial intelligence (AI) company. But when you are still a car company and you don't release new products, your market share will naturally start to drop."</p>
            <p>Elon Musk's right-wing political beliefs and his relationship with former U.S. President Trump have also affected Tesla's public image. This year, Musk helped Trump with a plan to make the federal government smaller. But in May, Musk left the team, and his relationship with Trump changed.</p>
            <p>Early information shows that Tesla's sales grew only 3.1% in August. During the same time, the entire car market grew by 14%.</p>
