            <h1>Russian Drone Enters Poland; NATO Starts 'Eastern Sentry Action' to Boost Defense</h1>
            <p>Today, Mark Rutte, who is the head of NATO, said that NATO will make its defense stronger in the east. This is because a Russian drone flew into Poland's sky this week.</p>
            <p>NATO is doing this after it used its fighter jets for the first time in three and a half years to shoot down a Russian drone. This drone had flown into the sky of a NATO country. This happened since the war between Russia and Ukraine started.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rutte and Alexus Grynkewich, a top US general who leads NATO forces in Europe, held a press conference together. At the conference, Mr. Rutte said, "NATO is starting something called 'Eastern Sentry Action.' This will make our forces in the east even stronger."</p>
            <p>Mr. Rutte said these military actions will begin in the next few days. Countries like Denmark, France, the UK, and Germany will help. He said that these new forces will not only be "more normal military forces" but will also include "special units to deal with drone problems."</p>
            <p>He also said that NATO is still checking if Russia purposely sent the drone into Poland's sky. But no matter what, he said, "This act was careless and wrong."</p>
            <p>Before this, other NATO countries like France and Germany said they would send more fighter jets to Poland. General Grynkewich said, "Now, we are focusing on Poland. But this situation affects more than just one country. If one NATO country has a problem, it means all of NATO has a problem."</p>
            <p>He also stated, "'Eastern Sentry Action' will be flexible and quick. It will give better ways to stop attacks and defend ourselves when and where they are needed most."</p>
            <p>Poland's Defense Minister, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, thanked NATO for "acting quickly and making good decisions when facing Russia's aggressive actions." He said this new plan "is not just a smart military choice. It also shows that NATO takes care of the safety of the whole eastern area."</p>

            <h1>Former Chief Justice Karki Sworn in as Nepal's Prime Minister, Leads Temporary Government</h1>
            <p>Today, Sushila Karki, who was once the top judge in Nepal, became the new prime minister. She will lead a temporary government. This happened after the old government was removed because of big protests against corruption that caused deaths.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that Nepal's President, Ram Chandra Paudel, spoke to Ms. Karki during the ceremony shown on TV. He said, "Congratulations! We wish you and the country success."</p>
            <p>The old government had to step down because there were big and deadly protests in Nepal recently.</p>
            <p>Nepal, a country with 30 million people, had problems this week. The police and army tried to stop young people protesting against corruption. This led to a lot of violence, and at least 51 people died.</p>
            <p>The former prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, said he would leave his job on that day. No one knows where he is now.</p>

            <h1>Schroder Scores 26 Points, 12 Assists; Germany Beats Finland to Reach EuroBasket Final</h1>
            <p>Today, Germany showed how strong and experienced they are. They beat Finland 98 to 86. This win means they are the first team to reach the final game of the European Basketball Championship (EuroBasket).</p>
            <p>This is the first time Germany has reached the EuroBasket final since 2005. They won the championship in 1993, and now they are trying to win their second one.</p>
            <p>Dennis Schroder, a point guard for the NBA's Sacramento Kings, is on the German team, which is the world champion. He scored 26 points and helped his teammates score 12 times. He led his team to stop Finland's surprising dream of winning the championship. Schroder made 4 three-point shots and all 10 of his free throws during the game.</p>
            <p>Franz Wagner, another NBA player and a forward for the Orlando Magic, also played for Germany. He scored 22 points. In the second quarter, he made two three-point shots in a row. This helped Germany get a big lead of 49 to 30. This was the biggest lead Germany had in the whole game.</p>
            <p>For Finland, Olivier Nkamhoua scored the most points with 22. Lauri Markkanen, a forward for the Jazz, added 16 points. Near the end of the third quarter, Finland was only 6 points behind. Even though Finland tried hard to catch up, they could not stop Germany from winning.</p>
            <p>In the final game, Germany will play against either Greece or Turkey. The game between Greece and Turkey will happen later today.</p>
