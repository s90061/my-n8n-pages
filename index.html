            <h1>Tainan Liuying House Now Dangerous After Ground Collapses, City Government Works Fast to Fix Slope</h1>
            <p>In Liuying District, Tainan, a house in Xushan Village had its ground collapse next to it on the night of August 2nd. A parking shelter and vehicles fell down with the soil. Luckily, no one was hurt. After 8 people living in the house left yesterday, the collapse got bigger and damaged the house. Today, the city government quickly worked to make the slope strong again.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Government said today in a press release that the house in Xushan Village was affected by a landslide that caused its ground to fall away. Yesterday, people from the Civil Affairs Bureau, Water Resources Bureau, and the local district office went to the place to talk about what to do. They brought an excavator to put steel plates into the ground. They hoped this would slow down the collapsing hillside. But sadly, the house's foundation still collapsed.</p>
            <p>The Civil Affairs Bureau said that after checking, the house is now considered dangerous and it's not safe to live there. All 8 residents have been moved by the Liuying District Office to a safe place. This is to avoid any future problems.</p>
            <p>The Water Resources Bureau also explained that today, they quickly used steel rails and plates to make the bottom of the slope strong. This will stop the hillside from moving and collapsing more. Later, they will do more work and keep watching the area as needed.</p>

            <h1>US Dollar Falls as Rate Cut Hopes Rise, New Taiwan Dollar Jumps to NT$29.918</h1>
            <p>US job numbers were not as good as expected. This made investors worry about risks in the job market. Both the US dollar and US bond rates went down a lot. Other currencies went up. The New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) got stronger today, closing at NT$29.918 against the US dollar. It went up by 1.07 cents, returning strongly to the 29-dollar range. The total money exchanged in Taipei and Yuanta foreign exchange markets was 1.4675 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Taiwan announced a temporary 20% tariff rate, which was higher than Japan and South Korea. Also, the US dollar index became very strong, going above 100. On that day, the NTD fell quickly, going below the NT$30 mark and closing at NT$30.025. This was the lowest in over two months.</p>
            <p>Later, the US announced that fewer non-farm jobs were created in July than expected, and the unemployment rate also went up. This made people worry more about the US economy. US stocks fell a lot, and the US dollar index quickly dropped to 98. Many other currencies worldwide then became stronger.</p>
            <p>Today, the NTD opened at NT$29.95 against the US dollar. It quickly started to get much stronger, going up by more than 0.02 NTD. It reached its highest point of the day at NT$29.812. But as people started buying US dollars again, the gain got smaller.</p>
            <p>A currency trader explained that today's increase in the NTD was mainly because the US dollar fell a lot. Also, some foreign investors sent money to buy Taiwan stocks again, and companies that export goods sold foreign currency. This made the NTD go back above 29.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank's data shows that the US dollar index fell by 1.14% today. The New Taiwan Dollar went up by 0.36%. The Chinese Yuan rose by 0.47%, and the Korean Won went up sharply by 1.39%. The Japanese Yen had the biggest rise, going up by 1.80%.</p>
            <p>A currency trader said that Taiwan's temporary tax rate is out, but it's not the final one yet. The market is still watching, so not much money is being traded. In the short term, US job data looks weak, so people are watching how other economic data will turn out. Also, Taiwan is still waiting for the final tax rate and the results of the 232 investigation. Since the direction is not clear, the currency might stay between NT$29.8 and NT$30 for a while.</p>

            <h1>Airtac's July Revenue Reaches NT$2.649 Billion, a New High for the Same Period; More Orders Than Shipments</h1>
            <p>Airtac-KY, a company that makes pneumatic parts, announced today that its combined revenue for July was NT$2.649 billion. This is 1.9% less than last month, but 7.42% more than July 2024. It is the lowest in five months, but still the highest for any July in the company's history.</p>
            <p>Airtac-KY explained that in July, the value of new orders was still higher than the value of products shipped, which was better than expected. July's revenue and the average daily shipments were lower than last month due to normal seasonal changes in industry demand. But compared to last year, they grew well. In July, sales were especially good for products used in batteries, cars, and packaging machines.</p>
            <p>Airtac-KY's total combined revenue for the first seven months of the year was NT$19.698 billion. This is an 8.83% increase compared to the same period in 2024.</p>
            <p>Looking to the future, Airtac-KY said that tariffs continue to cause some delays in customers' decisions about making more products. But the overall market demand is slowly getting better. They expect the Chinese government will continue to support the market with policies as needed. Also, Airtac-KY keeps making new products, improving its brand image, and creating sales plans for different industries to get a bigger share of the market. Even with uncertain global conditions, Airtac-KY still has the same good outlook for this year as before.</p>
            <p>At an investor meeting at the end of July, Airtac-KY repeated that changes in exchange rates and tariffs will not affect them much. They expect their pneumatic parts business to grow more than the industry average this year. The company's goal for this year is to have overall growth in the low double-digit percentage range (about 11% to 13%).</p>
