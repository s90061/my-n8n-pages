            <h1>US Tariff Talks Not Yet Clear; Report Says ASEAN+3 Economy Will Grow Slower</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Wu Shen-hong, Singapore, July 23rd) Talks about US tariffs are not yet completely clear. People are watching to see if more goods will be affected. Experts from the ASEAN+3 (China, Japan, South Korea) Macroeconomic Research Office say that during this time of changing global trade, the region has stayed strong. However, US tariffs and unclear talks still affect the economy. They expect that the ASEAN+3 economy will grow more slowly this year and next year.</p>
            <p>The ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) released its quarterly report today. It expects the ASEAN+3 economy to grow by 3.8% this year. In 2026, it is expected to grow by 3.6%. This shows a slower growth.</p>
            <p>Muhammad Najib Razali, an expert on global economy and a professor at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, told CNA that for Malaysia, the US is a big buyer of its semiconductors and computer parts. The electronics industry makes up about 40% of Malaysia's exports. So, these new tariffs will affect businesses that make these products. Many industries worry about stricter checks and higher costs because of the tariffs. He asked ASEAN to trade more quickly with places like the EU and India. He also said that ASEAN can learn from how the EU works together to make trade stronger.</p>
            <p>Ho Dong, AMRO's chief economist, said in a press release that ASEAN+3 has stayed strong during a time of changing global trade. Most countries' leaders acted early to help with trade problems. The financial markets in the region are also strong.</p>
            <p>But AMRO noted that big uncertainties still hang over the ASEAN+3 economy. The biggest risk is that the US might increase tariffs and that trade talks are not clear. This could affect more goods. It might make trade worse and slow down economic growth in the region.</p>
            <p>Also, continuing political problems around the world and changes in the US and European economies could slow down economic growth. Ho Dong said that as global trade becomes more broken into smaller parts, working together in the region is now very important. By making regional cooperation stronger, staying open to the world, and supporting global trade rules, ASEAN+3 can become better at handling outside problems and find new chances for growth.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said that tariffs on goods from Japan will go down to 15%. Japan will invest 550 billion US dollars in the US. The US also "finished a trade deal" with the Philippines. The Philippines will open its markets to the US and have zero tariffs. The US will put a 19% tariff on goods from the Philippines.

            <h1>Blue Party Says Cao Xing-cheng Met Chinese Officials Before; Recall Group Criticizes Blue Legislators for Not Respecting Voters</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporters Liu Guan-ting, You Kai-hsiang, Taipei, July 23rd) The KMT party said today that Cao Xing-cheng, the former chairman of UMC who is now involved in big recall campaigns, met with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials in 2013. The KMT said that if we use Cao Xing-cheng's own idea that "meeting Chinese officials means betraying Taiwan and being close to the CCP," then Cao Xing-cheng is not just someone who agrees with the CCP, but he is one of them.</p>
            <p>The KMT held a press conference today. Ling Tao, the deputy head of their think tank, showed photos of Cao Xing-cheng meeting with a Chinese official in 2013. He said that Cao Xing-cheng went to Beijing for talks and even said, "Uniting might not be bad for Taiwan." The person sitting next to Cao Xing-cheng was Sun Ya-fu, who was then a deputy director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office. They met to talk about a "Cross-Strait PeacefuL Coexistence Law." Based on what Cao Xing-cheng has said, Ling Tao stated that this means Cao is not just someone who works with the CCP, but he is truly part of them.</p>
            <p>KMT spokesperson Yang Chih-yu said that Cao Xing-cheng and the DPP party have always used the idea of "resisting China and protecting Taiwan" to trick Taiwanese people. At the end of the big recall campaigns, they want to keep tricking people who already don't support them into changing their vote.</p>
            <p>Also, the "Anti-Communist and Taiwan Protection Volunteer Alliance" held a press conference this morning called "No Show, No Future." They talked about where legislators were when they missed the recall explanation meetings. Taoyuan City Council members Peng Chun-hao and Hsu Chia-jui, along with representatives from recall groups in Taoyuan districts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, were there.</p>
            <p>Peng Chun-hao showed charts and said that KMT legislators Chang Chih-lun, Lin Te-fu, Tu Chuan-chi, Lu Ming-che, Wan Mei-ling, Lu Yu-ling, Chiu Ruo-hua, and Ting Hsueh-chung all missed the official televised recall explanation meetings. They were seen at funerals and dinners instead. This shows their proud attitude and how they ignored the most open and clear way to explain their policies.

            <h1>Japan's Economy Minister: New US-Japan Trade Deal Does Not Cover Steel and Aluminum Tariffs</h1>
            <p>(CNA, Tokyo, July 23rd, reports from various foreign news sources) Akazawa Ryosei, the Minister in charge of Economic Revitalization who talks about tariffs with the US for Japan, said today that the 50% tariffs the US puts on steel and aluminum from Japan are not part of the trade deal announced earlier by both countries.</p>
            <p>Akazawa Ryosei told reporters in Washington D.C., "If you ask if this deal includes steel and aluminum, the answer is no."</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Akazawa Ryosei also said today that the new US-Japan trade deal does not include defense spending.</p>
            <p>He stated, "This agreement does not have anything about defense spending."</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump had asked his close friend, Japan, to spend more money on its military. Because of this, some people thought that defense spending might be a part of a bigger trade agreement. (Translated by Liu Wen-yu/Reviewed by Tsai Chia-min) July 23, 2025.</p>
