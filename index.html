            <h1>Train Service Between Dawu and Longxi Resumes; Buses Transport 1,548 People</h1>
            <p>The train service between Dawu and Longxi areas started again at 8:02 PM tonight. This morning, a lot of water leaked in the Da Bird Tunnel, which stopped electric trains from running. After quick repairs, the service is back to normal. Buses also helped by carrying 1,548 people on 36 trips.</p>
            <p>The leak in the Da Bird Tunnel on the South-Link Line caused power to cut off, so electric trains could not run between Dawu and Longxi. Taiwan Railways (TRA) quickly started bus services to help people. They also used diesel trains to pull other trains through the area where there was no power.</p>
            <p>TRA said tonight that by 7:40 PM, buses from Fangliao Station had made 17 trips, carrying 731 people. From Taimali Station, 15 trips carried 645 people. From Taitung Station, 4 trips carried 172 people. In total, 36 bus trips helped 1,548 people.</p>
            <p>TRA said that trains numbered 168 and higher, going in one direction, and trains numbered 165 and higher, going in the other direction, are now running normally. Train station staff and train crews have been asked to make more announcements and help guide passengers.</p>
            <p>TRA also said that if your train ticket was affected and you did not use it, you can get a refund within one year without paying any extra fees. If you have round-trip tickets, you can get a refund for both at the same time.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Nipun Choir Wins Gold in Tokyo, Despite China's Pressure to Remove Flag</h1>
            <p>A choir from Taiwan went to Japan for a singing competition in Tokyo. Before the event, China complained and asked for Taiwan's national flag to be removed. Even though this upset them, the Nipun Choir from Kaohsiung performed very well today. Tonight, they received good news: the Nipun Choir won a gold medal with a high score of 95.9 points.</p>
            <p>The 7th Tokyo International Choral Competition was held from July 25 to 27. Today, eight teams took part in the folk music section. Three of these teams were from Taiwan: the Bugulav Children's Art Troupe from Sing Chung Elementary School in Kaohsiung City, Sinyi Township Sibalang Elementary School from Nantou County, and the Nipun Choir. There were also two teams from China in the same group.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the organizers received a complaint. They then told the Taiwanese teams that they had to take down their national flag, which was hanging in the First Life Hall. Also, their name for the stage had to change from "Taiwan" to "Chinese Taipei."</p>
            <p>When Taiwan's office in Japan found out, they quickly talked to the choir and Legislator Chiu Yi-Ying, who was also in Japan. They kept talking with the organizers until the last moment before the competition this morning. Mr. Keiji Furuya, who leads the "Japan-ROC Parliamentary Friendship Association," also spoke up for Taiwan right away. However, the organizers still decided to change the name to "Chinese Taipei" and not display any national flags from any participating countries.</p>
            <p>Even after the flag incident, the Nipun Choir performed very well in the morning. Their final performance touched everyone in the audience. Tonight, they got the happy news. The Nipun Choir, which often wins big international competitions, won the gold medal with a score of 95.9. The team from Indonesia came in second with 94.8 points, and the team from the Philippines was third with 93.8 points.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-Chih, the conductor of the Nipun Choir, spoke to the Central News Agency. He said that this competition lasted three days. On the first two days, when they watched the competition, all Taiwanese teams were called "Taiwan," and flags of different countries were hanging nearby. But at noon on the second day, the organizers sent a message. It said that for the third day of the competition, "all Taiwanese teams must be called Chinese Taipei, and our national flag must be taken down." He said, "Even though they said they needed our agreement, we felt this was not fair." So, they quickly asked Taiwan's office in Japan for help.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen said that if the organizers wanted to follow the Olympic rules and change the name to "Chinese Taipei," maybe they could accept it. "But we could not allow our national flag to be taken down by itself," he said. If one flag was taken down, then all flags should be taken down.</p>
            <p>He said that even though the children were upset, if both sides could agree, they still wanted the children to perform. This is because only by performing can Taiwan's culture be seen by everyone. This is Taiwan's "soft power." He said, "When soft power is seen and recognized, it is more important than anything else." He was very thankful for everyone's help in making the situation end well.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen shared that he had thought, "If our flag is taken down alone, then we will not compete." Luckily, in the end, all flags were removed. Before the competition, the children promised to do their best. When he was conducting, their performance truly moved him. After finishing this excellent performance, "we only wished for one thing, which was the gold medal." And they won it.</p>
            <p>Legislator Chiu Yi-Ying went to Tokyo to support the Nipun Choir. She also helped to solve the sudden problem in the past two days. She was very happy that the team had a good result.</p>
            <p>She wrote on Facebook, "Children of Liugui, Kaohsiung, we are proud of you! Even though yesterday afternoon the organizers removed our national flag because of pressure from China, and our name had to be changed to Chinese Taipei (even though we are clearly from Kaohsiung), because of the continuous efforts and talks from our representative office, you stood on the stage and showed everyone the Nipun Choir's ability, and you also showed Taiwan! I just heard that we won the gold medal again, which is so touching! Children, thank you for making me feel better, and for bringing glory to Taiwan! Thank you!"</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Average Temperature in 2024 Was 24.6 Degrees Celsius: Warmest Ever</h1>
            <p>According to the Meteorological Administration, Taiwan's average yearly temperature last year was 24.6 degrees Celsius. This makes it the warmest year ever. Taipei had the most days with high temperatures, reaching 63 days. The Administration explained that these high temperatures are partly due to the long-term trend of global warming and partly related to the El NiÃ±o effect.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration released its "2024 Climate Annual Report." It showed that Taiwan's average yearly temperature last year was 24.6 degrees Celsius. This is 0.7 degrees higher than the usual average (23.9 degrees) and is the highest temperature ever recorded. All 22 weather stations across Taiwan reported temperatures higher than their usual averages. Also, all of them were among the top 10 warmest on record. Seven stationsâ€”Hsinchu, Taichung, Sun Moon Lake, Tainan, Chenggong, Taitung, and Dawuâ€”broke their own records for average temperature.</p>
            <p>Regarding very hot weather, last year, the number of "high temperature days" (when the daily highest temperature was 35 degrees Celsius or more after rounding) was fewer than usual at four stations: Penghu, Keelung, Hualien, and Hengchun. However, the other 18 stations had more or almost the same number of high temperature days as usual. Taipei had the most high temperature days, 63 in total, which is 19.8 days more than its usual average.</p>
            <p>The Meteorological Administration explained that the number of high-temperature days has slowly increased since the mid-1970s. This increase became even clearer from the 2010s to 2020. Also, since the mid-1960s, the number of low-temperature days has been slowly going down.</p>
            <p>For rainfall, the total average yearly rainfall last year was 2135.9 millimeters. This is close to the usual average of 2161.1 millimeters. When we look closer at how Taiwan's total yearly rainfall changes each year, it changes a lot. There is no clear trend of it increasing or decreasing. However, in the last 10 years, only 2 years (2016 and 2022) had more rainfall than usual. The other 8 years had less than usual.</p>
            <p>If we look at the number of rainy days, last year, the average was 127 days. This is 14.8 days fewer than the usual average of 141.7 days. It is the 7th lowest number of rainy days recorded in Taiwan's weather history. Looking further at how the number of rainy days changes each year, since the 1950s until now, the number of rainy days in Taiwan has clearly been decreasing.</p>
            <p>The Meteorological Administration explained that last year, Taiwan's average yearly temperature broke the old record, making it the warmest year. The reasons for this include the long-term trend of global warming, and also partly the El NiÃ±o effect. Global warming is a long-term trend. Because greenhouse gases are still increasing each year, there is a high chance that temperatures will continue to rise.</p>
            <p>The Meteorological Administration explained that with this background, the El NiÃ±o effect brings a short-term warming effect that pushes global temperatures even higher. At the same time, it makes extreme weather events happen more often and become stronger. This includes heatwaves, dry periods, heavy rain, and hurricanes. These effects are seen all over the world.</p>
            <p>Also, from December 2023 to February 2024 (winter), the monsoon system was weak. This made Taiwan's winter warmer and drier than usual. Last summer (June to August), because of the high pressure in the Pacific Ocean, there was less rain in places like the Indochinese Peninsula, the South China Sea, Taiwan, and coastal areas of East Asia. Also, the average summer temperature along the entire East Asian coast was clearly higher than usual.</p>
