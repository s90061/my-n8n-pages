            <h1>Portugal Recognizes Palestine After UK, Canada, Australia</h1>
            <p>New York, September 21st (AFP) â€“ After the UK, Canada, and Australia, Portugal announced today that it recognizes the State of Palestine. This makes Portugal another Western country to take this symbolic step. It happens as the war in Gaza still continues.</p>
            <p>Before the United Nations General Assembly debate starts tomorrow, Portugal's Foreign Minister, Paulo Rangel, told reporters in New York, "Recognizing the State of Palestine is now part of our basic, consistent, and widely agreed policy."</p>
            <p>He explained, "Portugal believes that a 'two-state solution' is the only way to achieve fair and lasting peace. It is also the way to help Israel and Palestine live together peacefully."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, the UK, Canada, and Australia announced they would recognize the State of Palestine. This made the UK and Canada the first G7 countries to do so. After the UN General Assembly debate begins, France and other countries are expected to follow.</p>

            <h1>Syria to Hold Parliament Elections on October 5th, First Under New Government</h1>
            <p>Damascus, September 21st (AFP) â€“ Syria's state news agency, SANA, reported today that Syria will hold its first parliament elections under the new Islamist government on October 5th.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the new parliament is expected to start a wider process towards democracy. This comes after almost 14 years of civil war and former President Bashar al-Assad stepping down last December. Critics say the current system does not include enough people from minority groups.</p>
            <p>The new parliament will also look at laws for big changes to the country's economic policies, which have been controlled by the state for a long time. It will also approve international agreements that could change Syria's foreign alliances.</p>
            <p>SANA reported that the People's Assembly will vote for 210 seats, and voting will happen in "all areas." The election committee said last month that voting in three provinces would be delayed because of safety concerns.</p>
            <p>About one-third of the People's Assembly seats will be chosen by President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Syria had planned to hold parliament elections in September.</p>
            <p>Syria released a new constitution in March to guide the country during the time of change under al-Sharaa's leadership. This document says that Islamic law is very important, but it also protects women's rights and freedom of speech. However, it has also caused worries that too much power might be given to the Islamist government.</p>
