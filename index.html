            <h1>Chang Li-shan Hopes for Active Talks with US to Avoid Extra Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Yunlin County Magistrate Chang Li-shan said today that the central government should talk more with the United States. They should ask for lower tariffs, like the European Union, where tariffs are not added on top of each other. This way, the rights of farmers, workers, and industries will be protected, and Taiwan will not be hurt in international trade.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan's Office of Trade Negotiations said that according to a US order, only the EU's tariffs are not calculated with added taxes. For other countries, the original MFN (Most Favored Nation) tariff rate is used, and then the extra tariff is added. For Taiwan, the original tariff has an extra 20% temporary tariff added.</p>
            <p>Chang Li-shan said that the US is asking the world to pay for its economic rules, which goes against the free and fair trade system built over a long time. This could cause global economic problems. Many workers might face unpaid leave or lose their jobs, and social support will be difficult. Both the central and local governments should have plans. Taiwan should work more with other countries for trade to reduce these problems.</p>

            <h1>WTT Yokohama Champions: Kao Cheng-jui Loses to US Player, Misses Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's table tennis player Kao Cheng-jui lost surprisingly today in the WTT Yokohama Champions tournament in Japan. In the top 16 singles match, he played against Kanak Jha from the US and lost 7-11, 11-6, 9-11, 5-11. This means he will not be in the quarterfinals.</p>
            <p>Kao Cheng-jui is 20 years old and ranked 27th in the world. Today was his first time playing against Kanak Jha, who is 25 years old and ranked 31st in the world. Before the match, more than 90% of fans who voted on the World Table Tennis (WTT) website thought Kao Cheng-jui would win.</p>
            <p>In the first game, Kao Cheng-jui and Jha played very close. When the score was 6-6, Jha scored many points with good shots from far away and two lucky shots that hit the net. So, Kao Cheng-jui lost the first game.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Kao Cheng-jui changed how he served. He quickly scored 5 points in a row and had a good start. He kept a lead of at least 3 points throughout the game and won it.</p>
            <p>In the third game, both players found it hard to score. Kao Cheng-jui was behind for most of the time and tried to catch up. He even tied the score at 9-9 near the end, but Jha scored 2 more points and won the game.</p>
            <p>In the important fourth game, Jha was still in control. Kao Cheng-jui called a timeout when he was losing 2-4. But after the break, the game did not change. Jha scored 5 points to 1, which helped him win the match.</p>
            <p>Four players from Taiwan were in the WTT Yokohama Champions tournament: Lin Yun-ju and Kao Cheng-jui for men's singles, and Cheng I-ching and Huang Yi-hua for women's singles. But all of them were eliminated before the top 16.</p>
            <p>Last year, Jha raised over 30,000 US dollars (about 900,000 New Taiwan dollars) on the GoFundMe website to help him go to the Paris Olympics. His achievement of reaching the quarterfinals in this Yokohama Champions tournament is his best result so far this season on the WTT tour.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Water Department: Water Will Not Be Off for 7 Days in a Row</h1>
            <p>There were reports that four areas in Taipei would have water stops, some for up to 7 days in a row, which worried people. The Taipei Water Department has clarified that water for engineering work will only be off from 11 AM to 4 PM each day. This will not affect daily life before work or after work, and water will definitely not be off for 7 days in a row.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Water Department sent out a message today to say that many news outlets reported that four Taipei areas would have water stops for up to 7 days in a row. They are now giving clear information about this.</p>
            <p>The Water Department said that to give people the best water quality, they keep replacing old pipes in Taipei. These pipe replacement projects are usually small, and they do not affect a large area.</p>
            <p>The Water Department stated that to cause less trouble for people, water for these projects is turned off from 11 AM to 4 PM every day. This means it will not affect people's normal daily routines before or after work. There will certainly not be a situation where water is off for 7 days in a row.</p>
            <p>The Water Department explained that most buildings in Taipei have water tanks, so people can still use water from their tanks during the 5 to 6 hours when water is off for construction. However, for a small number of homes without water tanks, there will be short periods without water each day. These people should store water before the work if they need it.</p>
            <p>The Water Department stressed that when they replace pipes, they choose small areas and short times to cause the least trouble for people. Information about the areas and times of these projects is available on the "Water Outage Inquiry" page of their official website.</p>
            <p>The Water Department also said they regularly send out news releases about water stops and put up signs at the work sites to let people know and remind them to store water beforehand. This helps to reduce any problems.</p>
