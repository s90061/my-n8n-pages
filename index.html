            <h1>New Taipei City Begins Building Its First Square for Indigenous Festivals, Expected to Open by Early 2026</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City started building its first square for indigenous people's seasonal festivals today. Mayor Hou Yu-ih said it should be finished by the end of February 2026. This square will be a special place for indigenous people to use. The city government will also connect other nearby resources to help share indigenous culture.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that over 62,000 indigenous people live in New Taipei City, making it the second-largest indigenous population among Taiwan's six main cities. In the past, indigenous people often had to use temporary places like basketball courts, parking lots, or riverside parks for their festivals and cultural events. To meet their needs, the New Taipei City government decided to build this new square next to the Longenpu public housing complex in Sanxia District.</p>
            <p>He also said that the project for the ritual square will cost a total of NT$30.7 million. The Council of Indigenous Peoples is giving more than NT$19.5 million for it. The design mixes traditional indigenous cultural symbols with modern building styles. In the future, the city will also combine nearby tourism, education, and social services to help spread indigenous culture.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih added that the main roof will be a steel frame dome with a thin cover, 30 meters wide. Its curved shape is inspired by indigenous headwear. The ground will have different colors to show directions, which helps with rituals. The columns will have mosaic tiles with traditional patterns. For the design of the entrance, indigenous artists, community representatives, and local indigenous groups will work together to make sure it truly shows local cultural characteristics.</p>
            <p>In addition, Mayor Hou Yu-ih announced that the city will increase the work allowance next year for indigenous leaders and the heads of indigenous development associations in each area. This is to support them for their long-term work in public affairs for their communities and for helping the city government promote indigenous matters. Each indigenous leader will receive an extra NT$1,000 per month.</p>
            <p>Qucung Qalavangan, the Deputy Minister of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, said that as more indigenous people move to cities each year, it is urgent to create public spaces and cultural festival areas for them. He hopes this ritual square will be finished on time and to a high standard, giving indigenous people in New Taipei City a good place to keep their culture alive.</p>

            <h1>Hikers Rarely See Mother and Cub Bears in Yushan National Park, a Main Home for Taiwan Black Bears</h1>
            <p>Yushan National Park is a place where many Taiwan black bears live. Recently, hikers saw a mother bear and her cub on the Walami Trail in Hualien County. The hikers told the Yushan National Park Management Office about it. The office said that visitors going on the Walami Trail can borrow bear bells from the Nanan Visitor Center.</p>
            <p>Yushan National Park is one of Taiwan's richest protected areas for wild animals and their homes. It is also the only known place where many Taiwan black bears, a special type of bear found only in Taiwan, live closely together. In recent years, there have been more reports of bear sightings, especially on the Walami Trail in the eastern part of the park. The Yushan National Park Management Office reminds people to hike with friends and use bear bells to avoid surprising a bear.</p>
            <p>The Yushan National Park Management Office said on its Facebook page today that to help people better understand black bears and how to live with them, they asked the Taiwan Wild One Wildlife Conservation Association to create a puzzle game. This game teaches about protecting bears, helping injured animals, and how to behave around wild animals. Staff members recently tried this game at the Nanan Management Station in Zhuoxi Township, Hualien County, and had a lot of fun.</p>
            <p>The Yushan National Park Management Office said that shortly after the puzzle game event, some hikers reported seeing Taiwan black bears on the Walami Trail. It was a rare sight of a mother and cub. After the hikers saw them, the mother and cub quickly left the area. This sighting matched what we already know about how black bears behave.</p>
            <p>The office advises that if visitors see a black bear in the mountains, they should not get too excited and go close to take pictures. Especially if you see a cub, the mother bear might think humans are a danger to her baby. This could bother the bears or even make the mother and cub separate. So, if you suddenly see a Taiwan black bear, stay calm and leave quietly. Do not stay around or take photos and share them online. This helps prevent danger and bad effects on the bears.</p>
            <p>The Yushan National Park Management Office also said that Taiwan black bears eat many different things and have a good sense of smell. When you go into the mountains, you should properly take care of your food. Make sure to keep food waste and trash safely and take them back down the mountain. This stops bears from coming near trails or cabins to find food, which can increase the chance of problems between humans and bears.</p>

            <h1>Two People Confirmed Dead, Three Still Missing After Car Falls on Southern Cross-Island Highway; Prosecutors Will Ask Court to Declare Them Dead</h1>
            <p>On Taiwan's Southern Cross-Island Highway (Route 20), a car with five family members fell into a valley. Police and firefighters searched for almost two weeks and found the bodies of Mr. Li and his wife's daughter, Ms. Pan. Today, prosecutors in Qiaotou said they have given death certificates to the family. They also helped the family get the bodies back. For the other three people who are still missing, the prosecutors will ask the court to officially declare them dead.</p>
            <p>The Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office stated at noon that on August 1st, they received a report from the Liugui Police Station in Kaohsiung about Ms. Pan's death. Investigations showed that at 9:28 PM on July 30th, Mr. Li was driving his car with his wife, Ms. Wu, their son, daughter, and Ms. Pan's daughter. While driving on the Southern Cross-Island Highway, Route 20, at the 81.1-kilometer mark in Taoyuan District, heavy rain caused the road to collapse. This led to the car falling into the valley.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Prosecutor Hsu Ya-wen and a forensic doctor checked some of the bodies at the Kaohsiung City Funeral Parlor. They collected DNA to confirm the identities of Mr. Li and Ms. Pan. Today, August 26th, death certificates were given to the families at the Kaohsiung City Funeral Parlor, where the bodies are kept. They also arranged with the funeral parlor for the families to take the bodies home on the same day, so the families would not have to travel a lot.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors added that the Kaohsiung City Fire Department announced the search and rescue ended on August 12th. The bodies of the other three missing people have not been found yet. The prosecutors have gotten permission from the families and gathered all the necessary evidence. They will quickly ask the Qiaotou District Court to declare the three people officially dead, following the rules of the Disaster Prevention and Relief Act. This will help the legal process move forward smoothly.</p>
