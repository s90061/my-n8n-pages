            <h1>EU Commission Head Goes to Scotland to Talk Trade with Trump</h1>
            <p>A spokesperson for the European Union Commission said that its head, Ursula von der Leyen, went to Scotland today. She plans to meet with US President Donald Trump tomorrow afternoon. European officials said that Europe and the US are close to making a trade deal.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump arrived in Scotland last night. He told reporters that he was looking forward to meeting with von der Leyen. He also called her a "respected" leader. Trump will stay in Scotland for a few days to play golf and have talks with others.</p>
            <p>Trump repeated his opinion that there is a 50% chance the US and the EU, which has 27 member countries, will make a basic trade agreement. He also said Brussels "really wants" to make a deal.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that if the US and Europe reach an agreement, it would be the biggest trade deal signed during his time as president. He added that it would be even bigger than the $550 billion deal made with Japan earlier this week.</p>
            <p>The White House has not shared details about this meeting. They also have not said what the possible agreement would include.</p>
            <p>EU diplomats said that the trade deal Washington and Brussels might agree on could involve a 15% tax on EU goods going to the US. This would be similar to the deal with Japan. It could also include a 50% tax on European steel and aluminum.</p>

            <h1>Aid Ship 'Handala' Nears Gaza, Israeli Army Says It Will Stop It</h1>
            <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition announced today that its aid ship, recently sent to the Gaza Strip, is getting close to the area. It is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. This action is to protest Israel's blockade.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the aid ship is named after Handala, a famous Palestinian cartoon character. It is now only 194 kilometers from its goal. This is closer to Gaza than another ship from the group, "Madleen," was when it was stopped in June.</p>
            <p>The Israeli navy stated that it will prevent the "Handala" ship from reaching Gaza.</p>
            <p>An Israeli army spokesperson told AFP today that the army "is carrying out legal sea safety blockade actions in the Gaza area. It is also ready for any situation and will act according to political orders."</p>
            <p>The "Handala" ship carries 19 activists and 2 journalists from different countries. It started its journey from Sicily on July 13. Its purpose is to break Israel's blockade of Gaza and provide help to the people there.</p>
            <p>The crew members of the "Handala" posted on social media X that if the Israeli army stops the ship and holds the people on board, they will start a hunger strike.</p>
