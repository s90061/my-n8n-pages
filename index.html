            <h1>US Equal Tariffs Start; Chen Chi-mai Calls for Continued Talks and Rethinking Industry Plan</h1>
            <p>The United States has started applying "equal tariffs," which means Taiwan will face an extra 20% temporary tariff on top of existing ones. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai said he hopes the government will continue to talk with the US. He also wants them to rethink how industries are set up to make sure Taiwan stays strong in this new tariff situation.</p>
            <p>Today, Chen Chi-mai went to the "2025 Cijin Kite Festival Opening Event." Before the event, he spoke to the media about the tariffs. He explained that Kaohsiung's main industries are petrochemicals and steel. For steel, items like screws and fasteners are under a special rule (Section 232). These items have faced a 50% tariff since March this year, which is the same for all countries. However, this also affects Taiwan's ability to compete with other markets.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai mentioned that it is worrying that China is selling steel products cheaply to Europe and Southeast Asia. This will definitely make it harder for Taiwan to sell its screws and fasteners abroad. He hopes the government will create good plans to help and support the screw and fastener industry.</p>
            <p>Regarding engine parts, Chen Chi-mai said that Kaohsiung produces about 15% to 20% of the country's total engine parts for export. These parts will have the extra tariffs, which will affect them a lot. He hopes the government can continue talking with the US.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai stressed that the government must think about America's plan to bring industries back and how global supply chains are changing. They need to rethink industry plans to make sure Taiwan's industries stay strong even with the extra tariffs. He hopes the government will offer more help and support to Kaohsiung's traditional industries.</p>

            <h1>Chikungunya Outbreak in Foshan, Guangdong Slows Down; Daily New Cases Decrease</h1>
            <p>The Chikungunya outbreak in Foshan, Guangdong, China is slowing down. Officials announced today that the highest number of new cases in a single day was 674. Yesterday, there were 148 new cases. Since July 29, the number of new cases has been going down.</p>
            <p>According to CCTV News on August 9, officials in Foshan, Guangdong, held a press conference this afternoon to talk about the Chikungunya outbreak (which China calls "Jikongkenya fever").</p>
            <p>Officials said that the number of new cases each day dropped from a peak of 674 on July 19 to 148 on August 8. The number has been going down since July 29. For the last five days in a row, the number of new cases has been less than 200, and fewer villages are reporting cases. This shows that the control efforts are starting to work.</p>
            <p>Officials emphasized that in this outbreak, there have been no serious cases or deaths in Foshan. More than 90% of patients have now recovered. They will continue to use resources to treat patients. They will also provide good treatment and care plans for older people, children, pregnant women, and patients with long-term illnesses, who are at higher risk.</p>
            <p>Officials also noted that since July 23, the number of mosquitoes in Foshan, Guangdong, has been below a safe level for 17 days in a row.</p>
            <p>Foshan, Guangdong, has been the area most affected by this outbreak. On August 7, Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced one imported case of Chikungunya. A Taiwanese woman in her 40s visited friends in Foshan and Shenzhen, Guangdong. After returning to Taiwan on July 30, she had symptoms like fever and rash. Tests showed she had the disease, but she has now recovered and left the hospital.</p>
            <p>On August 5, the CDC announced that they raised the travel health warning for Guangdong, China, from Level 1 "Watch" to Level 2 "Alert." The CDC stated that the Chikungunya outbreak in Guangdong, China, is serious, especially in Foshan. They remind people planning to travel to Guangdong, China, or other areas where Chikungunya is common, to take steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites.</p>

            <h1>Reports: Trump Orders US Military to Strike Drug Cartels; Mexican President Says There Will Be No Invasion</h1>
            <p>Media reports say that US President Donald Trump has told the US military to act against drug groups in Latin America. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said today, "Mexico will not be invaded."</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that Trump has secretly signed an order allowing the use of military force against drug groups that the US government has called terrorist organizations. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Sheinbaum said, "Mexico will not be invaded."</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum said at her morning meeting, "We were told that this executive order would be announced. It does not involve any military personnel or organizations working on our land."</p>
            <p>Mexico's foreign ministry later stated that Mexico "will not accept the US military acting on our land."</p>
            <p>Before this, the US Embassy in Mexico said in a statement that both countries will use "all possible ways to protect our people" from drug groups.</p>
            <p>Ronald Johnson, the US Ambassador to Mexico, said on X (formerly Twitter) that both countries "face a common enemy: violent crime groups."</p>
            <p>The Pentagon suggested asking the White House about this, but the White House did not quickly confirm the order.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that Trump's order gives a reason for military actions against drug groups at sea or in other countries.</p>
            <p>In February, Trump's government said that eight drug groups were terrorist organizations. Six of them were from Mexico, and one each was from Venezuela and El Salvador.</p>
            <p>Two weeks ago, Trump's government also named Venezuela's "Cartel of the Suns" a terrorist organization. For over 20 years, this group has brought hundreds of tons of drugs into the United States.</p>
