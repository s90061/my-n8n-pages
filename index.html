(Taipei News Agency Reporter Huang Qiaowen, July 15) A scholar said that older drivers, 75 years and above, are 2.44 times more likely to cause pedestrian deaths than drivers aged 41 to 64. They asked for support plans when improving rules for older drivers. The Ministry of Transportation said they are working on 4 ways to improve. This includes giving money for TPASS cards to older people who willingly give back their driving licenses.

On May 19 this year, a big car accident happened outside Beida Elementary School in Sanxia District, New Taipei City. The driver who caused the accident was 78 years old. This brought attention to the topic of older drivers. Today, the Health and Welfare Policy Research Center of Taipei Medical University held a meeting called "Is the Policy for Older Drivers Good? Balancing Road Safety and Older People's Freedom to Move."

Zhang Yaohui, who is a deputy group leader in the Road Supervision Department of the Ministry of Transportation's Highway Bureau, said that Taiwan is becoming a very old society. They think that in 10 years, the number of people aged 70 and above who have a driver's license will go up from 1.826 million to 2.72 million.

In May, the Ministry of Transportation said they are thinking about changing the age for older drivers to renew their licenses from 75 to 70. Minister Chen Shih-kai had said that detailed plans would be ready in 3 months and they hope to start the new rules for older drivers next year. Zhang Yaohui said that to talk with older people, the Ministry of Transportation held more than 20 talks at temples in different cities and counties across the country. The goal of these talks is not to take away older people's licenses but to help them drive safely and to check on them early at age 70.

Professor Bai Zhiwei from the Institute of Injury Prevention and Control at Taipei Medical University said that his research team looked at over 426,000 car accident cases from the police records between 2011 and 2023. The study found that older drivers aged 75 and above caused the most pedestrian deaths among all age groups. They were 2.44 times more likely to cause pedestrian deaths than drivers aged 41 to 64. Also, the older the driver, the higher the risk of serious injury or death for pedestrians.

However, Bai Zhiwei pointed out that the Ministry of Transportation started a system in 2017 to manage license renewals for older drivers. The main goal was to keep older drivers safe and to keep all road users safe. But looking at the numbers, the effect has been small. For example, the number of accidents caused by drivers aged 65-74 and 75 and above has not gone down much.

As society gets older, Bai Zhiwei believes that older drivers' eyesight, reaction time, and thinking skills get worse. This also affects their ability to make decisions. Even though the system for managing older drivers hasn't shown much effect yet, he thinks it's going in the right direction and is needed.

Bai Zhiwei suggested that the government should make road environments better, for example, by adding left-turn signals at intersections and building traffic islands. Also, public transportation should be more common to make it easier for older people to travel. This would make older people less dependent on their own cars.

Regarding Bai Zhiwei's suggestion that the government should have support plans when thinking about how to improve the system for older drivers, Zhang Yaohui said that to help older people drive safely, they are planning to improve in 4 ways. These include reviewing the health check and thinking skill tests, making sure drivers complete traffic safety courses before renewing their licenses, making drivers who have caused accidents or broken rules complete practical training, and encouraging older people to willingly give back their licenses by giving them money for TPASS cards.

Zhang Yaohui said that besides the existing "Happy Bus" and "Happy Taxi" services, they are encouraging older drivers to give back their licenses by giving them money for TPASS cards. This plan would let them use all kinds of public transportation, and even taxis. (Editor: Li Shuhua) 1140715

***Central Taiwan Urban Resilience Drill: Premier Cho Jung-tai Says to Make People More Aware of Self-Defense***

(Taipei News Agency Reporter Zhao Liyen, Taichung, July 15) Today, the central Taiwan area held an urban air defense resilience drill. Premier Cho Jung-tai hopes that the 12,000 people taking part will be like seeds spreading out. Through this drill, he wants to awaken and strengthen people's awareness of self-defense. He said that a strong society is everyone's job, and no one can stay out of it.

Premier Cho Jung-tai went to the "2025 Urban Resilience Drill" in Taichung today. He watched how the first aid station and relief station worked. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen led the team that planned the drill. Premier Cho said that this urban resilience drill combines the Civilian Peace, Wan An, and Han Kuang drills. It is the first large-scale, real, unscripted drill that tests everyone's ability to react to different sudden situations.

Premier Cho praised the careful planning of the event and the realistic drill situations, which made him feel emotional. He said that the drill is not just about gaining personal experience; it is also a deeper responsibility for the country. The government will use all means and all its power to make sure Taiwanese people are not challenged or harmed. He also said that when natural disasters and challenges come, being prepared can make people safer.

Premier Cho mentioned that world events are changing quickly. Being in the first line of defense in terms of where we are in the world, it is hard to stay out of various international changes. And Taiwan is an important place and player for safety, peace, and stability in the world. We can only start by being strong by ourselves.

He said that when something happens, everyone should know where it is safe and where they can get help. Government workers, volunteers, and the military have big responsibilities. When something happens, they need to know where to stand to do their duty for the country and protect the people. This is the most important spirit that should be shown in the drill.

Premier Cho hopes that these 12,000 civilian volunteers will be like seeds that spread out. He also said they will use more technology to improve the drill's ability to react, strengthen cooperation between different government departments, and build cybersecurity. All these things will be gradually improved after the drill.

He said that reducing disasters and stopping them is a shared responsibility of the central and local governments. Making the whole society stronger and safer is everyone's shared responsibility. No one can stay out of it; everyone must help each other and make themselves stronger. Under the President's leadership, the central and local governments will work together fully to protect our safety.

Lu Shiow-yen mentioned that Taiwan might face the risk of war. Also, due to extreme weather, there might be many disasters. She said that central and local governments, along with the public, should prepare beforehand and work with private groups to strengthen drills. This way, when war comes, they can protect families and people. The Taichung City Government will fully support the central government's policies and requests to protect our homes and country.

This shows how important the friendship between Taiwan and Paraguay is. This visit to Paraguay is not only to celebrate 68 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, but also to bring business representatives from industries like semiconductors, information and communication technology, construction, smart agriculture, high-tech fabrics, green energy, furniture, and food processing. These industries have good chances to work with Paraguay.

President Peña also pointed out that Paraguay's economy is growing steadily and has a great environment for investment. He hopes Taiwanese companies will learn more about Paraguay's potential for growth and take advantage of these chances. (Editor: Lin Hsing-meng) 1140715
