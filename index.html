Paul Biya, the 92-year-old President of Cameroon, has announced he will run for an eighth term in the elections set for October. He has been in power for 43 years already. President Biya shared this news on social media, writing in both French and English. He said he is still very determined to serve the country and face its challenges. Biya is the main candidate for his party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement. Even though some people who used to support him have left his side recently, the opposing political parties are not working together, which makes it hard for them to pick one candidate.

**Former Nigerian President Buhari Dies in London at 82**

Muhammadu Buhari, who used to be the President of Nigeria, has died in London. He was 82 years old. Buhari led Nigeria first as a military leader in the 1980s. Later, he became an elected president, serving two terms from 2015 to 2023. His spokesperson shared that he passed away in a clinic in London. Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, has expressed his sadness and is making arrangements for Buhari's body to return home. In 2015, Buhari made history by being the first opposition candidate to win an election against a president who was already in office. However, during his time as president, he could not solve the country's problems with corruption and safety, and Nigeria's economy became worse.
