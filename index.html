            <h1>6 Out of 7 Party Leaders in Legislature Are Missing; Green Party Says: We Have Talent, Waiting for People Who Want to Help</h1>
            <p>The new session of the Legislative Yuan will start in mid-September. However, no one has signed up to be a leader in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) group in the parliament. Hsu Kuo-yung, the Secretary-General of the DPP, said today that the DPP always has many capable people. He believes that new leaders will appear when the time is right. DPP Legislator Wu Szu-yao said that everyone is responsible for improving the party's group in the parliament. She is waiting for people who want to help to step up. She also called on older, more experienced members to take on these roles.</p>
            <p>Before this, Wu Szu-yao, who was the main secretary, and Chen Pei-yu, who was the party group secretary, had resigned. Four other deputy secretaries also resigned. This means that out of seven main leaders, only the Convener, Ko Chien-ming, is left. On September 1st, the DPP group sent letters to all DPP lawmakers to ask if they wanted to be the main secretary or party group secretary. But in the end, no one signed up.</p>
            <p>On September 6th, the DPP started a series of meetings in 22 cities and counties across the country. President Lai Ching-te, who is also the DPP Chairperson, visited Tianhou Temple in Hsinchu City this morning. Ko Chien-ming was with him the whole time. When President Lai arrived, he shook hands and spoke friendly words with Ko Chien-ming as soon as he got out of the car. Their interaction looked natural.</p>
            <p>There were rumors that some in the party wanted to force Ko Chien-ming to step down. Hsu Kuo-yung, who was with President Lai, said in an interview, "Silence is more powerful than words." About the parliament starting soon and no one signing up for leadership roles, he repeated that the DPP always has many capable people, and they will appear when it's time.</p>
            <p>DPP Legislator Wu Szu-yao told a reporter that there are many professional and capable people who have more experience than her. She thinks people don't want these jobs because being a leader is very tiring and stressful. For lawmakers who represent a specific area, it's even harder because they have to manage their time, work in their area, and also become targets for criticism. She understands these difficulties.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said that improving the party's group in the parliament is everyone's job, and they are all waiting for people who want to help. There is still some time before the parliament starts, and they will keep asking for volunteers. She explained that the parliament's environment is more divided now, and political arguments are more intense. Lawmakers who want to run for city or county mayor positions want to focus on their local areas and prepare for elections. They hope to avoid too much negative attention, and she understands this.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao pointed out that in the last term, the DPP had the most seats in the parliament. But now, they have to work hard through many challenges, which will be a huge test. She has experienced the high pressure herself. She did not name anyone specifically, but she called on all older and more experienced members to take on these responsibilities.</p>
            <p>DPP Legislator Chung Chia-pin told a reporter that people are watching what the party group will do next. Hsu Kuo-yung used Ko Chien-ming's words, "Silence is more powerful than words," to respond cleverly. He thinks that choosing the party group leaders is like preparing a banquet. The most important thing is that the dishes taste good. "As for when the dishes will be served? They will be served when all the guests are seated."</p>

            <h1>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba Resigns and Will Not Run in the Next Party Election</h1>
            <p>Tonight, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held a press conference to say he is resigning. He said that because trade talks about tariffs with the United States are finished, it is the right time to leave his job. Ishiba is also the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). When reporters asked if he would run in the next election for the LDP leader, he clearly said, "I will not run."</p>
            <p>Ishiba announced his resignation tonight at the Prime Minister's office. He said he has always believed in not holding onto power too much. He thinks that after finishing what needs to be done, one should decide at the right moment. He also said before that the leader is responsible for election results. Now that the talks with the U.S. about tariffs are over, it is the "right time." So, he has decided to "make way for a new person to take over."</p>
            <p>On September 2nd, Ishiba admitted at a big meeting of both houses of the parliament that he should take responsibility for the LDP's loss in the July Upper House election. Regarding when he would resign, he said he would "decide at the right time."</p>
            <p>Since Ishiba announced his resignation tonight, the ruling LDP will hold an election to choose a new party leader. Usually, the LDP leader serves for three years. Ishiba became the leader last September, so his term could have lasted until September 2027.</p>
            <p>At tonight's press conference, when reporters asked if he would run in the LDP leadership election, Ishiba clearly said, "I will not run."</p>
            <p>The LDP will decide how the upcoming leadership election will be held. If it's a full election, there will be 295 votes from lawmakers and 295 votes from party members, making a total of 590 votes. This type of election takes more than 12 days. If it's a simpler election, there will be 295 votes from lawmakers and 141 votes from local areas (3 votes from each of the 47 prefectures), totaling 436 votes.</p>
            <p>After the LDP lost badly in the Upper House election on July 20th, Ishiba felt pressure to resign. This is because before the election, he said the goal was for the LDP and its partner party, Komeito, to win more than half of the seats, but they did not reach this goal. Also, the LDP lost in the Lower House election at the end of last year. Because of these losses, more people in the LDP started blaming Ishiba.</p>
            <p>About one and a half months have passed since the big loss in the Upper House election, and Ishiba delayed his resignation. People thought this was "dragging things out." This delay caused talks between the LDP and other parties about policies to slow down. A situation where there was no clear political leadership continued.</p>
            <p>Currently, the LDP is a minority ruling party. This means they do not have more than half of the seats in both the Lower and Upper Houses of parliament. So, the new LDP leader might not necessarily be chosen as Prime Minister when the parliament names a Prime Minister. How the new LDP leader works with other parties will be a big challenge.</p>
