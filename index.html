            <h1>Myanmar Earthquake Reconstruction: Mustard Seed Association Starts Long-term Material Aid</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 31, Central News Agency) A strong earthquake hit Myanmar in March. More than 3,000 people died. The Christian Mustard Seed Association has been helping people. They have sent many groups of emergency supplies by air. They plan to give supplies for at least one year. They hope to help families in the affected areas live normal lives for a long time.</p>
            <p>On March 28, the strongest earthquake in 100 years happened in Sagaing Province, Myanmar. Over 3,000 people died, and thousands were hurt. More than 50,000 people lost their homes and had to move. The areas have not been rebuilt yet.</p>
            <p>The Christian Mustard Seed Association said in a press release today that they follow the idea of "helping people." Right after the earthquake, they started the "Myanmar Helping Network" plan. This plan includes giving emergency help, hot meals, and setting up centers for children. It also includes "work for recovery" and rebuilding important buildings. They work with local groups in Myanmar to follow their idea of helping people. They continue to show Taiwan's love and care in the affected areas.</p>
            <p>The Mustard Seed Association said that in the first month after the earthquake, they sent 4 tons of emergency supplies by air. These supplies included tents, sleeping bags, milk powder, diapers, canned food, and medical things. They sent these to shelters and orphanages in the Mandalay area. This helped people and children with their immediate needs. They also gave 3,200 hot meals every day and continue to give 500 hot meals daily to families. This helps people get enough food.</p>
            <p>Also, the Mustard Seed Association said that to keep giving supplies, they sent daily items by sea in three groups starting from June 18. These items included mattresses, bedding, and 768 boxes, nearly 10 tons, of Japanese cooking oil. These were sent on July 16. All supplies were sent to the Mandalay disaster area. They plan to give supplies for at least one year, or four seasons. They hope to help families in the affected areas live normal lives for a long time.</p>
            <p>Besides short-term help, the Mustard Seed Association also works with local groups in Myanmar to open "Homes of Hope" for children. They are now taking care of 33 children who lost their parents. They give them a safe place to live and help them with their education. They also set up supply stations to continue giving daily items and school supplies. They also started a "work for recovery" plan. They hire people from the affected areas to help take care of the children, manage supplies, and do repairs. This helps them get money again and live on their own.</p>
            <p>For rebuilding, the Mustard Seed Association will also help build 150 strong, temporary grass houses. They will also build 13 wells for drinking water in the communities. This will make living conditions better. At the same time, in the Mandalay area, they helped 10 families repair their homes. They also gave 150 sets of desks and chairs to 3 primary schools. This helps children go back to school.</p>
            <p>Li Chao-chia, the head of the Mustard Seed Association, said that they saw a lot of damage in the disaster. But they also saw a chance to rebuild. They will continue to stay with the people affected by the earthquake in Myanmar. They want to make sure hope grows even in hard times. By giving care, education, and job chances, they hope to help people become independent and feel confident and hopeful about the future again.</p>

            <h1>Macao Police Arrest Former Pro-Democracy Lawmaker Au Kam-san, Accused of National Security Law Violations</h1>
            <p>(Hong Kong, July 31, Central News Agency) Yesterday, the Macao Judiciary Police arrested a 68-year-old man with the last name Au. They said he might have broken the law about national security. Reports say the man arrested is Au Kam-san, a former lawmaker who supported democracy in Macao.</p>
            <p>This might be the first time someone in Macao has been arrested for possibly breaking the national security law.</p>
            <p>Today, the Macao Judiciary Police gave details about the case. They said the arrested man might have worked with an "anti-China" group outside Macao since 2022. He is thought to have given this group a lot of false and misleading information. This information was used by the group for public display outside Macao and online. Even after the new national security law started in 2023, he continued to let the group use this information to keep their activities going.</p>
            <p>The police also said the arrested man might have often contacted many "anti-China" groups outside Macao for a long time. He is thought to have given false information about Macao to these groups or their media. This was for spreading messages. The police claim this was done "to make people in Macao and even people in other countries who don't know the truth hate our central government and the Macao Special Administrative Region government, to harm the 2024 Macao Chief Executive election and to cause other countries to act against Macao."</p>
            <p>According to "Hong Kong 01," an online news website, the arrested man is Au Kam-san, a former pro-democracy lawmaker in Macao.</p>
            <p>Macao's national security law started in 2009. It was changed and updated in 2023.</p>

            <h1>US Just Allowed H20 to Be Sold to China; Chinese Officials Interview Nvidia About Chip Security Issues</h1>
            <p>(Beijing, July 31, Central News Agency) US President Trump and his team have decided to let Nvidia sell its H20 computer chips to China. But today, China's Cyberspace Administration (CAC) met with Nvidia. They asked Nvidia to explain problems with the H20 chip's security, like possible weaknesses or hidden access points. They also asked for related documents. This makes it unclear if the H20 chips will be sold to China.</p>
            <p>China's Cyberspace Administration (CAC) announced that recently, Nvidia chips were found to have serious security problems. Before this, American lawmakers asked that advanced chips from the US must have a "tracking" feature. Experts in artificial intelligence from the US also said that Nvidia's powerful chips already have technology for "tracking" and "turning off from a distance."</p>
            <p>The announcement said that to protect the internet and data security of Chinese users, the CAC met with Nvidia on July 31. This was done according to laws like the "Cybersecurity Law," "Data Security Law," and "Personal Information Protection Law." The CAC asked Nvidia to explain the security risks of the H20 chips sold to China, including any weaknesses or hidden access points. They also asked for proof.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that two weeks ago, Nvidia said they were asking the US government to allow them to sell their H20 graphics chips (GPUs) to China again. The US government had told Nvidia that they would get permission soon.</p>
            <p>On July 29, Kevin Hassett, a US White House economic advisor, also said that President Trump and his team had decided to let Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chips go to China. This was to stop China from getting too far ahead in making the best chips. Now, because Chinese officials have met with Nvidia, it is not certain if the H20 chips will be sent to China.</p>
