            <h1>Kaohsiung City Funeral Parlor Finds 14 Blank Prop Gun Shells, Man Targeted for Investigation</h1>
            <p>On July 21st, some people found what looked like bullet casings at the Kaohsiung City Funeral Parlor. The police came to check. They confirmed that there were 14 casings. Police believe they are blank shells for prop guns used in movies. They have no primer and cannot fire. Police and prosecutors are now looking for a man.</p>
            <p>Officers from Kaohsiung City Police Departmentâ€™s Sanmin Second Division said they received a report around 8 AM. Crime scene investigators arrived to check and collect evidence. They found 14 casings. After a first look, they saw that these empty casings did not have a primer and could not fire. They think these are blank shells for prop guns used in filming.</p>
            <p>Police checked nearby security cameras and found a suspect. It was a man who seemed to take the casings out of his pocket and throw them on the ground. The police have asked the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation into this act of throwing away casings, which might be a public threat. They will find and arrest the man for suspected public intimidation.</p>

            <h1>Israeli Army Opens Fire Near Aid Station, 93 More Deaths in Gaza</h1>
            <p>The Gaza Civil Defense Department reported that on July 20th, Israeli soldiers shot at a group of Palestinians trying to get humanitarian aid in the war-damaged Palestinian area. This caused 93 deaths and injured dozens of people.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, 80 people were shot when aid trucks arrived in northern Gaza. Another 9 people were shot near an aid station in Rafah in the south. This happened just 24 hours after dozens of people died in the same place from Israeli gunfire.</p>
            <p>Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for the Gaza Civil Defense Department, said that 4 people died near an aid station in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza.</p>
            <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) stated that a convoy of 25 trucks carrying food aid, soon after crossing the Israeli border and passing a checkpoint, "met large groups of hungry people who were then shot at" near Gaza City.</p>
            <p>The Israeli military did not agree with the number of deaths. They said thousands of people gathered near Gaza City at the time, and the Israeli soldiers fired warning shots "to remove the immediate danger they faced."</p>
            <p>In Gaza City, Qasem Abu Khater, 36, told reporters that he ran to get a bag of flour but found thousands of very hungry people there. He said, "the deadly crowd pushed each other."</p>
            <p>He added, "Tanks fired at us without aim, and Israeli snipers shot at us, like hunting animals in a forest... Dozens died in front of my eyes, and no one could save anyone."</p>
            <p>The World Food Programme strongly criticized the violence against civilians looking for help, saying it was "completely unacceptable."</p>

            <h1>Wang Kuan-hung Not Satisfied with Universiade 200m Butterfly Silver, Will Turn Regret into Motivation</h1>
            <p>On July 21st, "Taiwan's Butterfly King" Wang Kuan-hung won a silver medal in the men's 200-meter butterfly final at the Rhine-Ruhr Universiade. His time was 1 minute 55.85 seconds, just 0.26 seconds behind the gold medal winner. He said he was "very unsatisfied" and hopes to use this feeling of regret to move forward.</p>
            <p>The gold medal was won by American swimmer Jack Dahlgren with a time of 1 minute 55.59 seconds. Another American swimmer, Mason Laur, won the bronze medal with 1 minute 56.50 seconds.</p>
            <p>At the last World University Games in Chengdu, Taiwanese swimmer Wang Kuan-hung won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly. This time, after two years, he returned to the Universiade stage. In the 200-meter butterfly semi-finals, he was ranked first and moved on to the final. His goal was to get a better medal and win Taiwan's first-ever swimming gold medal.</p>
            <p>However, in the 200-meter butterfly final today, Wang Kuan-hung's performance was not as good as in the semi-finals. But he still tried his best with every move. In the last 50 meters, he pushed hard and almost made a comeback, but he missed the gold medal by 0.26 seconds. Even so, winning silver medals in two consecutive Universiades in the very competitive swimming event makes Wang Kuan-hung the first person from Taiwan to do so.</p>
            <p>After the competition, Wang Kuan-hung spoke to reporters. He said that compared to his first Universiade two years ago, he felt much calmer this time. But because he wanted to get the best result, he was very unsatisfied with his performance in the final and felt upset. He said, "My goal was to get the team's first gold medal. But for Taiwan's swimming to be on the podium at an international competition is already something to be proud of."</p>
            <p>Wang Kuan-hung will remember missing the gold medal this time. He hopes to use this feeling as motivation to move forward and win the gold medal at the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games. He said, "Thank you to my family and friends for cheering me on. I believe this competition will be good for my progress as I aim for my biggest goal, the Asian Games next year."</p>
