            <h1>Trump Meets with Marcos: US and Philippines are Close to a Trade Deal</h1>
            <p>Today, on July 22nd, US President Donald Trump welcomed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House. They had a meeting. Trump said they would talk about trade and other topics. He mentioned, "We are very close to finishing a trade agreement." Trump also said that Marcos is a very tough person to negotiate with.</p>
            <p>Marcos is the first leader from Southeast Asia to meet Trump since Trump became president again. Since Trump started putting equal taxes on goods in early April, the US has already made trade deals with Vietnam and Indonesia. These are two other countries in Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>Today, in the Oval Office at the White House, Trump and Marcos met. Trump told the media that they would talk about trade, war, and peace. He said that the Philippines is a very important country for military matters. He also noted that the US and the Philippines recently had "some great military exercises."</p>
            <p>Trump also stated, "We are very close to finishing a trade agreement." But he did not share more details about it.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked how close they were to finishing the deal, Trump only replied that Marcos is "a very tough negotiator." He added that they haven't finished the deal yet "because he (Marcos) has been too tough in the talks."</p>
            <p>However, Trump also said, "We might agree on some things."</p>
            <p>The Philippines is an important friend of the United States in Asia. The government in Manila hopes to get a better trade agreement before the deadline on August 1st.</p>
            <p>Foreign news reports say that last year, the US bought 5 billion US dollars more goods from the Philippines than the Philippines bought from the US. The total amount of goods traded between the two countries was 23.5 billion US dollars. Earlier this month, Trump sent a letter about taxes to Marcos. It said that from August 1st, the taxes on goods from the Philippines coming to the US would increase. They would go from 17% (which was suggested in April) to 20%.</p>

            <h1>EU Official: China is Watching US and Europe's Actions; Ukraine War Affects Taiwan Strait</h1>
            <p>Andrius Kubilius, who is an EU official for defense, recently said that it is very important for Europe and the United States to show they are united in helping Ukraine. He stated that Europe's ability to protect Ukraine "will surely affect what China decides to do about Taiwan."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Kubilius visited Washington D.C. He said that Russia cannot compete with the US and its European friends economically. The difficult part is how to make these friends work together and give strong, planned support to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Kubilius also said, "We must understand that if we put together the economic power of the US and Europe, our total is about 20 times more than Russia's. What we need is political will."</p>
            <p>He told reporters that Russia is not the only country watching how the US and its friends handle this invasion. Leaders in Beijing are also watching the war in Ukraine very closely. They are using it to guess how the world might react if Taiwan is attacked.</p>
            <p>Kubilius said, "We must clearly show our support for Ukraine. China is watching."</p>
            <p>The Kyiv Post reported that when Kubilius was in Washington D.C., he stressed that the conflict in Ukraine has bigger effects on world politics. He said that Europe's ability to protect Ukraine "will surely affect what China decides to do about Taiwan."</p>
