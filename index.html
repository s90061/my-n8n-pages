            <h1>Zelensky Says Mercenaries from China and Other Countries Are Fighting for Russia, Will Take Action</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelensky said today that Ukrainian soldiers in the northeast part of the country are fighting against foreign "mercenaries." These mercenaries are from several countries, including China, Pakistan, and parts of Africa. He promised to deal with this situation.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelensky had previously said that Moscow was hiring Chinese people to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine. However, China said this was not true. North Korea has also sent thousands of soldiers to Russia's Kursk region to help in the fighting.</p>
            <p>After visiting a front-line area in Ukraine's Kharkiv region in the northeast, Zelensky wrote on social media platform X: "We talked with our commanders about the situation at the front line, how we are defending Vovchansk, and how the fighting is going."</p>
            <p>He also said: "Our soldiers in this area told us that mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries are taking part in this war. We will respond to this."</p>
            <p>Reuters has contacted the embassies of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, to ask for their comments on this matter.</p>
            <p>Russia has not yet officially commented on what Zelensky said.</p>

            <h1>Ha Ji-won's Agency Manager Stabbed to Death at Convenience Store; Suspect Detained</h1>
            <p>Zhan Zhineng, the general manager of the agency for Korean cheerleader Ha Ji-won, was stabbed to death today at a convenience store in Fengyuan District. The man involved, identified as Mr. Huang, was sent to the police station in the evening for murder charges. After further questioning, prosecutors in Taichung asked the court to detain him and not allow him to talk to others.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office stated that after questioning Mr. Huang, the prosecutor believes he is very likely guilty of murder. This is a serious crime that could mean more than 5 years in prison. There is a risk that he might run away, try to work with others, or destroy evidence. Therefore, it is necessary to hold him. The court has been asked to detain him and restrict his communication.</p>
            <p>This fatal incident happened at 10:27 AM. A man was hurt by a sharp object at a convenience store on Nanyang Road. The man showed no signs of life before arriving at the hospital. He had many knife wounds on his hands and feet and died from his serious injuries after doctors tried to save him. The Fengyuan Police Branch in Taichung asked the Taichung District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. In the afternoon, the prosecutor returned to the scene to look for clues and told Mr. Zhan's family to help with the examination of the body. To find out exactly how Mr. Zhan died, a date for an autopsy has been set.</p>
            <p>After police questioning, Mr. Huang was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office at 8:55 PM for more questions, facing murder charges. Mr. Huang had turned himself in wearing the bloody clothes from the crime. Because the blood-stained clothes were important evidence, Mr. Huang changed his clothes. When reporters asked him, "Why did you kill him?" and "What was the big problem?" Mr. Huang did not say anything. He sat in the police car, curled up in the back seat.</p>
