            <h1>Yang Po-han/Liu Kuang-heng Control Shouting, Advance to Men's Doubles Top 16 at Denmark Open</h1>
            <p>At the BWF Super 750 Denmark Badminton Open, Taiwan's men's doubles team, "Cold Flow Combination" Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng, managed their shouts in the first round of the top 32 today. They beat India's Roy and Pratheek with scores of 21-13, 21-17, successfully moving to the top 16.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng, ranked 22nd in the world, played against Roy (Pruthvi Krishnamurthy Roy) and Pratheek (K. Sai Pratheek), ranked 38th in the world, for the first time in their careers today.</p>
            <p>In the quarter-finals of last week's Arctic Open in Finland, Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng were playing against Malaysia's world No. 2 team. They were about to tie the score in the first game. However, they shouted in celebration before the shuttlecock landed. The main referee took points away, and they lost the first game, and eventually the match.</p>
            <p>Liu Kuang-heng laughed when talking to the Central News Agency reporter. He said, "Today, we paid more attention not to celebrate too early. But honestly, few players shout in celebration after the shuttlecock lands to encourage themselves. It all depends on the referee's opinion."</p>
            <p>In the first game today, both sides played very closely at the start, with seven ties. However, the Taiwanese team changed their tactics a bit during the technical break at 11-9. This worked well, and they won the first game.</p>
            <p>Liu Kuang-heng said, "The shuttlecock speed on this court is very fast, very different from the game in Finland last week. So, during the break, senior partner Po-han and I discussed playing with about 60-70% power. The main goal was to control the shuttlecock within our desired area, and it was quite successful."</p>
            <p>In the second game, Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng started strongly, leading 11-3. At one point, they had a double-digit lead of 13-3. Even though their opponents tried hard to catch up later, the Taiwanese team won easily.</p>
            <p>Liu Kuang-heng stressed, "We don't have a specific goal. We just want to win every match. Last week's loss was indeed a bit frustrating, so we hope to get a good result here in Denmark."</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Zone Starts for 3 Months; 34 Financial Companies Compete for Rich Clients</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung zone has been open for three months. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced the results today. A total of 34 financial institutions have joined the Kaohsiung zone to try out new services. Banks found family offices and working with investment trust and consulting firms to sell overseas funds (not like securities investment trust funds) to be popular. Insurance companies started 28 new contracts for wealth management products.</p>
            <p>The FSC wants Taiwan to become a major asset management center in Asia. The Kaohsiung Asset Management Zone (Kaohsiung Zone) started in July. Many financial companies are eager to get business from wealthy clients.</p>
            <p>Wang Yun-chung, Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Banking Bureau, said at a regular press conference that as of today, 17 banks have joined the Kaohsiung Zone. They applied to offer services like loans, family offices, and cross-border financial services. Looking at all the data, two main services are getting a lot of attention: first, family offices, and second, banks working with investment trust and consulting firms to sell overseas funds that are not like securities investment trust funds. This is the first time banks are trying this kind of cooperation, so many people are interested.</p>
            <p>In addition, Wang Yun-chung pointed out that bank loan services include self-guaranteed loans, insurance financing, and Lombard Lending (loans backed by financial assets). Many of these are new services, and many clients are asking about them.</p>
            <p>Ku Kun-jung, Chief Secretary of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said that five life insurance companies applied to the FSC to try new services in the zone. Currently, Cathay Life, Fubon Life, Nanshan Life, and KGI Life have been approved. The other one is still being reviewed.</p>
            <p>Ku Kun-jung explained that these companies mainly try wealth management and international insurance services. They offer insurance products that do not follow the rules for minimum death benefits on policy cash values for life insurance products. They also do joint marketing, promotion, or account opening with OSU (Offshore Securities Units), OBU (Offshore Banking Units), and OIU (Offshore Insurance Units).</p>
            <p>Ku Kun-jung noted that by the end of September, the Kaohsiung Zone had 28 new contracts for wealth management products. The zone's life insurance business mainly sells US dollar variable interest products and participating life insurance. The FSC continues to encourage more companies to join the zone.</p>
            <p>Huang Hou-ming, Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said that as of now, 10 investment trust and consulting firms and 3 securities firms have joined the Kaohsiung Zone. Investment trust and consulting firms mainly offer multi-channel services for overseas funds that are not like securities investment trust funds, selling two funds in total. The three securities firms do not have any business yet.</p>

            <h1>Chou Yu-kou Ordered to Pay NT$3.2 Million in Second Trial for Saying "CTi News is Backed by the Communist Party"</h1>
            <p>Tsai Eng-meng, chairman of Want Want China Times Group, and CTi News station sued media person Chou Yu-kou for calling CTi News a "red media" (media controlled by the Chinese Communist Party). The Taipei District Court had ordered Chou Yu-kou to pay NT$2.8 million for breaking their agreement. The Taiwan High Court today changed the decision, ordering Chou Yu-kou to pay NT$3.2 million. This decision can still be appealed.</p>
            <p>In 2017, Chou Yu-kou accused Tsai Eng-meng of being a "mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party," leading to a lawsuit. Both sides settled and dropped the lawsuit. However, in 2020, Chou Yu-kou again said things like "CTi News is backed by the Communist Party" and "Tsai Eng-meng respectfully reported to Wang Yi, who was then the director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and listened to his instructions."</p>
            <p>Tsai Eng-meng and CTi News believed that Chou Yu-kou's actions broke their previous settlement agreement. They filed a civil lawsuit asking for compensation. The Taipei District Court ruled that Chou Yu-kou should pay Tsai Eng-meng NT$800,000 and CTi News NT$2 million. Both sides appealed this decision.</p>
            <p>The High Court found that Chou Yu-kou's statements suggested that CTi News company had a close relationship with the Chinese Communist government, and Tsai Eng-meng had a close connection with and took orders from the Chinese Communist government. She did not provide proof that she asked Tsai Eng-meng or CTi News before making these statements. Therefore, this was a breach of their agreement, and she should pay punitive damages. The court ordered Chou Yu-kou to pay Tsai Eng-meng NT$800,000 and CTi News NT$2.4 million. This decision can still be appealed.</p>
