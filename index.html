            <h1>Trump to Meet Zelenskyy; White House Confirms Meeting on August 19th Early Morning Taiwan Time</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy and several European leaders will meet with US President Trump in Washington D.C. The White House announced that Trump will talk with Zelenskyy at 1:15 PM local time (1:15 AM on August 19th, Taiwan time). After that, he will meet with all the European leaders.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that leaders from the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Finland, along with the head of NATO, want to support Zelenskyy during this important time in the Russia-Ukraine war. They also want to stop a repeat of the argument between Trump and Zelenskyy that happened in the Oval Office in February this year.</p>
            <p>The White House stated that Trump will first meet with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office at 1:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time (1:15 AM on August 19th, Taiwan time). Then, at 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (3:00 AM on August 19th, Taiwan time), he will meet with all the European leaders in the White House East Room.</p>
            <p>On August 15th, Trump welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin with a red carpet at the US-Russia summit in Alaska. After that, he said an agreement should be made to end the war, which has been going on for three and a half years.</p>
            <p>However, Zelenskyy has mostly said no to Putin's suggestions made during the US-Russia summit. These suggestions included asking Ukraine to give up Donetsk, a region in the east. Ukraine still controls a quarter of Donetsk, while Russian forces control the rest.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy arrived in Washington D.C. late yesterday. He wrote on Telegram: "I thank the US President for the invitation. We all hope for a quick and sure end to this war. Russia must stop the war it started. I hope our combined strength with the US and our European friends will help Russia make a real peace."</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan City Forms Low-Carbon Transport Alliance to Become a Leading City</h1>
            <p>To encourage low-carbon transport, Taoyuan City today started the Low-Carbon Transport Alliance. This alliance will work with both government and private companies to slowly improve rules, make technology better, promote eco-friendly ways to travel, and offer help for buying low-carbon vehicles. The goal is to make Taoyuan City a leading low-carbon city in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Today, Taoyuan City's Environmental Protection Department held a press conference for the "Low-Carbon Transport Alliance" at the Guishan Diesel Vehicle Emissions Testing Station. Many electric car makers and transport companies came together to show electric vehicles and charging equipment. This showed how well transport is changing to low-carbon options.</p>
            <p>Taoyuan City's Deputy Mayor, Su Chun-pin, told reporters that Taoyuan has an international airport and is close to Taipei Port, making it a main center for logistics in Taiwan. Because of this, making transport low-carbon is very important for Taoyuan. The city government brought together the Environmental Protection Department, the Department of Transportation, and the Economic Development Department. They invited government bodies, electric car companies, and transport businesses to help create the alliance. This alliance will work together to improve rules, make technology better, support eco-friendly transport, and offer help to buy low-carbon vehicles. This will create a full plan for low-carbon transport in Taoyuan.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsin-chieh, a manager at Taoyuan Bus, said that Taoyuan Bus has already replaced 85 diesel buses with electric ones this year. Next year, they plan to buy 90 more. They hope that by next year, 35% of their buses will be electric. From a driver's point of view, electric buses are easier to drive than old diesel buses. They also have many more safety features, both active and passive.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department said that the city government plans to help replace 100 large trucks and 229 small trucks by 2030. They expect this will reduce carbon emissions by 38,000 tons each year. This "Low-Carbon Transport Alliance" has also connected electric vehicle makers and transport companies to offer special deals. This helps companies feel less pressure when buying new vehicles and speeds up the change. In the future, they will keep looking at what industries need and use many different plans to make Taoyuan's transport more low-carbon, making it a leading low-carbon city in the country.</p>

            <h1>Wu Shu-jen Faints at Home in Tainan, Hospitalized for Several Days, Now Stable and Back Home</h1>
            <p>Wu Shu-jen, the wife of former President Chen Shui-bian, fainted at her home in Tainan on August 15th and was taken to the hospital. For a short time, she stopped breathing and her heart stopped. After emergency help, she got better. She was taken to Tainan Sin Lau Hospital for treatment and stayed there for observation. She became stable and went home this morning to rest.</p>
            <p>Sin Lau Hospital confirmed that Wu Shu-jen was discharged this morning after her family finished the paperwork, and she has gone home to rest.</p>
            <p>Wu Shu-jen suddenly fainted at her home on the afternoon of August 15th for an unknown reason. It seemed she stopped breathing and her heart stopped. The Tainan City Fire Bureau was called, and staff on the phone told the caller how to give emergency help. At the same time, emergency workers and vehicles were sent to the house. When the rescue workers arrived, they continued the emergency help. She was taken to Tainan Sin Lau Hospital by ambulance. On the way to the hospital, her breathing and heartbeat returned. When she arrived at the hospital, the medical team took over her care.</p>
            <p>Chen Chih-chung, Chen Shui-bian's son, wrote on Facebook on August 16th that orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up) is a serious problem for people with spinal cord injuries and can be very dangerous. He said that in the 40 years since Wu Shu-jen was injured, he does not know how many times she has almost died. After being saved, her heart and breathing came back, but when she arrived at the hospital, her Glasgow Coma Scale score was only 3 (which means she was deeply unconscious).</p>
