            <h1>Central Election Commission: "Urgent" words are okay for recalls, but no hidden polls</h1>
            <p>The first group of recall elections in Taiwan will have their votes on July 26. Starting today, July 16, until the voting ends, people are not allowed to share or talk about election polls or any information that looks like a poll.</p>
            <p>Some people asked if using words like "urgent" or "rescue" for the recall campaign would break the rules about polls. The Central Election Commission (CEC) said today in a press release that people on both sides of the recall campaign can use words like "urgent" or "rescue." The election office respects this.</p>
            <p>However, the CEC said that during the time when polls are banned, people cannot share or talk about poll results, or secretly include poll information when using words like "urgent" or "rescue." If someone reports a case, the 23 election offices across the country will investigate it according to the law.</p>
            <p>The CEC gave an example: if someone discusses or shares poll information on social media groups, or if the media reports it during the ban period, they might break the law. The CEC reminds people that for 10 days before the vote, no one can share, report, or talk about any poll information related to this recall election.</p>
            <p>The law also says that on voting day, there cannot be any campaigning or recall promotion activities.</p>

            <h1>United States Starts Investigation on Brazil's Trade Practices, Could Lead to 50% Tariffs</h1>
            <p>On July 15, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said that the United States has started an investigation into Brazil's trade practices. He called these practices "unfair." This news comes one week after US President Trump said he would put a 50% tax (tariff) on goods imported from Brazil. Starting this investigation makes it legal to do so.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that since President Trump began his second term in January, he has started a trade war. He has added taxes on goods from almost all countries the US trades with. His goal is to change the world's economy and stop what he calls unfair treatment of the US for many years.</p>
            <p>Mr. Greer said that President Trump asked for this investigation by the US Trade Representative (USTR). It will decide if Brazil's rules for digital trade and special taxes are "unreasonable or unfair," and if they "harm or limit American businesses."</p>
            <p>In a statement, he also said, "Following President Trump's orders, I am starting a Section 301 investigation against Brazil's attacks."</p>
            <p>He said that American social media companies, workers, farmers, and technology innovators are being hurt by Brazil's "unfair trade practices."</p>
            <p>After many discussions, Mr. Greer added, "I believe Brazil's taxes and other trade barriers need a full investigation. We may also need to take action in return."</p>
            <p>President Trump explained why he will put a 50% tax on Brazilian goods starting August 1. This tax rate is much higher than the 10% first suggested. He also demanded an end to the trial of former President Bolsonaro, who is accused of planning a coup.</p>
            <p>The high taxes the US plans to put on Brazil surprised many trade experts. This is because Brazil buys more goods from the US than it sells, and because Trump clearly connected the tax rate to Bolsonaro's trial.</p>
            <p>Brazil has not yet said anything about the US starting this investigation. Brazil's Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said yesterday that Washington has not replied to Brazil's trade offers made two months ago.</p>
            <p>During his first term, President Trump used Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act to explain why he put many taxes on goods from China. Section 301 was also used to investigate other countries that put digital service taxes on US tech companies.</p>
            <p>The US Trade Representative's office said in a statement that Brazil gives lower taxes to goods from other trading partners, which puts US companies at a disadvantage. It also said Brazil has not done enough to stop illegal logging. This, they said, hurts US wood producers' ability to compete.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan and US Talk About Tariffs: Trade Office Wants Lower Taxes Than Japan and South Korea</h1>
            <p>Taiwan and the United States are still talking about taxes on goods (tariffs). Some lawmakers in Taiwan's KMT party are worried that Taiwan is giving up too much in these talks. Yen Hui-hsin, the Deputy Chief Negotiator for Taiwan's Office of Trade Negotiations, said today that Taiwan wants to get a tariff rate that is at least not higher than what its competitors, like Japan and South Korea, have.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump recently signed an order that delays new "equal tariffs" until August 1. For Japan and South Korea, which are major trading partners with the US, the new tariff rate is 25%. As of July 16, the US has not yet announced the equal tariff rate for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee invited people from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Security Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, and the Office of Trade Negotiations. They were asked to report on the progress of the Taiwan-US equal tariff talks, what they expect to achieve, how it might affect Taiwan, and how Taiwan plans to respond.</p>
            <p>KMT lawmakers Hsu Chiao-hsin and Ma Wen-chun both asked if Taiwan was giving too much in the tariff talks with the US. They questioned if the talks were fair and asked for the "bottom line" of the negotiations.</p>
            <p>Yen Hui-hsin answered that the main goal of the equal tariff talks is to get the lowest possible tariff. She said that Taiwan wants to get a tariff rate that is at least not higher than that of its competitors, like Japan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>Chen Ming-chi, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that calling the talks "unfair" is too strong. He explained that Taiwan is talking with the US based on principles of mutual benefit. Taiwan's goals are to protect its national interests, its industries, public health, and food safety. The aim is to get the lowest possible tariff rate.</p>
            <p>Regarding questions about labeling US pork and beef, and zero tariffs, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Tu Wen-chen explained that Taiwan is the eighth largest buyer of US farm products. Also, the US is Taiwan's largest buyer of farm products. She said that trade in agriculture between the two sides is very close, and the Ministry of Agriculture fully supports Taiwan's agriculture.</p>
