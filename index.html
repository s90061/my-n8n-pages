            <h1>ADATA's August Sales Near 5 Billion, Up Over 60% Year-on-Year, Setting New Record for the Period</h1>
            <p>ADATA, a company that makes memory modules, announced its August sales. The company's sales reached nearly 4.983 billion New Taiwan dollars. This is 16.93% more than the previous month and 64.53% more than the same month last year. This is the highest August sales the company has ever had.</p>
            <p>ADATA said that memory prices went up, which was the main reason for the high sales in August. For the first eight months of the year, the company's total sales were 31.928 billion New Taiwan dollars. This is 18.29% more than the same period last year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Li-pai, the chairman of ADATA, said in a press release that the company is positive about orders for DDR4 and DDR5 DRAM in the third quarter. DRAM is a type of computer memory.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen also said that companies supplying NAND Flash are still controlling how much they produce. NAND Flash is another type of memory for storing data. There is strong demand from data centers. Also, new electronic products are coming out, which means more need for storage. So, the NAND Flash market is expected to stay strong and grow in the third quarter. ADATA expects its business to be very active in the third quarter.</p>

            <h1>Matsu Art Island Gets Support from Residents and Shops; Artworks Now in Hotel Lobbies</h1>
            <p>You can also see artworks in hotel lobbies and restaurants. The 3rd Matsu International Art Festival has a special plan to work with local shops. This plan allows artworks to stay in these places permanently. Chen Chao-bao, a photographer from Matsu, also joined the plan. He used his camera to record stories of old people in the area.</p>
            <p>One of the plans for the 3rd Matsu International Art Festival is called "Guests Sit Together: Lights, Don't Let Them Out." The organizer, Hsin Chi, told the media that this plan will have three art pieces. All of them are based on the historical memory of "blackouts" during the time of military rule. These artworks will be shown in restaurants and hotels. The goal is to let visitors feel the local life of Matsu residents through places they visit often.</p>
            <p>For example, one of the artworks is "Dark Roof Tiles" by artist Hsu Ching-ting. It is placed at the entrance of "Longfu Villa," the first legal hotel in Matsu. The wooden lamp stand looks like a traditional Fujian-style wooden building. It also includes "ya-wa-shi," special stones used on roofs in Matsu, as decoration. A big blackout curtain with Min-Dong words written on it goes with it. This reminds people of Matsu's history during military times, when every house had to cover its lights with cloth.</p>
            <p>Wang Yuan-sung, the general manager of Longfu Villa, said he noticed that more local residents are taking part compared to the past two festivals. He immediately signed up when he heard about the Matsu Art Festival working with shops for the first time. The Longfu Villa building itself is not very similar to traditional Matsu buildings. The "Dark Roof Tiles" artwork is planned to replace the hotel's old crystal chandelier in the future. He hopes this lamp, which shows Matsu's culture, will make the hotel feel more connected to the local area.</p>
            <p>Besides the plan to work with shops, some artworks from the Matsu Art Festival will stay on display even after the festival ends. For example, "Fishing Tide" is an artwork created by artist Liu Chih-hung with Matsu residents and students. It is a piece that shows how to weave traditional fishing nets, learned from Matsu fishermen. In the future, this artwork will be a permanent display at "Wujianpai," a historical building in Qiaozai Village, Beigan, Matsu.</p>
            <p>Chen Chao-bao, who was born in Beigan, Matsu, is also one of the organizers of this Matsu Art Festival. Besides planning artworks, he is also showing his photography work called "Ordinary Homes." This work features old local people. He went into their homes and showed their living spaces. Some living rooms have "wind lanterns," a special item in Matsu. Some older people still follow old traditions, like believing that keeping a coffin in the corner of the house helps them live longer.</p>
            <p>Chen Chao-bao said that people in Matsu used to live by traditional fishing for a long time. Their living conditions only got much better after martial law ended. People who lived through traditional fishing and military rule had a harder life. So, his main idea was to show and honor these older people. He hopes to thank them for their hard years.</p>
            <p>The 3rd Matsu International Art Festival started now and will continue until November 16.</p>
