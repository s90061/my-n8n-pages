            <h1>US and France Improve Joint Military Satellite Work to Fight China's Space Power</h1>
            <p>A senior general from the United States told Reuters that France and the US are planning their second joint mission. They will work together to move satellites in space. This is part of how the two countries are helping their allies collect intelligence. They want to do this because China is increasing its military presence in space.</p>
            <p>This action will be the third known time the Pentagon has worked with allies in space. Late last year, the US and France first worked together to move two satellites in orbit. Also, the US Space Command did a joint mission with the United Kingdom earlier this month.</p>
            <p>Space has become a place where military competition is growing. More and more satellites are important for communication, warning about missiles, and getting information from battlefields. These satellites are now facing threats from the world's main space powers. China, Russia, and the United States have all shown anti-satellite weapons. They have also sent spacecraft that can move around. This makes people worry that if there are attacks during a conflict, they could stop GPS navigation or cut off communication channels that soldiers on the ground use.</p>
            <p>Controlling spacecraft more carefully and working with international allies has become a key part of what officials call the new global space race. The US and its allies are competing strongly with China and Russia.</p>
            <p>US Space Force Lieutenant General Douglas Schiess spoke to Reuters and said, "We are now planning an operation with France." General Schiess leads a group that works with the US Space Command on secret military space activities. He did not share more details.</p>
            <p>France spends the most money on space in Europe. He said that there might be more operations with other countries in the future. He added, "I think we can do more."</p>
            <p>Recently, military space officials from Western countries, including Europe, the US, and Canada, have warned that threats to many satellites are growing. These threats are to military assets and also to commercial satellite groups like SpaceX's Starlink, which hundreds of millions of people around the world use.</p>
            <p>The French Space Command did not want to comment on any plans. About the first operation, the French Space Command said they trained with the US to make their cooperation stronger. They also wanted to learn how to work together and "show that we are strategically united."</p>
            <p>The French Space Command stressed that they "must be ready for military space operations in real situations."</p>
            <p>When Reuters asked about the first operation in Paris recently, French Space Command General Vincent Chusseau did not give details. But he stressed, "We think this operation was very successful."</p>
            <p>US Space Command General Stephen Whiting said in April that the first joint operation was called "rendezvous and close-proximity operations." During this, military satellites from the US and France moved close to a "strategic competitor's" satellite. General Schiess was asked last week but did not say which country the third nearby satellite belonged to.</p>
            <p>The UK said that in the second operation, which happened from September 4 to 12 last year, a satellite controlled by the US Space Command moved. It moved to check if the UK's military communication satellite SKYNET 5A was working as expected in space. According to the UK government, both satellites were in a special orbit called geostationary orbit. This is about 36,000 kilometers from Earth, and they move at about 3 kilometers per second.</p>
            <p>Even though the UK and US did not say which US satellite was part of the operation, Comspoc, a company that provides software to understand space situations, saw something. They saw a US spy satellite called USA 271, which can move very well, come close to the UK's SKYNET 5A between September 5 and 11.</p>
            <p>UK Space Command General Paul Tedman announced this operation last week. He said it was the first time his forces had taken part in such a mission. He added that it "shows a big improvement in our ability to operate." He also said, "We can now do advanced operations in space with our allies. This is to protect and defend our shared national and military interests in space."</p>

            <h1>Legislative Yuan Committee Convenor Elections: DPP Wins 8, KMT 7, TPP 1 Seats</h1>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan held elections for the convenors of its 8 regular committees. All 8 committees chose their convenors by nominating them. The Kuomintang (KMT) party let the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) legislator Liu Shu-bin become the convenor for the Education and Culture Committee. The results of the election were: the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won 8 convenor seats, the KMT won 7 seats, and the TPP won 1 seat.</p>
            <p>The fourth session of the 11th Legislative Yuan started a few days ago. Today, the elections for the convenors of the 8 regular committees were held. By rules, each regular committee has 2 convenors. These convenors are very important because they decide what the committee will discuss. Since the Legislative Yuan will look at the budget again in this new session, the convenor seats in each regular committee are very important for all the political parties.</p>
            <p>For the Internal Administration Committee, DPP legislator Wang Mei-hui and KMT legislator Huang Chien-pin were chosen as convenors.</p>
            <p>For the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee, DPP legislator Chuang Ruei-hsiung and KMT legislator Weng Hsiao-ling were chosen as convenors.</p>

            <p>For the Education and Culture Committee, DPP legislator Chen Hsiu-pao and TPP legislator Liu Shu-bin were chosen as convenors.</p>
            <p>For the Transportation Committee, DPP legislator Lee Kun-tse and KMT legislator Hung Meng-kai were chosen as convenors.</p>
