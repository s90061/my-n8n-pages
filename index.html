The head of LinkedIn, a popular professional networking site, believes that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will not take away most jobs. Instead, he says AI will change what people do at work. This means that many jobs will be different in the future, and workers will need new skills to keep up.

Some jobs will be affected more than others. For example, jobs that involve writing, coding, or customer service might change a lot because AI can help with these tasks. However, the LinkedIn chief suggests that very few jobs will completely disappear. He emphasizes that people will need to learn new skills to work alongside AI. Many companies are already looking for employees who understand how to use AI tools. This trend highlights the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new technologies in the modern workplace.

**City Life After Work: The Impact of Hybrid Working**

New reports suggest that many city centers are becoming very quiet in the evenings, especially after 6 PM. This change is largely due to the rise of hybrid working, where employees split their time between working from home and coming into the office. Before the pandemic, city centers were often busy with people going out for dinner, drinks, or shopping after work.

Now, with fewer people in offices every day, there are fewer customers for restaurants, bars, and shops in the evening. This means businesses in city centers are struggling. Some areas that used to be lively and full of people are now described as feeling "dead" once the workday is over. This trend is pushing city planners and businesses to think of new ways to attract people back to city centers, perhaps by creating more cultural events or making them attractive places to live, not just to work.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day Visitors to Manage Tourism**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started charging a fee for day-trippers. This new rule, which began in April 2024, requires visitors who don't stay overnight to pay 5 euros (about $5.40) to enter the city. The main goal of this new fee is to help manage the huge number of tourists who visit Venice each year.

Venice is a small city built on water, and it often feels overwhelmed by too many visitors, especially during peak seasons. The city hopes that this fee will encourage some people to visit at less crowded times or to stay longer. It's an attempt to find a balance between welcoming tourists and protecting the city's delicate environment and unique culture for residents. However, there is ongoing discussion about whether the fee will truly reduce numbers or just add a small cost for visitors.`;
