            <h1>MLB Wild Card Series: Dodgers Win with Strong Hitting, Reds Eliminated First</h1>
            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, who won last year, played the Cincinnati Reds today in the second game of the MLB Wild Card Series. The Dodgers did not start well. But in the end, their strong hitting made the Reds lose. The score was 8 to 4. The Dodgers will now play against the Philadelphia Phillies in the Division Series.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers had won the first game. But today, they did not start well. Their starting pitcher, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, hit a batter in the first inning. Teoscar Hernandez, who helped them win yesterday, also made a mistake. As a result, Sal Stewart, a young player for the Reds, hit a single to right field and scored 2 runs first.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers' offense started to put pressure on the Reds in the 3rd inning. Ben Rortvedt hit a double to get into scoring position. Then Mookie Betts hit a single to score 1 run for the team. In the bottom of the 4th inning, Max Muncy got a hit. Enrique Hernandez then hit a double to right field to tie the game. Miguel Rojas then hit a single to take the lead again. At this time, the Reds took out their starting pitcher, Zack Littell. The Reds were behind 2 to 3.</p>
            <p>In the 6th inning, the Reds tried to come back. TJ Friedl, their lead-off hitter, led the attack. They had several hits in a row, which made the bases loaded with no outs. But Yoshinobu Yamamoto then used his curveball well. He struck out two batters in a row to stop the Reds from scoring. From then on, the Dodgers gained control of the game.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 6th inning, Enrique HernÃ¡ndez of the Dodgers hit a single first. Shohei Ohtani then hit a single to score a run for the Dodgers. After that, the whole Dodgers' batting lineup hit the Reds' relief pitchers hard. Betts and Teoscar Hernandez both hit doubles. The Dodgers scored 4 runs in this inning. The score was now 7 to 2.</p>
            <p>In the last part of the game, the Dodgers' relief pitchers gave up runs again in the 8th inning. They also allowed the bases to become loaded. Luckily, Alex Vesia finally got the last out. In the 9th inning, the Dodgers sent out Roki Sasaki to finish the game. He made the opponents get three outs without scoring, including two strikeouts, while the crowd cheered loudly.</p>
            <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched for 6.2 innings today, did not allow any earned runs, and got the win. He gave up 4 hits and struck out 9 batters, throwing 113 pitches. Ohtani had 1 hit in 4 at-bats and 1 RBI today. After losing, the Reds were the first team to be out of the playoffs. The Dodgers will now play against the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series.</p>

            <h1>Cho Jung-tai: Hualien Disaster Area Will Recover Step by Step, Causes Will Be Fully Checked to Make Disaster Prevention Better</h1>
            <p>More than one week has passed since a lake formed by a landslide, called a "barrier lake," caused a disaster in Mataian, Hualien. Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that rescue and recovery work is continuing now. After that, they will fully check why the disaster happened and how the response was. This will help them fix problems and find out who is responsible.</p>
            <p>The Mataian barrier lake in Hualien caused a disaster over a week ago. As of yesterday, 18 people have died, 6 are still missing, and 139 are injured. Lee Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said today at a press conference after a meeting that Premier Cho Jung-tai explained the rescue and recovery work is happening in different steps. These steps include saving lives, helping people rebuild their homes, clearing trash and mud, and making local transport and the environment normal again. The goal is for residents to have their basic lives back before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
            <p>For the next steps, Cho Jung-tai said the government will do full rebuilding work for homes, farms, businesses, and public buildings. At the same time, they will completely check the causes of this disaster and how the response was managed. This will help them improve what is lacking, understand who is responsible, and make their ability to warn and prevent future disasters from extreme weather better.</p>
            <p>Regarding those who died or were injured because of the barrier lake, Premier Cho Jung-tai led officials in the meeting today to observe one minute of silence. He also expressed deep sympathy to the families of those who died. Six people are still missing. Cho Jung-tai told rescue workers to continue searching and to use every good chance to find them. He hopes for a good outcome and sends prayers for the missing.</p>
            <p>He also thanked all levels of government, the military, and volunteers for helping residents fix their homes since the event happened. He said this shows great strength and unity. The government will also fully support the work after the disaster. Minister Ji Lian-cheng of the Executive Yuan has already visited the families of the victims to offer comfort. Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim will also go to the disaster area again to show the government's concern and respect.</p>

            <h1>More Cases of Drivers Not Stopping for Pedestrians; Taipei Motor Vehicles Office Says Drivers Need to Follow Rules Better</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Motor Vehicles Office said today that the number of cases where drivers in Taipei did not stop for pedestrians increased in the first half of this year compared to the same time last year. This shows that some drivers need to follow traffic laws better. The Ministry of Transportation has increased the fines for not stopping for pedestrians and asks drivers to be careful.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Taipei City Department of Transportation held a press conference titled "Not stopping for pedestrians means high costs with doubled fines." According to information from the Taipei City Traffic Adjudication Office, to warn drivers about stopping for pedestrians, the Ministry of Transportation increased the fines for not yielding to pedestrians that cause injury or death. Since June 30, the fine for minor injuries has increased to NT$18,000. If someone is seriously injured or dies, the highest fine can be NT$36,000.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Motor Vehicles Office reported that in the first half of this year, there were 11,818 cases where drivers did not stop for pedestrians in Taipei. This is an increase of 1,969 cases, or 19.99%, compared to the same period last year. This shows that some drivers still need to improve how they follow the rules about stopping for pedestrians.</p>
            <p>The office also pointed out that if a vehicle does not stop for a pedestrian and causes an accident with injuries or deaths, there will be not only high fines but also civil and criminal responsibilities. Drivers must follow road safety rules. They should also be more careful, always look at what is around them, and make sure they can see well. This is how they can best prevent traffic accidents.</p>
            <p>Li Tian-xing, the head of the adjudication section, said in an interview that he advises road users to be very careful when driving through intersections without traffic lights or pedestrian crossings. If not, accidents with injuries or deaths could happen. Also, because pedestrians are often more vulnerable, vehicles should always yield to pedestrians, no matter what the traffic lights show.</p>
            <p>He also said that drivers should be very careful when driving through a pedestrian crossing. If a pedestrian crosses without following the traffic light, their responsibility might be smaller. But if an accident happens, there will be not only a fine but also civil and criminal responsibilities, long legal processes, and large compensation costs. He asks everyone to pay attention to traffic safety.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Motor Vehicles Office stated that drivers often have wrong ideas, for example, thinking that if the A-pillar blocks their view, it was not on purpose. But the correct idea is that if a pedestrian crosses on a crosswalk with the light, they do not have to take responsibility for the accident. Drivers should also be aware of the blind spot caused by the A-pillar and turn their head to check. Whether there is a traffic light or not, vehicles should stop for pedestrians when approaching a crosswalk.</p>
