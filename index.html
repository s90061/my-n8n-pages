**Egypt Signs Debt Agreements with Germany, Italy, and China**

Egypt has recently signed agreements with Germany and Italy to swap debt. They are also getting ready to sign a similar agreement with China for the first time. These agreements will help Egypt pay less foreign debt and promote green energy projects in the country. This can also help them get more aid from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

According to Al Ahram newspaper, Egypt's Minister of Economic Development and Planning, Rania Al-Mashat, announced on July 3rd that Egypt has signed debt swap agreements with Germany and Italy. These agreements are worth more than 900 million US dollars (about 26 billion New Taiwan Dollars). She also said that Egypt is preparing a debt swap agreement with China.

The minister spoke at a UN meeting in Spain. She said that the meeting was about achieving goals for sustainable development and changing how international money works. A main topic was the increasing debt of developing countries. She explained that in 2023, the foreign debt for low and middle-income countries reached a new high of 8.8 trillion US dollars. The cost to pay back this debt was 1.4 trillion US dollars, which is twice as much as 10 years ago. Over 60% of low-income countries are in debt trouble or close to it.

Debt swap agreements are a way for countries to cooperate financially. For example, Germany and Italy will forgive some of Egypt's debt or lower the interest rates. In return, Egypt will use the money it would have used to pay debt for projects related to climate change, renewable energy, and protecting the environment. This helps the debtor country with money problems and helps the creditor country with its diplomatic and environmental goals. There are two main types: "Debt-for-Nature" for protecting nature like coral reefs, and "Debt-for-Development" for investing in things like education, healthcare, or green energy projects.

**Teenager Drowns While Swimming at JinYue Waterfall in Yilan**

Eleven teenagers from Taipei and New Taipei went to JinYue Waterfall in Nan'ao Township, Yilan County, to swim yesterday. Sadly, one of them, a teenager named He, drowned. It is believed he was not a good swimmer. Police are still investigating what caused the accident.

Police and firefighters were called to the waterfall yesterday afternoon after the drowning. They pulled Mr. He out of the water, but he showed no signs of life. He was taken to the hospital but did not survive.

It is understood that the group of 11 teenagers included 9 boys and 2 girls. Ten of them had just finished vocational high school, and one was still a student. They rode their scooters to the waterfall to swim, hoping to enjoy the start of their summer vacation. Their friends who were with them are very sad about what happened.

Local people said that JinYue Waterfall sometimes has strong currents or hidden dangers in the water. They advise that people should go with professionals and wear life jackets to stay safe.
