            <p>The police found that two men had a physical fight because of money problems. The butcher, Mr. Lin, owed money. He seemed upset that the other person kept asking for the money back. So, tonight, he used a kitchen knife from his meat stall to cut the man on his back and arm, causing 7 cuts.</p>
            <p>Many people saw what happened and were very scared, so they ran away. The police said that luckily, the man who was cut was taken to Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. He is awake and not in danger.</p>
