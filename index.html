            <h1>Japanese Traveler's Luggage Seemed Lost, Metro Police Find It Was a False Alarm</h1>
            <p>A Japanese man recently put his bag in a locker at Nangang Exhibition Center Station in Taipei Metro. He thought the locker was locked, but it wasn't. Later, he found his bag was gone. The metro police looked into it and found out it was just a misunderstanding.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Police Department's Metro Police Team shared this news today. Police officers Zhang Wen-Yi and Ye Jun-Chang were on duty when they heard about the missing bag and helped the traveler.</p>
            <p>They learned that the Japanese traveler was visiting Taiwan. He put his bag in locker number 9 at Nangang Exhibition Center Station. But when he came back to get his bag later, he couldn't open the locker.</p>
            <p>The metro police checked security cameras. They saw that the Japanese traveler didn't know how to use the locker well. After putting his bag in and paying, he thought the door would lock automatically, so he left. But the locker did not actually lock. Later, another traveler wanted to use the same locker. That person saw the bag inside, took it out, and put it on the floor.</p>
            <p>After that, a worker who checks the lockers saw the bag on the floor. The worker moved it to another empty locker.</p>
            <p>The Japanese traveler did not know any of this. When he came back to get his bag, he was surprised that the locker wouldn't open. Luckily, after the metro police checked many places and asked around, they found it was just a false alarm. They found his bag in another locker. They checked the contents, and everything was there. They gave the bag back to the Japanese traveler.</p>
            <p>The Japanese traveler was very happy and praised the metro police for quickly helping him find his lost item. He then continued his trip in Taiwan happily.</p>

            <h1>Care Disputes Happen Often, Nursing Home Groups Ask for Easier Rules for Managers</h1>
            <p>Right now, only nurses can be in charge of nursing homes. But there are many legal problems about patient care. Many nurses who are put in charge are not the owners. They have to deal with all the legal risks by themselves. Now, groups that represent nursing homes want the rules to change. They want any adult citizen to be able to be the person in charge.</p>
            <p>Zhou Shi-Ling, the past head of the Taiwan Nursing Home Association, told reporters today that many nurses in charge of nursing homes are not the people who invested money. Yet, they alone face legal problems. In recent years, there have been many care disputes in nursing homes in places like Taoyuan, Nantou, and New Taipei. Most of the nurses in charge were found not guilty in the end. But the long legal process caused a lot of stress. Some even left their jobs, which hurt the quality of care in these places.</p>
            <p>Zhou Shi-Ling said that changing the law would not stop nurses from starting their own businesses. It would just stop hired nurses from having to deal with legal risks that are not their fault. Last year, they talked with government groups about changing the law, and they agreed on some main ideas. Three political parties and 17 lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan supported the new draft law. But before it went to the Legislative Yuan, the Taiwan Union of Nurses Association and the Ministry of Health and Welfare disagreed. If the government keeps ignoring this, the nursing home groups might protest.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare's Nursing and Health Care Division replied that the Taiwan Nursing Home Association wants to change the "Nursing Personnel Act." They want to let any adult citizen be the person in charge of a nursing home, instead of only nurses. They held a meeting on August 8 last year to talk about this. They asked the association to make a new proposal and to agree with nursing groups on the changes. But the association wrote a letter on September 11 of the same year saying they would not follow the meeting's decision. This means they went against what was agreed in the meeting.</p>
            <p>The Care Division said that investors and nursing home managers often have legal problems about hiring, inheritance, and contracts. They suggest making guidelines for contracts, similar to private medical clinics, to help solve these issues. To help with worries about legal risks, the Ministry of Health and Welfare will work with nursing groups. They want to help nurses improve their skills in running nursing homes and teach them more about laws and business.</p>
            <p>Nursing homes mostly take care of patients who need nursing skills. They are set up under the Nursing Personnel Act and are special medical places for nursing professionals. Because they deal with the quality of professional care and people's rights, their laws and rules are the same as other medical places in the country. The person in charge of such a place must be a professional in that field.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Union of Nurses Association released a statement today. They said they understand the problems with the nursing home system. But nurses, like doctors and other medical staff, can legally be in charge of institutions. This is important to protect their professional status and fairness. If the law changes too quickly, it might make it unclear who is responsible.</p>
            <p>The Nurses Association suggests that the government quickly create rules for how nursing organizations are managed, including nursing foundations and associations. These rules should clearly separate the responsibilities of the owners and the professional managers. Also, they should bring in fair competition rules to stop monopolies and unfair competition. They also reminded nurses not to lend their licenses or let their names be used for positions easily, so they do not become scapegoats.</p>

            <h1>Extra Budget Adds NT$120 Million for BaiPaoHu Social Housing; National Land Management Agency: It's About Fairness in Housing</h1>
            <p>The Executive Yuan recently suggested adding more money to the budget because some funds were cut. News reports said that the Ministry of the Interior has fully put back NT$120 million for the BaiPaoHu social housing project in Xizhi District, New Taipei City. This money was completely removed from the budget before. The National Land Management Agency said this is a legal move to ensure fair housing and to help young people in New Taipei.</p>
            <p>On August 14, the Executive Yuan approved a plan to add more money to the central government's budget for 2025. A total of NT$87.84 billion will be added. This extra money will come from the leftover funds from this year's original budget.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-Tai said that over NT$200 billion was cut from the central government's spending this year. Also, the Executive Yuan had to cut an extra NT$63.6 billion. This was a very large amount. At first, they had to lower the money given to local governments. But considering the work local governments need to do, and that central government departments still needed money even after saving, they decided to add more to the budget. The Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee is expected to review this on August 28.</p>
            <p>News reports said that the Legislative Yuan's budget office found that the Executive Yuan's plan to add to the budget included putting back over NT$13.2 billion that was cut. The Ministry of the Interior had the highest amount put back, at 95.4%. For example, the NT$124 million for the "BaiPaoHu Sports, Leisure, and Ecological Park and Social Housing Project" was completely cut before. Now, 100% of this money is being put back into the budget.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of the Interior's National Land Management Agency said in a press release today that putting the money back into the original project budget is legal. It is to make sure housing is fair and to help young people in the New Taipei area. It will also provide a sports center with many activities for young families and students.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency pointed out that Xizhi District in New Taipei City is a difficult area to find land for social housing. The original plan involved different government departments working together to develop the area. This plan was expected to provide thousands of social housing units, long-term care facilities, social welfare facilities, a 3.4-hectare sports center, and outdoor sports facilities. These would meet the needs for living and leisure for people of all ages. Also, the New Taipei City Government has been actively helping with building roads and public pipes around the area.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency said that because the original budget was cut so much, the whole project stopped for a while. This also affected many public construction projects and the rights of people in Xizhi District.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency stated that the money added back in the 2025 extra budget will help the New Taipei City Government plan and design the BaiPaoHu Ecological Park and pay for land purchases. It will also allow the National Housing and Urban Regeneration Center to plan social housing in a way that builds a whole community. They ask all political parties in the Legislative Yuan to support the future development of Xizhi.</p>
