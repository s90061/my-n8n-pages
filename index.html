            <h1>UN Warns: Gaza Crisis Could Be Like Past Famines in Africa</h1>
            <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said today that the bad situation in Gaza reminds them of famines in Ethiopia and Biafra during the 1900s.</p>
            <p>Ross Smith, who is in charge of emergencies for WFP, told reporters in Geneva, "We have not seen a situation like this in this century."</p>
            <p>He spoke from Rome by video and said, "This reminds us of the terrible events that happened in Ethiopia and Biafra in the last century."</p>
            <p>"We need to act quickly now."</p>
            <p>He said this after a group called the "Integrated Food Security Phase Classification" (IPC) warned today. This group sets global rules for how bad a food crisis is. They said, "The worst famine is happening in the Gaza Strip."</p>
            <p>United Nations groups use the IPC to check how many people do not have enough food. The IPC team said that only "immediate and open" help going into Gaza can stop "hunger and deaths" from quickly increasing.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith said, "The disaster is happening in front of our eyes, on our TV screens."</p>
            <p>"This is not just a warning; it is a call for us to do something."</p>
            <p>After talks for a ceasefire failed, Israel completely blocked Gaza on March 2nd. Only by late May, after warnings about hunger, did Israel start to let a small amount of help enter again.</p>
            <p>The IPC team said that the newest numbers show "most areas of the Gaza Strip" have reached a level where there is a "famine."</p>

            <h1>Japan Says New Deal with US Gives It Best Tax Rates on Chips and Medicines</h1>
            <p>Today, Akazawa Ryosei, a Japanese official who talks with the United States about taxes on goods, said that a trade agreement made last week will let Japan pay the lowest taxes on computer chips and medicines sent to the US.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Mr. Akazawa told reporters, "If another country gets a lower tax rate from the US for chips and medicines, then Japan will also get that lower tax rate."</p>
            <p>A research group in Washington called the Hudson Institute said that Mr. Akazawa and his team got a special rule. This rule protects Japan from new taxes that the US might put on medicines and chips. These taxes are under a rule called "Section 232."</p>
            <p>"Section 232" is a part of a law from 1962. It lets the US President put limits on goods coming into the country if it is for national safety reasons.</p>
            <p>This special rule is like a "most-favored-nation" rule. It makes sure that Japan will get the same lowest taxes on goods, even if other countries make better deals with the US.</p>
            <p>Last week, Japan and the US finished their trade agreement. The US will lower taxes on Japanese cars and other goods sent to the US to 15%. Japan will also invest 550 billion US dollars in the US. This includes buying shares, giving loans, and making promises to pay debts.</p>

            <h1>President Lai Visits Disaster Center, Talks to Mayors About Bad Weather</h1>
            <p>Today, President Lai Ching-te went to the main center for managing disasters in Taiwan. He spoke by video with the mayors of Tainan, Chiayi, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung. He wanted to know about the bad weather and damage in their areas. He told the people working at the center to keep working hard and help people stay safe.</p>
            <p>A bad weather system is bringing a lot of rain. The weather office is still warning about heavy rain. They think the rain will move from the coast to areas further inside the land tonight. There could be very heavy rain in the south.</p>
            <p>The President's office said in a statement tonight that President Lai visited the disaster center this afternoon. He said the government's job is to help people with problems and quickly help them rebuild their homes. He said the central government and local governments should work together to build water projects. This is to get ready for how the weather will change in the future and affect different parts of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The President said that from the reports and video calls, it was clear that different government departments and local governments worked well together. Because of this, they handled the problems from the rain quickly and well. However, the rain from the weather system is expected to continue for a few more days. He asked everyone to keep working hard to make sure the rain causes as little trouble as possible for people.</p>
            <p>The President said that Premier Cho Jung-tai had already visited Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan this morning to see the damage. To help these areas rebuild faster, Mr. Cho will ask Chen Jin-de, a government minister, to start a special team in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan. An advisor, Lee Meng-yen, will also help. This team will include people from the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Public Construction Commission. Their first meeting will be in Tainan tomorrow morning. He asked all groups involved to work hard on rebuilding.</p>
            <p>The President said that the government's goal is to solve problems for people. He asked everyone to use their ideas and energy. For example, the central government and local governments can work together to ask companies that build things for the government to help with rebuilding first. He wants them to really think about the people who are affected and help them rebuild their homes quickly. This will stop more serious problems if there is another storm or heavy rain. The central government will also help with money.</p>
            <p>The President said that Taiwan often has natural disasters. Over many years, Taiwan has learned how to deal with them and has overcome many challenges. But the weather is changing quickly. He asked the government and local governments to continue building water projects. This is to get ready for how climate change will affect different parts of Taiwan in the future. He hopes everyone will work together to make people feel safe.</p>
            <p>The Water Resources Agency said in a press statement that during today's video meeting, the four mayors talked about floods, people moving away because of possible landslides, damage to farms, and help from the army. They especially praised the Water Resources Agency's work in controlling floods.</p>
