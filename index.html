            <h1>Left-handed Power Hitter Lin Jun-yi Crushes World No. 6, Enters Quarterfinals at China Masters Badminton Tournament</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's "left-handed power hitter" Lin Jun-yi won today in the BWF Super 750 China Masters Badminton Tournament. In the Round of 16, he beat Jonatan Christie from Indonesia, who is ranked 6th in the world. The scores were 21-5 and 22-20. Lin Jun-yi has now reached the quarterfinals.</p>
            <p>Lin Jun-yi is ranked 15th in the world. Before today's match, he had played Christie three times and lost all of them. Today, he won against Christie for the first time.</p>
            <p>In the first round (Round of 32), Lin Jun-yi played against Lee Zii Jia from Malaysia. However, Lee Zii Jia stopped playing in the third game because of an injury. This allowed Lin Jun-yi to move to the Round of 16.</p>
            <p>Today, Lin Jun-yi played against Christie again. Christie is 28 years old and won a gold medal at the Asian Games in 2018. In the first game, Lin Jun-yi played almost perfectly. After being behind 1-2, he scored 12 points in a row. He took the lead and made it very hard for his opponent to fight back.</p>
            <p>In the second game, both players fought hard. The score was tied 15 times. But towards the end of the game, Lin Jun-yi played more steadily. He also moved the shuttlecock well between the front and back of the court. When the score was 19-20, he saved a game point. Then, he scored two more points and won the game in an exciting comeback.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwan's men's doubles team, Wang Chi-lin and Chiu Hsiang-chieh, played against the Indian team Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty in the Round of 16 today. The Taiwanese team lost in just 33 minutes with scores of 13-21 and 12-21. This is the ninth time this season they have stopped in the Round of 16.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Mita Forms, September Remains a Peak Month with an Average of 5.04 Typhoons, Second Highest of the Year</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Mita formed this afternoon. The Central Weather Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said that the middle and end of September are still busy times for typhoons. Statistics show that September has the second highest number of typhoons in a year, with an average of 5.04. This is only less than August, which has an average of 5.39 typhoons.</p>
            <p>Tropical Depression No. 20 has become a light typhoon, Mita. The Weather Administration also said that Tropical Depressions No. 21 and 22 might also become typhoons today.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration posted on its Facebook page, "Report on Weather - Central Weather Administration," that long-term data (from 1958 to 2024) shows about 25 to 27 typhoons form each year in the Northwest Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. Most of them, 70% of the total, happen from July to October.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration stated that the number of typhoons slowly starts to increase in spring as the weather gets warmer. From April to May, about 1 typhoon forms each month. In June, almost 2 typhoons form.</p>
            <p>Moving into summer and autumn, the Weather Administration pointed out that July to October is the busiest time for typhoons. August has the most, with an average of 5.39 typhoons. September is next with 5.04 typhoons. July and October also have about 4 typhoons on average.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration mentioned that many people think typhoons will happen less often after summer vacation. But actually, September and October are still very active months for typhoons.</p>
            <p>As the cooler air from the north moves south, typhoon activity slowly decreases. The Weather Administration said that sometimes typhoons still appear at the end of the year. There have even been "New Year's Eve typhoons" that cross into the new year. Statistics show that in November, there are about 2 typhoons, and in December, about 1 typhoon forms.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration stated that January to March is a quiet season for typhoons. However, sometimes typhoons still form in these months, but the number is much lower, with about 1 typhoon across these three months on average.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration reminded everyone that these statistics are long-term averages and do not mean every year will be the same. The number of typhoons changes each year. Historically, the year with the most typhoons was 1964, with 37. The year with the fewest was 2010, with only 14.</p>
