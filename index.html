            <h1>Israel Air Attack, Yemeni Rebels Confirm Their Government's Prime Minister Died</h1>
            <p>The Houthi rebels in Yemen said today that recent Israeli air attacks on Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, killed some high-level officials in the Houthi-controlled government. This includes Prime Minister Rahawi and several ministers.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Houthi movement stated in an announcement that Rahawi and several ministers died in the air attack on Sanaa on August 28.</p>
            <p>The Israeli military said on August 28 that their forces "accurately attacked military targets of the Houthi terrorist government in the Sanaa area of Yemen."</p>
            <p>Rahawi had been the Prime Minister of the Houthi-led government since August 2024.</p>
            <p>During the war between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian armed group in the Gaza Strip, the Houthi movement fired missiles at Israel many times. The Houthi movement said these attacks were to show support for the Palestinian people.</p>

            <h1>Japan to Deploy Long-Range Missiles in Kyushu, Reaching China's Coast and Taiwan Waters</h1>
            <p>To respond to China's growing activities in the ocean, Japan is quickly making its southwestern islands stronger for defense. Japan has decided that starting this year, it will put improved long-range "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles" at the Kengun base in Kumamoto City, Kyushu. These missiles can reach China's coast and the waters around Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Japan's Ministry of Defense decided to deploy the improved long-range "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles" at the Ground Self-Defense Force's Kengun base in Kumamoto City starting this year. This is to make the defense of the southwestern islands stronger.</p>
            <p>Also, in the next few years, Japan is thinking about deploying these missiles at the Yufuin base in Yufu City, Oita Prefecture, and the Katsuren sub-base in Uruma City, Okinawa Prefecture.</p>
            <p>Currently, the Ground Self-Defense Force's surface-to-ship ballistic missiles can only reach a few hundred kilometers. The new improved surface-to-ship ballistic missiles will have a range of over 1000 kilometers. If these are put in Kyushu, they can cover the waters around Taiwan and coastal areas of China.</p>
            <p>The report said that a source from the Ministry of Defense stated, "This will greatly increase our ability to deter (enemies)."</p>
            <p>Some people say that China might be ready to attack Taiwan as early as 2027. Japan's Ministry of Defense is worried about a "Taiwan emergency." So, they decided to start deploying the improved "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles" this year, earlier than the original plan of 2026 or later. They are also thinking about deploying them in all seven surface-to-ship missile units across the country in the future.</p>
            <p>Regarding the deployment of the improved "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles" at the Kengun base in Kumamoto City, Kazumi Ito, the head of the Kyushu Defense Bureau of the Ministry of Defense, visited Kumamoto Prefecture Governor Takashi Kimura yesterday and explained the plan.</p>
            <p>Kimura said, "National defense is a matter for the national government. The deployment is a decision made after many years of discussion." Kimura said he understands, but also pointed out that some local residents are worried. He asked the Ministry of Defense to explain to the residents and to take safety measures, such as holding training.</p>
            <p>Okinawa Prefecture Governor Denny Tamaki is against the deployment. In March this year, Tamaki met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi in Okinawa Prefecture. Tamaki said, "If these (improved Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles) are deployed, the risk of being attacked will increase, and the people of Okinawa Prefecture will not understand."</p>

            <h1>US Senate Armed Services Committee Delegation Visits Taiwan; Lin Chia-lung: Taiwan-US Friendship is Strong, Protecting Democracy Together</h1>
            <p>Today, the visit of the US Senate Armed Services Committee delegation, led by Chairman Roger Wicker, ended in Taiwan. Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said that the visit showed a strong message: the friendship between Taiwan and the US is very strong. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to work closely with the US Congress and the government to protect democracy and make things better together.</p>
            <p>US Senator Roger Wicker, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taiwan on August 29 and left by plane at 3:40 PM today. This was Wicker's first time leading a delegation to Taiwan as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was also the first visit by a US Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman in nine years.</p>
            <p>Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung wrote on Facebook in the evening that Wicker's visit was very important. It sent a strong message that the friendship between Taiwan and the US is very strong. Since the US Congress passed the "Taiwan Relations Act" in 1979 and former US President Ronald Reagan made the "Six Assurances" in 1982, these two promises have always been key parts of Taiwan-US relations. They continue to support Taiwan in making its defense stronger.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung also said that the peace in the Taiwan Strait and the safety and wealth of the Indo-Pacific region are currently facing threats and problems from authoritarian powers. Only by showing a strong will to defend itself and working with countries that think similarly can Taiwan keep peace through strength.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung stated that under President Lai's leadership, Taiwan is slowly increasing its defense budget. In 2026, it will reach 3.32% of its GDP, and the goal is to reach 5% of GDP by 2030. At the same time, Taiwan also hopes to work more closely with the US to make its asymmetric warfare capabilities even stronger.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung pointed out that Wicker's delegation also visited Palau, a country friendly with Taiwan, and the Philippines, with whom Taiwan is working more and more closely. Taiwan also hopes to use the recent opportunities for cooperation with the US in technology and energy to build a partnership that benefits both sides. Taiwan also wants to expand this cooperation to other countries in the "first island chain" and beyond, like a "Taiwan-US joint fleet," to help friendly countries benefit from each other.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung repeated that Taiwan and the US are not only strategic partners but also a community of democracies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to work directly with the US Congress and government to make Taiwan-US relations deeper, protect democracy, and make things better together, making regional peace stronger.</p>
