            <h1>Soldier in Taichung Charged for Being a Fraudster to Earn More Money</h1>
            <p>A 22-year-old man named Wu, who was a soldier, wanted to earn extra money. He had a stable army job with a monthly salary of NT$50,000. But he became a money collector for a fraud group. After he was caught, he was put in jail. Now, he has been charged with serious fraud and other crimes. Mr. Wu might be removed from the army because of this, which would be a big loss for him.</p>
            <p>The Dadu Police Station in Taichung released a statement today. They recently received a report about a fake investment scam. The victim, Mr. Chang, 40, tried many times to get his money back but couldn't. He then realized he was cheated and told the police. The police said that Mr. Chang joined an investment group called "Wealth Plan" on LINE through Facebook. The customer service person told him he could "always make money" if he bought gold for profit. Mr. Chang saw that the fake website showed high profits, so he sent or gave them money several times, totaling NT$1.8 million. When Mr. Chang wanted to get his NT$28.78 million profit, the fraud group asked him to pay a "10% charity donation." Only then did he realize he was scammed.</p>
            <p>The police worked with Mr. Chang to catch Mr. Wu, who came to collect the money. The investigation showed that Mr. Wu was a soldier with a steady NT$50,000 monthly salary and a good future in the army. However, he wanted to earn extra money and looked for "unusual jobs" online. Then, he followed the fraud group's orders to sign fake contracts and collect money from different victims.</p>
            <p>The day Mr. Wu was caught, the Taichung District Court ordered him to be kept in jail. The Taichung District Prosecutor's Office charged him with breaking laws about organized crime, serious fraud, and money laundering. They also asked for his sentence to be increased by half based on laws about preventing fraud. The court is now reviewing his case. Mr. Wu might be removed from the army, which means he will lose much more than he gained.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan City Wants People to Pay for Removing Illegal Buildings</h1>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Government has approved a draft law called "Taoyuan City Regulations for Charging Fees for Compulsory Demolition of Illegal Buildings." This draft will be sent to the City Council for their decision. If it passes, the city government can charge the owner of the illegal building or other responsible people for the costs when they have to remove an illegal building. This will help create a fairer system.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Department of Building Management released a news statement this morning. They said that according to the "Building Act," there is a rule that says "the owner of a building must pay for the costs of compulsory demolition." The city government proposed a similar draft law in 2019, but it was not approved because there were still questions about its completeness. This new change to the law has used practical experience, current national laws, and ideas from Taipei City and New Taipei City to improve and strengthen the rules.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chuang Ching-chuan, the head of the Department of Building Management, said that the city government currently pays for the compulsory removal of illegal buildings. This costs public money and does not stop people from building illegally. The new draft law clearly states how fees will be calculated, the process for collecting them, and how people's rights will be protected. This makes the demolition process official and legal. In the future, the cost will depend on the type of building materials used. It will be between NT$200 and NT$1,700 per square meter. They hope this will stop people who try to break the rules.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chuang said that if the law is passed, the Taoyuan City government will first remove large illegal buildings that are still being built and illegal buildings that are dangerous to public safety. They will then collect the demolition fees as stated in the law. This helps the city keep its rule that land use must follow land control rules and that public safety comes first.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Coach Suspended for One Game in U12 World Cup Due to Pitcher Rule Violation</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Tainan, August 3) Taiwan's U12 World Cup baseball team won against South Korea in extra innings yesterday. However, the last pitcher, Huang Yu-chien, did not follow the rule about resting between games. Because of this, Taiwan's head coach, Chang Tzu-chien, was suspended for one game. He could not coach the team in today's third-place game against South Korea.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's U12 World Cup team played against South Korea in their last Super Round game yesterday. Both teams played a tough game that went into the 9th inning with the tie-breaker rule. Taiwan's team scored many runs and won the game 11-5. They played South Korea again today for the third-place game.</p>
            <p>Pitcher Huang Yu-chien, who played in the 9th inning yesterday, had pitched 53 balls on July 31st. The rules say that if a pitcher throws 46 to 60 balls, they must rest for 2 days before playing again. But Huang Yu-chien played too soon yesterday and did not follow the rule. Because of this, the Taiwan team was fined, and head coach Chang Tzu-chien was suspended for one game.</p>
