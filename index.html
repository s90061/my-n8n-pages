            <h1>TPBL Dreamers Lose First Game Badly, Coach Jian Hao Gives Himself 0 Points</h1>
            <p>The TPBL Dreamers played their first game of the new season today against the New Taipei Kings. The Dreamers made 29 mistakes during the whole game. Most of their points came from foreign player Holman, who scored 32 points. In the end, they lost badly to the Kings with a score of 93 to 112. The Dreamers' head coach, Jian Hao, said his first game as a coach was a "0" score.</p>
            <p>This season, the New Taipei Kings do not have their main player, Jeremy Lin. But in their first two games, their defense has been surprisingly strong. In their first game, they made Kaohsiung Aquas make 19 mistakes. Today, they forced the Formosa Dreamers to make 29 mistakes.</p>
            <p>The Kings continued their good play from yesterday. They led 37 to 21 in the first quarter. By halftime, they were still ahead 62 to 50. In the third quarter, the Kings attacked strongly and made the score difference more than 20 points. This made it impossible for the Dreamers to catch up.</p>
            <p>Jian Hao stopped playing basketball after last season and became a head coach. After the game, he said he was very unhappy with the match. He said making 29 mistakes means you cannot win. When they kept making mistakes, the other team quickly scored, and their team's spirit dropped fast.</p>
            <p>He also said that the Kings played with five small players in their first two games, which is different from when Jeremy Lin played for them. However, he felt that his team's strategies were not carried out well. He was not happy with how hard his players tried on the court.</p>
            <p>Jian Hao usually smiles a lot. But for his first game as a coach, he said seriously, "0 points. When you lose, it's 0 points."</p>

            <h1>CPBL Playoff Challenge: Lin Tzu-Wei, the MVP, Helps Monkeys Win Second Game, Says It's Best to Relax When Facing a Must-Win Game</h1>
            <p>Rakuten Monkeys player Lin Tzu-Wei kept his good playing form in the playoff challenge. Today, he hit two times and got three RBIs (runs batted in), helping his team beat Uni-President Lions 9 to 3. This win was very important and was their second victory. Lin Tzu-Wei won the MVP award. He said that when facing a game you must win, it's "better to relax more." He also said that baseball is a team game, not about one person.</p>
            <p>Before today's game in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) playoff challenge, the Monkeys had won 1 game and lost 2, so they had to win. Today, they played against the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions. In the 3rd inning, Lin Tzu-Wei hit a key ball that brought two runs home. In the 4th inning, he hit another ball that scored a run. In the 6th inning, he walked to first base. In total, he had two hits and three RBIs, which helped his team win and tie the series.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Lin Tzu-Wei batted 6th and got three hits and one RBI. Today, he batted 3rd to keep his good play going. After the game, he said that he tries his best in every game, no matter where he bats in the lineup.</p>
            <p>Lin Tzu-Wei has played well in these two games. He thanks his faith, which helps him feel calm and safe on the field. Even though there is pressure not to lose, he remembered what Lin Hung-Yu, the team's leader, told everyone: "The more relaxed you are, the better." He said it's important to think clearly about your plan when you hit, no matter what happens.</p>
            <p>About his important hit in the 3rd inning with all bases loaded, Lin Tzu-Wei said that in that situation, you must hit the ball if it goes through the strike zone. He added that the Lions' starting pitcher, Yohander MÃ©ndez, is hard to hit. He knew he had to try to hit the ball before getting two strikes. He said that the good result came from everyone on the team. If other players had not gotten on base before him, there would not have been a chance to score with all bases loaded.</p>
            <p>Lin Tzu-Wei said that for two days in a row, they had games they could not lose. But the mood in the locker room was still relaxed. Lin Hung-Yu gathered everyone and told them that they should not have any other thoughts and just try their best. Lin Tzu-Wei also spoke to the fans, thanking them for supporting the team. He said, "We hope you will continue to support us and cheer for us."</p>

            <h1>Chinese Chip Company Wingtech Loses Control of Its Dutch Subsidiary for One Year</h1>
            <p>Wingtech Technology, a Chinese company that makes computer chips, announced today that its Dutch company, Nexperia, has received an order from the Dutch government and a court decision. This order says that Nexperia and its 30 companies, branches, and offices around the world cannot change anything about their money, ideas, work, or staff for one year. This means Wingtech has lost control over Nexperia for now.</p>
            <p>The Chinese government and other groups have not yet said anything about this. But it has made the Chinese technology industry worried. They think it shows that Western countries are trying to stop China from growing in technology.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology stated in its announcement that the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy issued a "Ministerial Order" to Nexperia on September 30th. This order made the demands mentioned above and will last for one year.</p>
            <p>The announcement also says that the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal then decided that Wingtech Technology would temporarily lose its power over Nexperia. This power was held by its company, Yuchen Holdings. Wingtech will keep only one share, but it will lose its rights as a shareholder for the other 99 shares, like the right to manage and vote. This made Wingtech lose control of Nexperia for a short time. Reports also say that Zhang Xuecheng, Nexperia's CEO, has had his job and power stopped because of this.</p>
            <p>However, the announcement clearly states that Wingtech will still get money from Nexperia as a shareholder. This part is not affected.</p>
            <p>The announcement also said that Nexperia's daily business is still working. But because of the government order and court decision, it will have to deal with temporary changes or delays in making decisions. It will also be harder to use its resources freely. These things might affect how well the company works in the short term.</p>
            <p>According to Chinese financial news, Nexperia is where Wingtech Technology handles its chip business. It has almost 16,000 different chip products. It is important in making chips for cars and other special chips. Nexperia also has "strong working relationships" with big companies around the world that make new energy cars, power grid energy, communication products, and data products.</p>
            <p>The parent company, Wingtech Technology, is a Chinese company that designs, develops, and makes computer chips. Its products are used in many types of electronic designs all over the world.</p>
            <p>The report also said that some people in the Chinese industry think that the Netherlands made this decision because they are worried about chip technology leaving their country. This is especially true because Nexperia is a key company in making chips for cars, and its technology is important for major infrastructure. In 2022, the UK also asked Wingtech Technology to give up its ownership in a technology company it bought, saying it was for national security reasons.</p>
