            <h1>US Envoy: Putin Agrees to Let US Give Security Guarantees to Ukraine</h1>
            <p>Steve Witkoff, a special representative for US President Trump, told CNN today that Russian President Putin agreed to let the United States provide "strong security guarantees" to Ukraine. This would be part of a possible peace deal.</p>
            <p>Witkoff spoke on CNN's "State of the Union" show. He told the host, Jake Tapper, "We agreed on strong security guarantees. I would call this a big change."</p>
            <p>Witkoff also said these security guarantees are like Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This means they would protect Ukraine if Russia attacks again.</p>
            <p>He added that Putin also agreed to make a law saying Russia will not go into any land in Ukraine or other parts of Europe. This is also part of a possible peace deal.</p>

            <h1>British Actor Terence Stamp, Known as General Zod in Superman Movies, Dies</h1>
            <p>Terence Stamp, a famous British actor, passed away today at the age of 87. Many people knew him for playing the villain "General Zod" in the popular Hollywood movies "Superman" and "Superman II."</p>
            <p>Terence Stamp's family sent a statement to Reuters. They said that Terence Stamp died this morning. The statement said, "He (Terence Stamp) leaves behind many wonderful works. As an actor and a writer, he will keep touching and inspiring people for many years."</p>
            <p>Reports say that Terence Stamp was born in East End, London, in 1938. He lived through the bombings of London during World War II. After school, he first worked in advertising. Later, he won a scholarship to study acting in drama school.</p>
            <p>He was nominated for an Oscar. He acted in movies like "Theorem" in 1968, "A Season in Hell" in 1971, and "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" in 1994.</p>
            <p>Also, Terence Stamp tried to become James Bond after Sean Connery, but he did not get the part.</p>
            <p>Terence Stamp played the main bad guy, "General Zod," in the 1978 movie "Superman" and the 1980 movie "Superman II." Christopher Reeve was the star in these movies.</p>

            <h1>Many European Leaders Join Zelenskyy on US Visit; BBC Calls It "Never Seen Before"</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is going to Washington to talk with US President Trump. Leaders from Europe and NATO will go with him. The BBC says this is a very special moment, something "never seen before." It seems European leaders are a bit worried after the US-Russia meeting.</p>
            <p>The US wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly. Because of this strong pressure, Zelenskyy will fly to Washington tomorrow. He wants to protect Ukraine's interests and try to avoid any more problems with Trump at the White House.</p>
            <p>Today, several leaders said they would go with Zelenskyy. These include German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
            <p>This visit was first planned as just a meeting between two people. Now, it has become much bigger, even though Trump and Zelenskyy might still have a private talk.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that this gathering is very unusual. It is hard to imagine so many European leaders flying across the Atlantic quickly to talk about just one topic.</p>
            <p>European leaders seem worried after President Trump met with Russian President Putin in Alaska.</p>
            <p>One of their main goals is to get security promises for Ukraine after a peace deal with Russia. European leaders also want to talk to Trump about Ukraine's land and make it clear they will continue to support Ukraine.</p>
            <p>In February, Trump and US Vice President JD Vance openly scolded Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. This moment shocked people around the world.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy was basically made to leave the White House then. It was hard to believe their relationship could get better. But in the months after, European leaders worked quietly to fix things. Leaders who were good friends with Trump tried to help Zelenskyy get Trump's approval.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy learned how to give compliments to Trump and how to talk like a business person.</p>
            <p>In April, Ukraine and the US signed an agreement about minerals. Trump and Zelenskyy also had a private talk at the Vatican. Ukraine clearly said they were ready to buy American weapons.</p>
            <p>In July, Trump and Zelenskyy talked on the phone. Zelenskyy said it was "our best conversation."</p>
            <p>People still think Trump can be easily influenced by praise and likes strong leaders. So, Ukraine is still concerned about how much influence Putin has over him.</p>
            <p>But Zelenskyy continues to learn. Before the meeting in the Oval Office on the 18th, he has European friends to help him. Merz said about this, "We will give some good advice."</p>
            <p>The BBC pointed out that Starmer will play a big part in helping Zelenskyy talk with Trump.</p>
            <p>Starmer has tried hard to keep a good relationship with Trump. Their meetings were friendly, like when Starmer visited the White House in February and when Trump recently visited Scotland. Starmer and Stubb might be the European leaders who are closest to Trump.</p>
            <p>The UK Prime Minister's office strongly believes that Starmer being at this event can help a lot. He can act as a go-between for Trump and Zelenskyy.</p>
