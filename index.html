            <h1>Wang Hong-wei Again Questions Document About Failed Recall; Presidential Office Says It's Wrong Information</h1>
            <p>Wang Hong-wei, a member of the Kuomintang party in the government, said yesterday that the Presidential Office sent a letter to the Executive Yuan. She claimed the letter asked to check why the "726 recall" election failed. The Presidential Office shared the official document and said Wang Hong-wei was wrong. They said she changed a "monthly report of public concerns from July" into a false story, claiming it was "the government's first time saying the recall failed." Today, Wang Hong-wei said again that the Presidential Office is just trying to change the subject. The Presidential Office said it was wrong for certain politicians to use a small part of the information to mislead people and cause arguments in society.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Wang Hong-wei showed a document from the Presidential Office. She said it was a letter from the Presidential Office to the Executive Yuan, asking them to check why the "726 recall" failed. She called it "the first time the government officially said the big recall failed." The spokesperson for the Presidential Office, Kuo Ya-hui, showed the official document. She said Wang Hong-wei was changing the meaning of documents and lying. Kuo Ya-hui explained that the document was a "monthly report of what people are talking about," put together by the Public Affairs Office of the Presidential Office. She said all the information in it showed what people were worried about, and it was not, as Wang Hong-wei said, "work asked for by the Presidential Office and Executive Yuan."</p>
            <p>However, today, Wang Hong-wei told news groups that the document the Presidential Office showed was exactly the same as the one she showed. This means, she said, that the Presidential Office confirmed her document was real and correct.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-wei explained that the Presidential Office just wants to change the subject. She said the Presidential Office did indeed ask the Executive Yuan to check why the "726 recall" election failed. This, she said, means that President Lai Ching-te admits the big recall was a big failure. It also proves that President Lai started this big recall.</p>
            <p>Kuo Ya-hui replied this afternoon. She said it was sad that politicians turned the "monthly report of public concerns from July" into a false story, claiming it was "the government's first time saying the recall failed." She asked politicians to speak based on facts and avoid lying, so they don't lose in court again.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi-chuan, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party in the government, also wrote on social media. He said the Presidential Office gets concerns and suggestions from people every day. Every month, they regularly collect these for government departments to use for improving their work. He said this has been happening for a long time, but Wang Hong-wei purposefully changed only a part of the information to attack politically. He added that this is another time she has been found to be lying by a court.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi-chuan pointed out that Wang Hong-wei only showed the first item of the document, and purposely hid the other seven items. He asked why she didn't show the full document. He said if she showed the other seven items, it would be very clear that it was just a summary of public opinion from July, which would prove her political attack was on purpose and mean. He said that "people giving their opinions on the recall" was twisted into "the Presidential Office admits the recall failed." He wondered if she did this to show her unhappiness from being almost recalled six months ago.</p>

            <h1>Typhoons Often Damage Power; Government Will Check Burying Cables Underground and Make Some Areas Stronger Against Wind</h1>
            <p>Typhoons often cause power outages. Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that the government will start to check if power cables can be buried underground across Taiwan. An official from the Executive Yuan added that if an area is suitable, the cables will be buried underground step by step over several years. In areas that are not suitable, like the coast of Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan, where the ground might sink, they will instead make the power system stronger against wind. For example, they will change the distance between power poles and make them stronger.</p>
            <p>When typhoons hit, they often cause problems with sending electricity. Premier Cho Jung-tai visited Taitung today to see the damage from Typhoon Willow. He said that Typhoon Danas caused over one million homes to lose power, heavy rain on July 28 also caused more than 50,000 homes to lose power, and Typhoon Willow caused over 300,000 homes to lose power. He said the government needs to solve the problem of power outages caused by typhoons. On Lanyu island, because the power cables are already underground, there was much less work to do after the recent disaster. So, he will ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) to start checking and planning for burying all power cables underground in Taiwan. If areas are suitable, they will do it year by year.</p>
            <p>An official from the Executive Yuan told reporters that checking all of Taiwan for burying power cables will take some time. So, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower will start right away, as Premier Cho has asked.</p>
            <p>The official also said that the coastal areas of Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan were badly hit. These areas have problems like the ground sinking, which makes it hard to bury cables underground. So, for now, they are focusing on fixing the broken power equipment. They are also making areas that face the wind or get a lot of wind stronger. This means things like changing where power towers are placed, changing the distance between power poles and making them stronger, being better prepared for disasters, and changing overhead power lines. This will make the whole power system better.</p>
            <p>For places in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan with good roads, the official said that Taipower Chairman Tseng Wen-sheng has pointed out that the main power lines are often on provincial highways. In the western coastal areas, these are roads like Taiwan Provincial Highway 17 and 19. These places usually have good road bases, so they can be thought of as places to bury cables underground first.</p>
            <p>The official said that a special law for fixing and rebuilding after Typhoon Danas and the heavy rain on July 28 has recently passed. This law includes a plan to spend 10 billion New Taiwan Dollars to make the power system in disaster areas stronger. The money for this will come from a special budget set aside by this special law.</p>
            <p>Also, the Executive Yuan recently approved a draft law to change the special law for making the economy, society, and people's lives stronger against world events and national safety. The total money set aside for this has been increased to 590 billion New Taiwan Dollars. An extra 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars will be used to make power stronger in industrial areas across Taiwan. This draft law will be sent to the law-making body for them to check.</p>
            <p>The official said that the 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars for industrial areas is to make sure the power supply is steady. Of course, they will think about moving power lines to make them stronger. They will also check if all cables can be buried underground at the same time. The goal is to make sure the power supply is steady.</p>
            <p>In 2023, Typhoon Koinu caused a lot of damage to Lanyu island's power system. After that, the Executive Yuan approved a special project to bury all power cables underground on Lanyu island. This project will cost about 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars. The total length of the cables to be buried is about 23.7 kilometers, and the work will be finished in two years.</p>

            <h1>Shanghai Lingang's First Self-Driving Taxis Officially Start Work and Are Taking Customers</h1>
            <p>The first group of self-driving taxis, also called Robotaxis, in Shanghai's Lingang New Area have officially started working. They are now taking customers in areas that include schools, office buildings, and shopping centers. This news comes after self-driving taxis also started working in Pudong New Area (in Jinqiao and Huamu) at the beginning of August.</p>
            <p>The first self-driving taxis in Shanghai Lingang New Area officially started taking customers on August 15. The news says that these taxis now cover 58 places in the main part of Lingang city, including schools, office buildings, and important shopping areas. They work every day from 8 AM to 8 PM.</p>
            <p>To call a self-driving taxi, you follow the same steps as calling a regular taxi online. You order through a mobile app on your phone. After you order, a self-driving taxi will accept your request, and your phone screen will show the car's license plate number and its route. Once you get into the taxi, you need to touch "Start Now" on the screen behind the front passenger's seat. Only then will the car begin to move.</p>
            <p>Ma Liyin, an officer from the Data Department of the Shanghai Lingang New Area Management Committee, told the news that Lingang will make its "industry-scenario-system" way of working better. He said they will use the benefit of trying new rules first. This will help them make sure that driverless smart cars are used safely. They plan to slowly make more self-driving taxis available and use them more for business.</p>
            <p>The "2025 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) and Artificial Intelligence Global Governance High-level Meeting" took place on July 26. At this meeting, there was a special discussion called the "AI-Powered Autonomous Driving Innovation and Development Forum." During this forum, the first "Smart Connected Vehicle Demonstration Operation Licenses" were given out in Shanghai. These licenses are like special permits that allow companies to offer self-driving taxi services in certain areas.</p>
            <p>Eight companies received these licenses. They include Pony.ai (Shanghai), Baidu Apollo (Shanghai), SAIC AI Lab (Shanghai), Dazhong Transportation, SAIC Mobility Services Co., Ltd., Shanghai Qiangsheng Taxi Co., Ltd., Shanghai Jinjiang Taxi, and Shanghai Youdao Zhitu.</p>
