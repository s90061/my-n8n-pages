            <h1>Japanese Star Kenshin Kamimura Found Guilty of Indecent Assault on Hong Kong Female Translator, Fined Nearly NT$60,000</h1>
            <p>Kenshin Kamimura, a 26-year-old former member of a Japanese idol group, was found guilty today by a judge in Hong Kong. He was accused of touching a female translator's leg at a celebration party in March, after an event in Hong Kong. He has to pay a fine of 15,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is about 57,200 New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Kenshin Kamimura was a member of the boy group ONE N'ONLY. He became very popular because of his role in the BL drama "Minors." His career was doing very well. However, in early March, after he went to Hong Kong with another actor from the drama, Junsei Motoshima, for their first overseas fan meeting, news spread that he was arrested in a restaurant for touching a female translator.</p>
            <p>His management company later announced that they ended their contract with Kamimura and he left the group. They said he "seriously broke his contract." His Instagram account was also deleted, and all his future events were cancelled. This surprised his fans very much.</p>
            <p>Before the court started today, many fans waited for several hours in line to enter and listen to the case.</p>
            <p>According to reports from news agencies like AFP, Ming Pao, and Hong Kong 01, Kamimura was accused of touching the female translator's leg many times. He did not listen when she said no. He also asked her to go to the restroom with him.</p>
            <p>The judge, Yu Chun-heung, decided that Kamimura had a bad intention. The judge also said that his actions clearly showed disrespect for women.</p>
            <p>After Kamimura learned that he only had to pay a fine and would not go to jail, he hugged his male court interpreter. Some fans cried when they found out Kamimura was found guilty.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Yangliu Weakens to a Tropical Storm, Taiwan Island Leaves Warning Area</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Yangliu is moving away. The weather agency said that Yangliu has become weaker. At 11 PM tonight, it became a tropical storm. The main island of Taiwan is now out of the typhoon's warning area. The land warning now only covers Penghu and Kinmen. Kinmen especially should still be careful of strong winds and rain until early tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Administration, at 11 PM tonight, Typhoon Yangliu's center was at 23.7 degrees North latitude and 118.0 degrees East longitude. This is about 90 kilometers southwest of Kinmen. It is moving northwest at a speed of 30 to 33 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>The weather agency pointed out that Yangliu has gotten weaker in the past 3 hours. Its center is now close to the southwest coast of Kinmen. It will continue to move northwest. The main island of Taiwan is no longer in its warning area. However, it still poses a threat to Penghu and Kinmen, where winds and rain continue. The typhoon is expected to keep getting weaker, and its warning area is also expected to become smaller.</p>
            <p>Forecaster Chu Mei-lin said in a press conference that Yangliu is moving quickly to the northwest. It is expected to make landfall in China late tonight. Its strength will also slowly decrease. Taiwan's main island is now out of the warning area. The land warning is only for Penghu and Kinmen. Kinmen, especially, should be careful of wind and rain from tonight until early tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin said that the wind in eastern Taiwan is blowing from the south-southeast. So, Hualien and Taitung will still have heavy rain until tomorrow morning. The strong rain clouds on the east and south sides of Yangliu are growing, so the southwest coast and Penghu will still have rain on and off.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin also said that after tomorrow morning, the rain will become less, and the weather will get better. Most places will be cloudy to sunny. Western Taiwan should be careful of afternoon thunderstorms, especially in the central mountains, where there will be heavier rain. Eastern Taiwan will have showers on and off.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin mentioned that the weather will be mostly stable until August 17th. Starting from the evening of August 16th, there will be more rain due to moisture from the south. On August 19th and 20th, the weather will return to being cloudy to sunny.</p>
            <p>According to the weather agency's observations, from 12 AM on August 12th to 11 PM on August 13th, the heaviest rainfall was in Dahan Mountain in Pingtung County with 453.5 millimeters, Fengnan in Hualien County with 381.5 millimeters, Chishang in Taitung County with 351.5 millimeters, and Nantianchi in Kaohsiung City with 250.5 millimeters. Areas with stronger gusts of wind included Lanyu and Green Island with level 17 or above, Dongji Island with level 13, Taitung with level 12, Chenggong and New Taipei with level 11, Xinwu, Su-ao, Pengjia Islet, Taipei, and Sun Moon Lake with level 10.</p>
