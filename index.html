Starting today, France has made its smoking rules stricter. It is now against the law to smoke on beaches and in public parks. This new rule is part of a plan to keep children safe from smoke from other people's cigarettes.

The French government announced this new law yesterday, and it became active today. The law also says that people should not smoke within 10 meters of places like schools, swimming pools, and libraries. If someone breaks this law, they could pay a fine of 135 Euros (about 4600 New Taiwan Dollars) up to 700 Euros (about 23,800 New Taiwan Dollars). However, the health ministry might give a short time for people to get used to the new rules before giving out fines.

People who fight against smoking are not fully happy because the law does not include e-cigarettes or outdoor cafes. Yves Martinet from the National Committee Against Smoking said that this new rule is a good step but not enough. Official information shows that between 3,000 and 5,000 people die each year in France because of smoke from other people's cigarettes.

The French center for tracking drugs and addiction says that fewer people are smoking in France. The number of smokers is the lowest it has been since 2000. By 2023, less than one-fourth of adults aged 18 to 75 smoked every day. Smoking causes 75,000 deaths in France each year. It also costs the country 156 billion Euros every year due to lost lives, poorer quality of life, less work done, police work, and healthcare. A recent survey showed that 62% of French people support banning smoking in public places.

**More than 1,000 Land Crabs Killed on Xiaoliuqiu Roads; Meiren Road May Be Closed at Night**

From May to October, land crabs on Xiaoliuqiu island go to the sea to lay their eggs. Local volunteers who help protect the crabs have found that more than 1,000 land crabs have been killed by cars on roads since the end of April this year. Because of this, the Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area Administration has decided to close a part of Meiren Road at night. This road is one of the places where many crabs are killed.

A group of 16 local people and environmental groups work as volunteers to protect the land crabs. They watch the crabs at night and count how many are killed on the roads. From April 27 to June 29 this year, 1,191 land crabs were killed by cars. The three roads where most crabs were killed are Sunset Boulevard, Shanzhugou, and Meirendong (Meiren Road).

Mr. Chen Rong-feng, from the Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area Administration, said that they are improving the environment based on what the volunteers found. They recently had a meeting and decided to regularly close a part of Meiren Road near Meirendong. This closure will be from May 1 to September 30 each year. The area from the Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area Administration's office and visitor center to the second ticket booth of the Meirendong Scenic Area will be only for walking.

Mr. Chen said that local environmental groups, the township office, and the Pingtung County Government's transportation and tourism office all agree with closing the road. Once the county government gives its approval, road signs will be put up. The Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area Administration will also meet with local tour guides tomorrow to explain the new rules. They hope that the tour guides will tell visitors about the rules to help protect the environment.

A land crab volunteer named Mr. Wang said he strongly supports the road closure. He works as a tour guide and has seen fewer land crabs each year when he takes tourists on night tours. He said that even though the Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area Administration has made changes to help the crabs cross roads, dozens of crabs still die on weekdays during egg-laying season, and over 100 on holidays. Mr. Wang believes that closing the road will allow the crabs to move safely. It will also give people on the island and tourists more space to walk at night. He added that Meiren Road has rich nature, including fireflies, so people will not have to worry about cars and can enjoy their visit more.

**Changhua Woman, 42, Suspected of Killing Mother; Prosecutor Approves Her Detention**

In Changhua County, a murder happened on June 21st. A 42-year-old woman, Ms. Zhou, had an argument with her 66-year-old mother. She is thought to have used a broom and a fruit knife to hurt her mother, and then she ran away. Her mother later died from her injuries. The police found Ms. Zhou and arrested her. However, Ms. Zhou's mental state is not stable, so the full details of the case are still being understood.

The Changhua District Prosecutor's Office said today that after Ms. Zhou was caught, the police questioned her. The prosecutor believes that Ms. Zhou committed murder and asked the Changhua District Court to keep her in jail, which was approved.

The police said that Ms. Zhou's sister reported to them on the evening of June 21st. She said she could not reach her mother, so she went to the house where her mother and sister lived. She found her mother lying on the ground, not breathing. Her sister, Ms. Zhou, was gone.

Mr. Yeh Kuo-pang, from the Changhua County Fire Department, told reporters that the fire department sent an ambulance to the house. But when they found Ms. Zhou's mother, she was not breathing and had no heartbeat. The Fangyuan Police Station in Changhua County started looking for Ms. Zhou. She was found in Taichung City. After being questioned by the police, she was sent to the Changhua District Prosecutor's Office for more questioning about the murder.
