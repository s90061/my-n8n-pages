            <h1>Taiwan President's Transit Through US: State Department Says It Follows Normal Practice</h1>
            <p>(Washington, July 17th, CNA Reporter Chung Yu-Chen) Recently, there were reports that the US might rethink allowing the Taiwan President to transit through the US. This was because a meeting between "Trump and Xi" was being planned. Today, a spokesperson for the US Department of State repeated that the Taiwan President's transit through the US follows past practice and long-standing policy.</p>
            <p>State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said at a regular press conference this afternoon that high-level officials from Taiwan, including the President, transiting through the US is normal practice. It completely follows their consistent policy. These transit arrangements consider the safety, comfort, ease, and respect for the visitor.</p>
            <p>United News Network recently reported, citing sources, that President Lai is expected to visit allied countries in Central and South America in August. His trip will include transits through New York and Dallas, Texas, in the US. The President will visit three countries that have diplomatic ties with Taiwan: Paraguay, Guatemala, and Belize.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office in the US said that they do not have any information to share right now. If there are definite plans later, the Office of the President will announce them at the right time. (Edited by Yang Chao-Yan) 1140718</p>
