            <h1>Suntory chairman resigns after buying health products linked to cannabis; Weekly Bunshun reveals details</h1>
            <p>Takeshi Niinami, who was the chairman and CEO of Suntory Holdings in Japan, has resigned today. Three hours before Suntory had a special press conference this afternoon, Mr. Niinami spoke to "Weekly Bunshun" and told the whole story. He said that his decision to resign was very quick. He was not happy about it, but he felt that if it helped Suntory have less trouble, "then everything is for Suntory."</p>
            <p>"Weekly Bunshun" reported that on the morning of August 22, more than ten men entered a home one by one in a fancy 29-story building in Tokyo's Minato Ward. These men were police officers from Fukuoka Prefecture. They had a search warrant to look for things in the house. The owner of this house was 66-year-old Takeshi Niinami.</p>
            <p>People close to the investigation said that on August 9, Fukuoka police found products with illegal THC, a part of cannabis. They then arrested the person in Fukuoka who had these products. During their investigation, they found that one of the delivery addresses for these products was Mr. Niinami's home. So, the police started an official search of his home because they thought he might have broken the "Narcotics Control Act."</p>
            <p>The search finished around noon that day. The police did not find any illegal drugs in his home. Also, Mr. Niinami's urine test showed no drugs. The police have taken Mr. Niinami's phone and computer for now and are looking at the information on them.</p>
            <p>After "Weekly Bunshun" learned about the search of Mr. Niinami's home, they asked Suntory on August 25 if the search was true and if he used illegal drugs. But the public relations department said they "could not answer." The day after the search, Mr. Niinami went to America for work and came back to Japan early on September 1.</p>
            <p>On September 2, Mr. Niinami spoke to "Weekly Bunshun" for about 80 minutes and explained the whole story.</p>
            <p>Mr. Niinami said that around 2022, in New York, the president of Suntory's American branch introduced him to a female massage therapist. She was about 60 years old and helped Japanese VIPs there with their health. This massage therapist really liked using CBD (cannabidiol) and kept telling him to take it. He asked her, "Is this safe?" She said, "It's absolutely fine. Even my 15-year-old daughter uses it."</p>
            <p>CBD (cannabidiol) is one of the main parts of cannabis. People think it can help reduce stress and help you sleep. In 2023, Japan changed its "Cannabis Control Act" and allowed CBD. However, the "Narcotics Control Act" was also changed. It now treats THC, another part of cannabis that caused the problem this time, as a narcotic.</p>
            <p>He said, "At first, I wanted to bring the health products to Japan myself. But I decided not to because I had to go through Dubai, which has very strict laws. Half of the products were given to her brother in Fukuoka when she came to Japan, and then sent to my house. For the other half, she said she would send them by air to Moji Port in Fukuoka, and then her brother would send them to my house. It turned out that her brother was arrested because he was thought to have broken the Narcotics Control Act."</p>
            <p>Mr. Niinami said that he was in New York on August 9 when the massage therapist called him. She told him, "Mr. Niinami, your name is also on the address. So the police might come to your house, and it might cause you trouble." He was planning to go abroad on August 23. He thought the police might come the day before, and they did. On the morning of August 22, at 7:30, the search team arrived. The search lasted about two and a half hours, and they took a six-page statement from him next to his bed.</p>
            <p>When asked if he knew the health products had THC, he said, "Of course I didn't know. Both of them (the massage therapist and her brother) also had no idea it was illegal. I really don't know why this ingredient was in it. I think maybe American-made products are not very accurate and they just add things. Also, I have never met her brother. He just followed his sister's instructions and sent the things to my house."</p>
            <p>Suntory found out about the situation on August 21. On the evening of August 22, an outside lawyer spoke to Mr. Niinami. On August 26, a special board meeting was held. Mr. Niinami, who was still in America for work, explained the situation through a video call. On August 28, all the directors and supervisors, except Mr. Niinami, discussed it. They all agreed to ask him to resign. Mr. Niinami admitted that he could not accept this decision.</p>
            <p>Mr. Niinami said that after he came back to Japan yesterday, he heard the president, Nobuhiro Torii, explain the board's decision. "He meant that as the chairman of a company that sells health products, buying something like this carelessly is a problem, and I should resign."</p>
            <p>He said that he arrived at the airport at 4:30 AM on September 1 and was immediately called to the company. From around 5 AM, he talked with the president for more than four hours. "I said I could not accept this decision. He replied, if you cannot accept it, then you will be fired. The Torii family, who started the company, controls the board. Since he said that, it was pointless for me to argue more. But I believe it was wrong to make a decision while I was away for work. I also wanted to join the board meeting and talk about it myself."</p>
            <p>Shinami Takeshi was invited by Nobutada Saji, who was then Suntory's chairman and president, in 2014. He became the first president of Suntory not from the founding family since the company started in 1899. In 2025, Nobuhiro Torii from the founding family took over as president, and Mr. Niinami became chairman in a move called "Taisei Hokan" (return of power to the emperor, used here to mean a transfer of power).</p>
            <p>During the 10 years Mr. Niinami was president, Suntory's sales doubled, and its profits increased two and a half times. He worked hard to grow the company's business overseas. This made more than half of Suntory's sales come from outside Japan, making it a truly global company.</p>
            <p>He said, "For these 10 years, I traveled a lot for the company. I flew about 500,000 miles, which is like going around the Earth 15 times. Business overseas was really hard, and it made me very tired. But I still worked very hard. The massage therapist told me to use CBD and warned me that if I didn't sleep, I might get dementia. But CBD actually did not work at all. Now I need sleeping pills to sleep."</p>
            <p>During the interview, Mr. Niinami's eyes sometimes became red, showing his deep feelings for the company.</p>
            <p>He said, "My employees, whom I personally trained, cried a lot and said that Suntory would not have grown without me. While hearing these words made me emotional, I also felt sorry. Maybe the board did not truly understand my hard work in America over the past 10 years. For these 10 years, I worked very hard. If resigning can help my favorite company have less trouble and make customers feel safe, then I think stepping down is all for Suntory."</p>

            <h1>Trump administration loses case, judge stops National Guard deployment in California for law enforcement</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles streets in June to make sure laws were followed. This made California Governor Newsom sue the government. Today, Judge Charles Breyer of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California decided that the Trump government cannot send the National Guard to California to fight crime.</p>
            <p>The news agency Reuters reported that Judge Breyer's decision will not start until September 12. The Trump government will likely appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>In June, President Trump ordered 4,000 National Guard members and 700 active-duty U.S. Marines to go to Los Angeles. This was a response to protests after many immigrants were arrested there.</p>
            <p>This action made things more tense in Los Angeles. Democrats also said that Trump used the military to stop people from speaking against his strict immigration rules. Also, this brought up new questions about what legal powers a U.S. President has.</p>
            <p>Gavin Newsom, a famous Democrat in the U.S., said that the Trump government broke a long-standing rule in America and the Posse Comitatus Act. This law strictly limits using federal troops for law enforcement inside the country.</p>
            <p>The Trump government, however, argued that the U.S. Constitution allows the President to use the military to protect federal government workers and property. They said this part is not limited by the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
            <p>But in his decision today, Judge Breyer wrote that based on the evidence shown during the trial, the Trump government used troops and military vehicles to set up blocked areas, stop traffic, and control crowds. "Simply put," he wrote, "the government broke the Posse Comitatus Act."</p>
