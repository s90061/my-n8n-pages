            <h1>Greta Thunberg Leads Humanitarian Boats to Break Gaza Blockade</h1>
            <p>The organizers said today that a group of boats with aid and activists, like the Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, has started its journey from Barcelona, Spain. They promised to try and break the illegal blockade on Gaza.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, the "Global Sumud Flotilla" organizers said about 20 boats left the eastern Spanish port city just after 3:30 PM local time. They said they want to create a safe path for help and stop the ongoing genocide against Palestinian people.</p>
            <p>On its official website, the group says it is an independent organization. It is not connected to any government or political party.</p>
            <p>The boats are flying Palestinian flags and carry hundreds of people. These include activists from many countries, such as Irish actor Liam Cunningham and Spanish actor Eduard Fernandez.</p>
            <p>There are also members of parliament and public figures from different European countries on the boats. This includes Ada Colau, who used to be the mayor of Barcelona.</p>
            <p>The boats are expected to arrive in the war-torn coastal area by mid-September.</p>
            <p>Thunberg told the media, "Today's reason for sailing is not just about our trip. It is not about the mission itself that we are starting."</p>
            <p>"It is about Palestine. It is about how people are purposely stopped from getting the most basic things they need to live. It is also about why the world stays silent."</p>

            <h1>Israel Attacks Gaza, Says Hamas Military Spokesperson Obeida is Dead</h1>
            <p>Israel said today that Abu Obeida, who speaks for the Hamas military group, died yesterday. He was killed in an Israeli military operation. He is the latest high-ranking Hamas member to be killed in this war, which has lasted almost two years.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas's military group Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, was a target in an attack. Later, Defense Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that "Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas's terror acts, was destroyed in Gaza."</p>
            <p>In the 23 months of terrible fighting in the Gaza Strip, Israel has greatly hurt Hamas's leaders. Israel says it wants to destroy this armed group and free the people taken hostage in the attack on October 7, 2023, which started the war.</p>
            <p>Eyal Zamir, the chief of staff for the Israel Defense Forces, promised to keep targeting Hamas leaders. He said that most of them are now outside the country.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army has been getting ready to attack Gaza City, the biggest city in the Gaza Strip. Recently, they have bombed this area more often. They have also told people to leave immediately.</p>
            <p>Hamas has not yet said anything about Obeida's death. The Israeli army says Obeida's real name is Hudaifa al-Kahlut.</p>
            <p>Since the war began, he has given many speeches on TV. He always wore a military uniform and covered his face with a Palestinian scarf. He also sent out voice messages, press releases, and posts on social media.</p>

            <h1>US Judge Stops Sending Children Without Parents to Guatemala</h1>
            <p>Today, a US federal judge signed an order. This order stops President Trump's government from sending 10 migrant children, who are alone, to Guatemala. Lawyers said that sending these children away goes against US law.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the judge made this decision after the National Immigration Law Center, a group for immigrant rights, sued for these children early in the morning. The children are between 10 and 17 years old.</p>
            <p>Judge Sparkle Sooknanan of the D.C. federal court ordered the government to stop these deportations for 14 days. She wanted an urgent court hearing at noon. She said it looked like the children were already being sent away.</p>
            <p>Current and past US officials told Reuters that Trump's government made a deal with Guatemala. This deal would allow children without parents to be sent back to Guatemala. The plan was to start sending them away this week. CNN first reported this plan on August 29.</p>
            <p>After Republican President Trump returned to the White House in January, he started many actions to remove immigrants.</p>
            <p>Federal law says that children who arrive at the US border without parents or a guardian are called "unaccompanied migrants." They are sent to shelters run by the government. They stay there until they can live with family members or in a foster home.</p>
