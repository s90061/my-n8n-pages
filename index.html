            <h1>Reuters: Trump suddenly changed his plan and called Putin during a meeting with European leaders</h1>
            <p>On August 18, US President Trump met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House. Reuters reported, using information from an EU diplomat, that Trump stopped his meeting with the European leaders. He did this to call Russian President Putin. The original plan was for Trump to call Putin after the meeting.</p>
            <p>Trump met with Zelenskyy first, a little after 1 PM. He told the media, "I like the idea of a ceasefire."</p>
            <p>But Trump also said, "We can work for a peace agreement even while they (Russia and Ukraine) are still fighting." He added that some recent peace agreements were made without the fighting stopping first.</p>
            <p>When asked if US soldiers would stay in Ukraine to keep the peace, Trump did not answer directly. He only said, "Maybe I will tell you the answer later today."</p>
            <p>He said that after meeting Zelenskyy and leaders from many European countries today, he would call Putin. A meeting between Trump and Putin had just happened three days before at a military base in Alaska. This made today's meeting at the White House even more important.</p>
            <p>However, Reuters reported later that afternoon that Trump stopped his meeting with Zelenskyy and leaders from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the European Commission, and NATO. He stopped the meeting to talk to Putin.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy's spokesperson later told CNN that the meeting with Trump and the European leaders started again. It was a "leaders only" meeting in the Oval Office at the White House.</p>

            <h1>Trump meets European leaders; Macron asks for a four-way summit with US, Europe, Russia, and Ukraine</h1>
            <p>On August 18, US President Trump met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and many European leaders at the White House. Trump wanted to have a three-way summit later with the US, Russia, and Ukraine. French President Macron suggested adding Europe to this meeting, making it a four-way summit. This meeting would include the US, Europe, Russia, and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Macron spoke in a public part of the meeting, before the private discussions. He said, "I think that for the next step, we might need a four-way meeting. This is because when we talk about safety, we are talking about the safety of the whole European continent."</p>
            <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz asked for a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war before the three-way summit with the US, Russia, and Ukraine could happen.</p>
            <p>He said, "I cannot imagine the next meeting happening without a ceasefire first. So, let us work for this and try to put pressure on Russia."</p>
            <p>Trump said that Russian President Putin agreed last week at the Alaska summit to give Ukraine safety promises. Trump called this a "very important step." He added, "This is one of the main things we need to think about. We will think about this during our talks, and also who will be responsible for what."</p>
            <p>He also said, "I think European countries will take a large part of the responsibility. We will help them and make sure they are safe."</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Zelenskyy said he had a "very good talk" with Trump earlier today. They talked about safety promises and helping people.</p>
            <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that Trump's promise to give safety guarantees to Ukraine was a "big step forward." It means progress in reaching a possible peace agreement for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that today's meeting with Trump could be a "historic step" for the safety of Ukraine and Europe.</p>
            <p>Finnish President Alexander Stubb praised Trump for making progress in the talks about the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
