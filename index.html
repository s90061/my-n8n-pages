            <h1>Taipei City: 4 Drinks and Ice Products Still Fail After Inspection</h1>
            <p>Taipei City's Health Department said today that they checked 118 drink and ice products in late April. They did this to make sure these items were clean and safe to eat. Even after businesses were told to fix problems, 4 products still had too many bad germs. This means 3.39% of the products failed the test.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Health Department held a regular press conference to share the results of their "Drink, Ice Product, and Ingredients Inspection Plan" from late April.</p>
            <p>Lin Guan-zhen, a section chief at the Health Department, said they took samples from many places. These included convenience stores, restaurants, coffee shops, bubble tea shops, ice cream and dessert shops, and food supply stores in Taipei.</p>
            <p>She explained that they tested 38 drinks, 25 ice products, 16 ice cubes, and 4 cooked ingredients. They checked for germs like Salmonella, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. These are all part of the food hygiene standards for germs.</p>
            <p>At the same time, they also checked 35 raw ingredients like tapioca pearls, nata de coco, tangyuan (rice balls), and taro balls. They looked for harmful things like preservatives, coloring agents, and sweeteners.</p>
            <p>Lin Guan-zhen said that 18 drink and ice products first failed the "Food Microorganism Hygiene Standards" test. Businesses were told to fix these problems. After a second check, 4 products (2 ice products and 2 drinks) still did not pass. According to the "Food Safety and Hygiene Management Act," the businesses responsible will have to pay a fine between NT$30,000 and NT$3,000,000.</p>
            <p>Lin Guan-zhen advised people to choose shops that are clean and have clean containers. Also, pick places with good cleaning, refrigeration, or freezing equipment. Workers should always be clean and have regular health checks. They should also wash their hands well. Shops should make sure their ingredients are made and stored cleanly. They should also keep records of where their ingredients come from. Lastly, shops should choose good water filters and ice-making machines and change the filters regularly to keep water safe.</p>

            <h1>AI Net-Zero: Da-Yeh University Offers 'Green Collar' Weekend Classes, Full Help for Low-Income Students</h1>
            <p>Going digital is now a common practice in industries. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and reaching net-zero carbon emissions are two big challenges for governments and companies. These are important for Taiwan's future growth. CNA's reporting team is looking closely at how the government and different industries are using AI. They are using AI to make work better and to create new green ideas. This shows how Taiwan's industries are growing again.</p>
            <p>Da-Yeh University and the National Institute of Environmental Research will start weekend classes in August. These classes are part of the Ministry of Environment's program to train "green collar" workers for net-zero goals. The classes will help students learn important skills like checking carbon emissions and managing greenhouse gases. Students under 30 will get half of their course fees paid. Low-income students will have all their fees paid.</p>
            <p>Chou Chung-chi, who is the head of the Environmental and Safety Engineering Department at Da-Yeh University, said today in a press release that companies around the world want to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This means managing carbon and developing sustainably are very important new skills. The Ministry of Environment's training program for green collar workers uses both university learning and real-world experience. It hopes to train more people in Taiwan for jobs in carbon management and sustainable development.</p>
            <p>The classes will teach both theory and practical skills. The total time for the course is 48 hours. Classes will be held every Saturday and Sunday from August 16 to September 7. Topics include climate change and managing greenhouse gases, practical carbon checking, voluntarily reducing greenhouse gases and trading carbon credits, and checking the carbon footprint of products.</p>
            <p>Chou Chung-chi said that green collar workers are now highly wanted in the job market. This is because carbon fees are starting, and international rules for sustainability are becoming more common. After finishing the Ministry of Environment's green collar training program, students will get a certificate from the National Institute of Environmental Research. This certificate will help them find jobs and get promotions.</p>
            <p>Da-Yeh University stated that the course costs NT$12,000. The Ministry of Environment offers financial help to encourage more young students and people in need to join. University students under 30 (not including those in part-time work programs) can apply for half of the cost, which means they pay NT$6,000. People from low-income families can get all their fees paid. You can sign up at https://greencollar.moenv.gov.tw/MajorLeagueClass/Index.</p>

            <h1>Recall Group Accuses Legislator Tu Quan-ji of Secret Law-Making; He Says He Focuses on Voters</h1>
            <p>The vote for the recall of a legislator will be on July 26. Today, the Taoyuan City Election Commission held a meeting to explain the recall. Chen Ting-wei, who is leading the recall effort, said that Legislator Tu Quan-ji is part of "black box" legislation. This means he helped make laws secretly and gave more power to the parliament in a bad way. Tu Quan-ji was not at the meeting, but he sent a statement saying that he puts the worries of his voters first.</p>
            <p>Today, a public TV meeting was held about the recall of Legislator Tu Quan-ji from Taoyuan City's second voting area. Chen Ting-wei attended the meeting. However, Tu Quan-ji did not come after his name was called three times, so he gave up his chance to speak.</p>
            <p>Chen Ting-wei said that Tu Quan-ji supported changing the law about how the Legislative Yuan works. This change would give the parliament more power to question and investigate. Chen said this goes too far, harms the idea of three separate government powers, and even takes away people's basic rights. Chen also said that Tu Quan-ji supported changing the recall law to make it harder to recall a politician. This means people's right to recall would be taken away. Chen asked how a leader who cannot be watched by the people can truly speak for them.</p>
            <p>Chen Ting-wei stated that Tu Quan-ji followed the orders of KMT legislator Fu Kun-chi. He said this made the parliament serve special political groups. The goal, Chen believes, is to make Taiwan weaker from the inside and lose its national strength.</p>
            <p>In his second turn to speak, Chen Ting-wei added that Tu Quan-ji rarely asked questions and his questions were empty. He also did not suggest any helpful ideas for his area. Chen repeated that Tu Quan-ji was part of secret law-making and helped the parliament gain too much power in a messy way. Chen claimed that for Tu Quan-ji, democracy is not a value but only a tool for fighting. People cannot accept a legislator who does nothing useful and only works with his party to break the system.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Tu Quan-ji released a statement. He said that the recall effort was never based on sensible discussion. Instead, he said it used fake news and bad rumors all the time. He said even after he sued, the other side kept spreading false information on flyers and social media, and they did not stop at all. Tu Quan-ji stated that instead of joining this "farce," his team chose to stick to their original goal. They went to different places and talked directly with voters. In the past few months, they have held hundreds of meetings in his voting area. He said they put the voters' worries first.</p>
            <p>Tu Quan-ji explained that his achievements and his answers to the recall rumors are clearly written in a nearly 4,000-word document called "Reasons Against the Recall." This document is in the voting bulletin. He also said he used flyers to share the truth. This is to make sure that everyone in the local area understands the facts and can make a wise choice.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission announced on June 20 that 24 recall cases for legislators have been approved. All of these are for KMT legislators. Also, the recall case for Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an, who is currently suspended, has also been approved. Voting and counting for these "24+1" recall cases will happen on July 26.</p>
