            <h1>US News: Trump Hopes Supreme Court Will Rule His Way on Tariffs; Case May Last Until Next Year.</h1>
            <p>A US federal court said that President Trump's use of a special law to add taxes on imports was not allowed. Many people are watching this situation. The "Wall Street Journal" reported that Trump feels positive about the outcome. He is hoping that the Supreme Court, which has many conservative judges, will agree with him. Because the government can still collect these taxes, the case might continue until winter or next spring.</p>
            <p>Seven judges in the federal court said that Trump's use of the 1977 "International Emergency Economic Powers Act" for an emergency was not valid. However, they said that the import taxes can continue until October 14. Countries, industries, and US businesses affected by these taxes are all waiting to see what happens next.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal noted that the White House always wants higher courts to solve disagreements. They are relying on the fact that most judges in the Supreme Court are conservative. Many lower courts have made decisions against Trump's government this year. But the Supreme Court will decide if Trump's use of power is right.</p>
            <p>It's easy to understand why the White House feels positive about the result. So far, over 20 court decisions have put short-term limits on Trump's government orders. The White House has asked the Supreme Court to step in, and in most of these cases, the Supreme Court's decisions have been what the government wanted.</p>
            <p>Three liberal judges in the Supreme Court did not agree with some decisions. But the court's rulings have allowed Trump to fire government workers, send some people out of the country quickly, stop money for research and education approved by Congress, and remove transgender soldiers from the military.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court's decisions might not last forever. However, because of legal procedures, the government can continue to carry out its orders for several months or even years.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal thinks that the Supreme Court's decision on the tariff case will be hard to predict. Trump's trade rules are different from what the Republican party usually believes about free trade. He also used executive orders to make changes without Congress. This gives people who sued him a chance to argue their case. The situation might not be good for the White House.</p>
            <p>The people suing over the tariffs are not only progressives and states led by Democrats. Small business owners, trade groups, and conservative groups have also joined. Many of these cases refer to Supreme Court decisions made during Joe Biden's time as president, saying that the previous government limited business too much.</p>
            <p>The final decision might take several months. Since the government can still collect the tariffs, the White House is not in a hurry to ask the Supreme Court for a clear decision before mid-October. This could happen in December or January next year. Then, oral arguments in court might happen in winter or next spring. The final decision will take even more weeks or months after that.</p>
            <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor for the White House, said on Fox Business News that six of the seven judges in the appeals court are Democrats. Also, 12 states led by Democrats are involved in the case.</p>
            <p>He stressed that many people are dying because of fentanyl, and the US has a growing trade problem. He said it's true that the US is in an emergency. Tariffs are tools to control imports. The Trump government never said they would last forever. If China and drug dealers stop harming the US, the tariffs will go away.</p>
            <p>Navarro believes that the disagreements in the appeals court give the Supreme Court a direction. He feels positive about how the case will end. He said that if they lose, it would be the end of the US, as Trump has said.</p>

            <h1>US Writer Talks About "Zero Day Attack" TV Show: It Shows Other Threatened Countries What to Do.</h1>
            <p>The TV show from Taiwan called "Zero Day Attack" is about China attacking Taiwan. It has caught the attention of people around the world. Elisabeth Braw, a writer for "Foreign Policy" magazine, says that "Zero Day Attack" can teach other countries that feel threatened. The things that happen in the show are important to think about now. This can help people in Taiwan be more ready.</p>
            <p>"Zero Day Attack" is a TV show about a war in the Taiwan Strait. It has 10 parts and shows events from different people's points of view. It started in Taiwan at the beginning of August. The show talks about many problems Taiwan might face. A group called the Global Taiwan Institute (GTI) in Washington will show "Zero Day Attack" for the first time in the US on September 4.</p>
            <p>Recently, Elisabeth Braw wrote an article titled "Can TV Help Prepare for Invasion?" She asked us to imagine a Chinese fleet suddenly appearing in the Taiwan Strait, checking all ships in that busy area. Or, she suggested, a Chinese warplane could crash near Taiwan, and Chinese warships could then block Taiwan, saying they are searching for the plane.</p>
            <p>She pointed out that the first idea (a Chinese fleet checking ships) really happened. The second idea (Chinese warships blocking Taiwan) is part of the TV show "Zero Day Attack." Besides being entertaining, the show also aims to warn people in Taiwan about a possible large-scale action from China.</p>
            <p>Braw, who also works as a senior researcher at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said clearly that as threats from China and Russia get closer, "these kinds of stories are also needed in places outside of Taiwan."</p>
            <p>In "Zero Day Attack," the Chinese military's search and rescue mission slowly turns into a complete blockade of Taiwan's waters and airspace. Then, Taiwan's internet starts to go down. When the internet stops working everywhere, the banking system also fails. People cannot use credit cards or mobile payments, and ATMs do not give out cash. The current president, who is about to leave office and give power to the new president, records a speech for the people. In it, he says strongly, "Without freedom, it is not Taiwan."</p>
            <p>The trailer for "Zero Day Attack" has been watched more than 2.5 million times. Braw says that for viewers outside Taiwan, it might just be a great TV show. But for Taiwanese people, the events in the show are "terrifyingly real."</p>
            <p>Braw noted that in 2023, when Kevin McCarthy, who was then the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, met with then-Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in California, China sent a naval fleet into the Taiwan Strait to patrol. In recent years, China has also done other acts against Taiwan. These include spreading false information, getting involved in elections, cyber attacks, suddenly stopping imports of Taiwanese food, and several times, undersea internet cables were cut in suspicious ways.</p>
            <p>Braw wrote that most Taiwanese people know their country is in danger. The Taiwanese government helped fund "Zero Day Attack" because they believe people still need to be reminded that threats will not only be about cut undersea cables and internet attacks.</p>
            <p>She thinks Taiwan is on the front line, but other countries can also learn from shows like this that teach and entertain. Like Taiwan, other democratic countries have also faced many kinds of attacks from unfriendly nations recently. These include cyber attacks, efforts to influence people, cutting undersea internet cables, interfering in elections, using immigrants as a weapon, and spy balloons. This makes it hard for governments. If voters don't know much about these attacks, how can governments convince them that more money is needed for defense?</p>
            <p>Braw said that about 10 years ago, a Norwegian TV show called "Occupied" had a similar effect on Norwegians as "Zero Day Attack" has on Taiwanese people. She said, "National security might be the best topic for entertainment." It has exciting drama.</p>
            <p>She said these might be scary futures, or sometimes situations that are not likely to happen. "But they are worth thinking about now." People in Taiwan can be better prepared. In most other countries, TV shows can also help teach people.</p>

            <h1>French Prime Minister Says Vote in Parliament Will Decide Country's Future.</h1>
            <p>The French Prime Minister, Francois Bayrou, said today that an upcoming vote of confidence will be very important for France's future. He called for this vote to solve a problem with the budget. People think his government, which does not have a majority of votes, will not pass this test.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Bayrou spoke to four news channels as the September 8 vote in parliament got closer. The opposition parties have already said they will not support his plan to cut spending.</p>
            <p>He stated that this vote in parliament will not decide "the prime minister's future," but "the future of France."</p>
            <p>Bayrou's government does not have a majority of seats in parliament. As he was trying to get enough support for his plan to cut spending, he announced on August 25 that there would be a vote of confidence in the divided parliament. This surprised many people in French politics.</p>
            <p>Bayrou, who is 74 years old, said in the interview, "The next few days are extremely important." He also said that he is not getting ready to "say goodbye," even though the opposition wants him to.</p>
            <p>Bayrou criticized some political groups in France for trying to create "disorder." He specifically mentioned Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the far-left party.</p>
            <p>Since August 25, he has wanted to talk with the opposition parties. His condition was that they agree to spending cuts to reduce France's debt. However, the opposition said it was too late.</p>
