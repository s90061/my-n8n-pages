            <h1>Basketball EuroBasket: Turkey Defeats Poland to Reach the Semi-finals</h1>
            <p>Turkey beat Poland 91 to 77 in the EuroBasket quarter-finals. This was Turkey's seventh win in a row, which is a record for the team in this competition.</p>
            <p>The EuroBasket website said that this is the second time Turkey has reached the semi-finals. Next, they will play against the winner of the game between Greece and Lithuania.</p>
            <p>Poland started the game very well. In the first 10 minutes, they stopped Turkey's center, Alperen Sengun, from scoring any points. But when he scored, it changed the game. The crowd became excited, and Poland's plans for the game fell apart.</p>
            <p>After Sengun made a dunk, Turkey scored 22 points to Poland's 10. By halftime, Turkey's lead grew from just one point to 46-32.</p>
            <p>Poland tried their best to make the game closer. But with only 3 minutes left in the game, they could only get within 8 points of Turkey.</p>
            <p>Alperen Sengun, who is 23 years old, scored 19 points. He also got 12 rebounds and 10 assists. He stole the ball 3 times. This NBA player played very well. This was his seventh time in this EuroBasket tournament getting at least 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists.</p>
            <p>But it was not an easy win for Turkey. Cedi Osman got hurt in his leg. This happened when he tried to block a shot from Mateusz Ponitka. Osman left the game in the middle of the third quarter but came back to play when there were 5 minutes left.</p>
            <p>Poland fought hard until the end. This was the second time in a row they reached the EuroBasket quarter-finals. But they could not finish in fourth place again, like they did in 2022. Mateusz Ponitka scored 19 points, had 6 assists, and got 6 rebounds. However, he could not stop his team from losing.</p>

            <h1>European Stocks Mostly Go Up as People Expect US Interest Rate Cuts to Help Economy</h1>
            <p>Most stock markets in Europe closed higher today. This happened because people believe that the US central bank, called the Federal Reserve (Fed), will lower interest rates. People think this will help the American economy.</p>
            <p>This idea that interest rates will go down was more powerful than the recent political problems in France and Japan.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up a little, by 21.09 points. This is a 0.23% increase, and it closed at 9242.53 points.</p>
            <p>However, the DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 88.68 points, which is a 0.37% decrease. It closed at 23718.45 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went up a small amount, by 14.55 points. This is a 0.19% increase, and it closed at 7749.39 points.</p>

            <h1>Egypt and Israel Sign Huge Gas Deal, Changing the World's Energy Map</h1>
            <p>In early August, Israel and Egypt announced that they would sign a natural gas export deal. The deal is worth 35 billion US dollars, which is about 1.06 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. They plan to sign it very soon.</p>
            <p>Experts in global energy say this is the biggest natural gas export deal Israel has ever made. It will make Israel a very strong energy country in the Middle East. It will also make the Eastern Mediterranean Sea area a main place for energy in the world.</p>
            <p>News reports say that the deal uses natural gas from Israel's Leviathan gas field. The plan is to send about 130 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Egypt by the year 2040. This will help Egypt with its energy problems and make their energy partnership stronger.</p>
            <p>The year 2023 was a very difficult year for electricity in Egypt. Many Egyptians remember that they had power cuts every day during the summer. Sometimes the electricity was off for four hours a day. The hot weather made it hard to sleep, and a lot of fresh food went bad because it could not be kept cold.</p>
            <p>The main reasons for Egypt's big power cuts were two things. First, more people meant more demand for electricity. Second, the Zohr oil field, which was found in 2015, started to produce less gas. This meant there was not enough electricity. So, in 2020, Egypt started to get natural gas from Israel.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Israel found the Tamar gas field in 2009 and the Leviathan gas field in 2010. In the next ten years, Israel changed from a country that bought energy to a country that sells a lot of energy. More than 90% of the gas from the Leviathan field is sold to Egypt and Jordan.</p>
            <p>In 2005, Egypt opened a pipeline from Arish to Ashkelon to send natural gas to Israel. But after 2011, fighters in the Sinai Peninsula often attacked this pipeline. Because of this, the agreement to send gas broke. Since 2020, the gas in the same pipeline has flowed the other way. Now, Israel sends gas to Egypt.</p>
            <p>In February 2022, Russia attacked Ukraine. Because of this, the European Union (EU) stopped buying natural gas from Russia as a punishment. Then, the EU made a deal with Egypt and Israel. Israel gives natural gas, which is made into liquid gas in Egypt. Then, this liquid gas is sent from Egypt to Europe.</p>
            <p>One reason for Egypt's big power cuts in 2023 was that the Egyptian government needed to get money to help its struggling economy. So, they chose to sell natural gas to Europe to earn US dollars. This meant that Egypt, which gets 90% of its electricity from natural gas, did not have enough gas to make power.</p>
            <p>Mamdouh Salameh, a global expert in oil and energy, told Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN) that Egypt has modern facilities in Idku and Damietta. These are the only places in the Eastern Mediterranean that can change natural gas into liquid natural gas. Then, this liquid gas can be sent to Europe and Asia. He also said that building a pipeline to send gas directly from Israeli gas fields to Europe would cost more than a trillion dollars. So, the best idea is for Israel and Egypt to work together to provide gas to Europe.</p>
            <p>MBN also reported that Marian Wahba, a researcher from a think tank in Washington called the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said the 35 billion dollar deal will help Egypt become a main country for selling liquid natural gas. It will also make Israel the new main energy player in the Eastern Mediterranean region. This will help Europe not rely so much on Russian natural gas and get its energy from different countries.</p>
            <p>The report also said that according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Eastern Mediterranean has a lot of natural gas that can be taken out, more than 122 trillion cubic feet. This has made many big oil companies around the world want to work in this area.</p>
            <p>Ghaith al-Omari, a researcher at the Washington Institute, told MBN that the Eastern Mediterranean is now a very important point in the world's energy system.</p>
            <p>Al-Omari also said that this new deal between Egypt and Israel about the Leviathan gas field is not just about money. It is also an alliance because of energy. It makes natural gas a way to create stability and teamwork in the region. By working together, Egypt and Israel can change the balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
