US stocks turned mostly lower on Friday as investors navigated a flurry of developments across multiple fronts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq erased earlier gains. Traders are weighing the possibility of direct US military involvement in the Israel-Iran war, now in its second week. Other market influences include expectations for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and ongoing tensions between the US and China over chip technology.

**Masa Son Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is trying to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to create what could be his biggest investment yet: a trillion-dollar industrial center for artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States. SoftBank officials are keen for TSMC, a top maker of advanced AI chips, to play a key role. This comes as TSMC has already announced plans for $165 billion in US investments and has started mass production at its first factory in Arizona. Son has also prepared a list of SoftBank Vision Fund companies that could be part of this Arizona manufacturing hub.
