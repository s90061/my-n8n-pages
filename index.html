            <h1>Thailand and Cambodia Fight for Two Days; Cambodia Asks for Immediate Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>New York, United Nations Headquarters, July 25 (AFP) â€“ After two days of fighting with Thailand that caused deaths and injuries, Cambodia's ambassador to the United Nations said today that Cambodia wants "an immediate stop to the fighting." Thailand also said it is ready to talk.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the long-standing border disagreement between Thailand and Cambodia got worse on July 24. Both sides used warplanes, cannons, tanks, and soldiers on the ground. This made the UN Security Council hold an urgent meeting today about the problem.</p>
            <p>Cambodia's Ambassador to the UN, Chhea Keo, spoke after a closed meeting of the Security Council where both Cambodia and Thailand were present. He said, "Cambodia asks for an immediate stop to the fighting without any conditions. We also ask for a peaceful way to solve the problem."</p>
            <p>Thailand's Ministry of Health said that over 138,000 people have moved away from the border areas. They reported 15 deaths (14 civilians, 1 soldier) and 46 injuries (15 of them soldiers).</p>
            <p>The Thai army said that at 4 AM local time on July 25, the two sides fought again in three areas. Cambodia used heavy weapons, field cannons, and BM-21 multiple rocket systems. The Thai army responded with "suitable force."</p>
            <p>Nikorndej Balankura, a spokesperson for Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told AFP that the fighting seemed to slow down by the afternoon of July 25. He also said that Thailand is open to talks, and Malaysia might help them talk.</p>
            <p>He said, "If Cambodia wants to solve the problem through talking with diplomats, direct talks, or even with help from Malaysia, we are ready. But we have not heard back from Cambodia yet." Nikorndej said this to AFP before the urgent meeting of the Security Council.</p>

            <h1>Trump Arrives in Scotland, Will Meet UK and EU Leaders</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 25 (CNA reporter Hou Ziying) â€“ US President Donald Trump arrived in Scotland today for a visit. He will meet leaders from the United Kingdom and the European Union. Trump said that on July 27, he will meet with EU representatives to see if they can make a trade deal. Currently, there might be as many as 20 different issues they don't agree on.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump will visit Scotland from today until July 29, going to Turnberry and Aberdeen. He is expected to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Before leaving the White House this morning, Trump told the media that he would meet with Starmer to talk about the trade deal they made before. However, after arriving in Scotland, he then said that since the deal is already made, "we will have a meeting about other topics outside of the deal."</p>
            <p>Also, when Trump was asked by reporters in Scotland, he said that on July 27, he will meet with EU representatives "to see if we can reach a deal." He added, "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will come here, and we are looking forward to it."</p>
            <p>He also said there is about a 50/50 chance of making a deal with the EU. The main problems might be about as many as 20 different topics.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Von der Leyen wrote on social media platform X: "After a good talk with the President of the United States, we agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss the trade relationship between the US and Europe and how to keep it strong."</p>
            <p>Recently, the British newspaper "Financial Times" reported, citing people who know the situation, that the EU and the US are close to making a trade deal. This deal might put a 15% tax on goods coming into Europe, similar to a deal Trump made with Japan this week.</p>
            <p>In early April, Trump put in place "equal tariffs" (extra taxes). Earlier this month, he signed an order to delay these tariffs until August 1st. This was to give countries more time to talk with the US. But at the same time, he sent letters about tariffs to more than 20 countries he trades with, including the EU. He said that from August 1st, he might put a 30% tax on EU goods coming into the US. (Editor: Chen Yiwei) 1140726</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Fall as US Trade Talks with Countries Are Still Not Clear</h1>
            <p>New York, July 25 (AFP) â€“ Oil prices went down today. This happened because the US dollar became stronger, and people were less confident that the United States would make deals with its main trade partners before next week's deadline.</p>
            <p>In the New York market, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September went down by 1.3%. It closed at $65.16 per barrel.</p>
            <p>In the London market, the price of Brent crude oil for September went down by 1.1%. It closed at $68.44 per barrel. (Translator: Hsu Rueichen / Editor: Chen Yiwei) 1140726</p>
