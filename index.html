            <h1>Trump Puts More Pressure on the Federal Reserve, Asks Board Member Cook to Resign Right Away</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 20 ‚Äì News from many foreign sources: US President Trump recently criticized Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve (Fed), for not lowering interest rates sooner. Today, Trump put more pressure on the Fed. He posted a message asking Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed board, to leave her job immediately.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Donald Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social: "Cook must resign now!" He also shared a news story from Bloomberg News. The story was about Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte had asked for an investigation into Cook for two mortgage loans.</p>
            <p>Pulte is a strong supporter of Trump. Reports say that he has sent a letter to the US Attorney General. He suggested that Cook might have committed a crime and asked for an investigation into her.</p>
            <p>It is not yet clear if such an investigation will happen.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve has not changed its main lending rate this year. Before Trump focused on Cook, a member of the Fed's committee that decides interest rates, he had often criticized Jerome Powell.</p>
            <p>Cook became a member of the Federal Reserve board in May 2022. She was appointed again in September the next year and started her new term that same month. Her term will end in 2038.</p>

            <h1>Pixel 10 Series Uses TSMC 3nm Chip for the First Time to Compete in AI Phone Market</h1>
            <p>New York, August 20 ‚Äì Special report by CNA reporter Chang Hsin-Yu: Google held a global event today in New York to show its new hardware products. The main phone, the Pixel 10 series, has its own AI chip called Tensor G5. This chip is made using TSMC's 3-nanometer technology. This is the biggest improvement ever for Google's mobile device chips. Google hopes to get a bigger share of the AI phone market by offering smoother and more natural AI features.</p>
            <p>Last year was the start of AI phones. After Google's Pixel 9 series, other brands like Apple with its iPhone 16 series and Samsung with its Galaxy S25 series also made AI features standard. Each company has special software and hardware features.</p>
            <p>Google products have an advantage because they are "AI native." This means they can connect their own chips, the Gemini AI model, the Android operating system, and cloud services. This allows hardware and software to work together very well. This is the biggest difference between Google and other brands.</p>
            <p>This year, Google made big improvements to its chips. In the past, Google worked with Samsung for the design and making of the chips. But now, Google is in charge of designing the Tensor G5. It uses TSMC's advanced 3-nanometer process, which is a big change.</p>
            <p>The better chip also makes the phone's AI much stronger. Here are some of the best AI features of the Google Pixel 10 series:</p>
            <p>‚óè Voice AI Assistant Gets Better: It Can Mark Important Things and Talk More Like a Real Person</p>
            <p>The Gemini Live voice AI assistant in the Pixel 10 series has a new "visual overlay" feature. It uses the camera or screen to see what the user sees. Then, it can mark key objects or information on the screen to give immediate help. This feature can be used in many situations. For example, if you are driving in another country and don't understand the road signs, you can use it to know if you can park there.</p>
            <p>Also, Gemini Live uses a "native audio model" to make conversations more natural. The AI can sense how the user feels and change its tone and answers. This feature works in Taiwan and supports Traditional Chinese.</p>
            <p>‚óè Live Call Translation: Keeps Your Voice Sound Similar</p>
            <p>The Voice Translate feature in the Pixel 10 series can translate calls right away. It also uses a technology to keep the sound of your voice. This means the translated voice will sound similar to yours. Google explained in an online press conference that this technology does not copy voices. It does not create a lasting voice model, and it will not save voices for later use.</p>
            <p>This feature will first support translation from English to Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, French, Swedish, Russian, Indonesian, Japanese, and Hindi. Japanese and Hindi will be available as a test version. Google says it will add more languages in the future.</p>
            <p>‚óè Magic Cue: An AI Assistant That Knows What You Need</p>
            <p>The new "Magic Cue" feature is like a more "active" AI assistant. It looks for and suggests useful information from different apps based on what the user is doing. For example, if someone asks for your flight booking details, it can "automatically" find the correct flight number from your Gmail inbox.</p>
            <p>Google said that when people work, they often have to switch between apps to find documents, emails, and calendars. Magic Cue can get important information from different apps and put it all together quickly. This helps give suggestions that are very useful.</p>
            <p>Magic Cue works with both Google's own apps and other apps. Right now, it is only available in the US and some English-speaking areas.</p>
            <p>‚óè Pro Series Models Get 1 Year of Free Google AI Pro Service, Worth NT$7,800</p>
            <p>Google today launched four main Pixel 10 series phones. Besides the basic Pixel 10 model, the other three Pro series models come with a free 1-year Google AI Pro plan. In Taiwan, the current monthly price for this plan is NT$650. So, this free offer is worth NT$7,800. After the trial period, users will need to pay, but they can cancel their subscription at any time.</p>
            <p>The Google AI Pro plan includes generative AI tools like Imagen 4 and Veo 3. Veo 3 can turn text into videos. The plan also gives 2TB of cloud storage and increases the limits for using the NotebookLM writing assistant.</p>
