            <h1>European Stocks Close Higher, Led by Drug Companies</h1>
            <p>On October 1st, European stock markets finished the day with higher prices. This happened even though the U.S. government had to stop some services because politicians could not agree on a spending plan. Drug companies helped the market go up.</p>
            <p>This rise followed news that the drug company Pfizer agreed to make its medicine cheaper in the United States. Because of this, Pfizer was allowed to avoid some special taxes that the former president, Mr. Trump, had put in place.</p>
            <p>In London, the FTSE 100 stock index went up by 96.00 points, or 1.03%. It closed at 9446.43 points.</p>
            <p>In Frankfurt, the DAX index went up by 232.90 points, or 0.98%. It closed at 24113.62 points.</p>
            <p>In Paris, the CAC 40 index went up by 71.01 points, or 0.90%. It closed at 7966.95 points.</p>

            <h1>Scaffolding Accident at Ethiopia Church: 36 Dead, Over 200 Hurt</h1>
            <p>State media in Ethiopia, a country in East Africa, reported that a temporary wooden structure (scaffolding) at a church fell today. This accident killed at least 36 people and injured more than 200 others.</p>
            <p>The news agency AFP said the accident happened around 7:45 AM local time. It took place in Arerti town, which is about 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) east of Addis Ababa, the capital city. Many people were there for the yearly festival to celebrate Saint Mary.</p>
            <p>Ahmed Gebeyehu, the local police chief, spoke to the state-owned Fana Broadcasting Corporation. He said, "The number of people who have died has reached 36, and it might go up." He also said that over 200 people were hurt and have been taken to a local hospital for help.</p>
            <p>Another local official, Atnafu Abate, told the state media company Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) that some people are still stuck under the fallen scaffolding. He added that some people with very serious injuries have been moved to hospitals in the capital city. However, he did not give more information about the people who are still trapped or any possible rescue plans.</p>
            <p>EBC showed pictures on its official Facebook page. The photos showed many wooden poles from the scaffolding lying everywhere in a messy way. Crowds of people gathered among the fallen pieces. Other photos of the outside of the church showed that the scaffolding was built in a way that looked unsafe.</p>

            <h1>Part of 20-Story Building Collapses in New York After Gas Explosion; No Injuries Reported Yet</h1>
            <p>Today in New York City's Bronx area, a gas explosion was reported in a 20-story building where people live. A whole corner of the building fell down. Emergency workers are at the site. The New York City Fire Department said that no one has reported any injuries yet.</p>
            <p>CBS News reported that the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) said the explosion happened around 8:10 AM local time. It took place at the Mitchel Houses, a group of buildings in the Bronx.</p>
            <p>Because of the explosion, many bricks and other parts of the building fell onto nearby buildings and the sidewalk. It looked like water was coming out of the ground, which might mean water pipes were broken. Firefighters can be seen looking through the fallen parts of the building. They are also using drones (small flying machines) and police dogs to check if anyone is trapped inside.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the fire department got calls saying a gas explosion caused the incinerator shaft (a part of the building used for burning trash) in the 20-story building to fall apart. Officials said that no apartments in the building were affected. This building is public housing, meaning it is owned by the city government.</p>
            <p>Pictures from the scene show that one corner of the tall building, from the ground all the way to the roof, completely collapsed. Videos taken by people living nearby show a big cloud of dust covering the street right after the collapse, which happened around 8:10 AM.</p>
            <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams said that he has been told about the situation, and officials are still checking everything. On social media, he asked people: "For your safety, please do not go to the area where this happened."</p>
            <p>The report explained that incinerator shafts in New York City buildings were used in the past to burn trash inside the building. Now, they can still use the old openings, but usually, trash is processed by machines that press it together (trash compactors).</p>
