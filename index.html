(CNA reporter Chang Yi-lian, Kinmen, July 6) Typhoon Danas is coming. This morning, Kinmen County's disaster center started its highest level of response. For travel, the ferry service between Kinmen and Xiamen will stop before 10 AM tomorrow. The ferry service between Kinmen and Quanzhou will be stopped all day. All local flights for tomorrow morning are canceled.

The Kinmen Port Authority announced on Facebook today that due to the typhoon, the Kinmen-Xiamen ferry line will stop before 10 AM tomorrow from Shuitou, Kinmen, to Wutong, Xiamen. They will announce when it starts again later. The Kinmen-Quanzhou ferry line from Shuitou, Kinmen, to Shijing, Quanzhou, will be stopped all day.

The Kinmen County Fire Department said the disaster center started its highest level at 9 AM. County Mayor Chen Fu-hai asked Premier Cho Jung-tai for two things. First, he asked the central government to put power and communication lines underground faster on islands like Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu. Second, he asked Taipower and Chunghwa Telecom to send rescue teams and vehicles to the islands before the typhoon. This is because islands might lose transport and communication during the typhoon. Premier Cho said all ministries should help Kinmen and other islands prepare for disasters. He stressed that working together will keep people safe. The Fire Department also said the typhoon's strong winds will be near Kinmen from tonight until tomorrow morning. They expect 50 to 100 millimeters of rain. Winds will be 5 to 6 on average, with gusts of 8 to 9. The sea will have big waves, over 3 meters high, and long waves are possible. Coastal areas should be ready for flooding from the sea. After the disaster center started, all coastlines, Mount Taiwu, and all inland lakes in Kinmen are now restricted areas. People cannot enter without special passes. If they do, they will pay a fine of NT$50,000 to NT$250,000. For Kinmen Bridge, the Kinmen County Tourism Department said that if winds reach 6 (average) or 8 (gusts), motorcycles should not use the bridge, and bicycles and people are not allowed. If winds reach 8 (average), cars should not use the bridge, and motorcycles, bicycles, and people are not allowed.

**Japan Might Give Used Warships to the Philippines; Philippine Navy Says They Are Useful**

(CNA reporter Lin Hsing-chien, Manila, July 6) Japanese news said Japan will sell old warships that can fight submarines to the Philippines. This will help the Philippines against China's growing power at sea. The Philippine Navy said today that these warships are good for their needs. They will send people to Japan to see them and decide if they want to buy them.

Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper today said, citing unnamed government sources, that Japan plans to sell six Abukuma-class warships. These ships have been used by Japan's navy for over 30 years. The newspaper also said that Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro agreed on this plan when they met in Singapore in June.

The Philippine Navy said today that Japan's Defense Ministry asked them to inspect the warships. They will send experts to Japan to check the ships and decide if they will buy them. The navy said that Abukuma-class warships are made to fight submarines and other ships. They are known to be strong and can do many things, which is what the Philippine Navy needs to protect its waters. The Philippine Navy said this plan shows that their partnership with Japan is getting stronger. It also shows that both countries want to work together for sea safety and peace in the area. Japan and China are arguing about who owns the Diaoyutai Islands. Also, the Philippines and China often have problems in the South China Sea. Because of these sea threats, the Philippines and Japan are working closer together in defense. Last July, they signed an agreement that lets their forces visit each other's countries. The Philippines was the first Asian country to sign such a deal with Japan. Also, the coast guard and navy of the Philippines, the US, and Japan often do joint exercises in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

**60,000 People Sign Petition in Lithuania After Cruel Dog Abuse Case; They Want Harsher Punishments**

(CNA reporter Yu Yao-ru, Vilnius, July 6) Recently, a dog was badly beaten and buried alive in Lithuania, but it was saved. This made many people worried. Animal welfare groups and people are asking the government to punish animal abuse more strictly. So far, almost 60,000 people have signed a petition asking for stronger laws.

Lithuania's national radio (LRT) reported that in mid-June, a dog named Gaus was badly beaten and then buried alive in Ariogala, a town in central Lithuania. Luckily, the police helped save the dog. Jurgita Gustaitiene, who leads the animal protection group Nuaras in Lithuania, said this was one of the cruelest animal abuse cases she has seen in many years.

Gustaitiene explained that Lithuania's current laws for animal abuse are not clear enough. This makes it hard to use criminal law in some cases. Even if an animal is badly hurt but does not die, most times the abuser only gets a fine, not a criminal charge. Police records show that this year, Lithuania has had 7 criminal cases where animals were seriously hurt or died. Last year, there were 25 such cases, and the year before, there were 46. This shows fewer serious cases over time. However, there are 52 cases of abuse that only get fines, which is a little more than last year's 46 cases. According to Lithuania's law on fines, if an animal is at risk of death or being disabled, the abuser can be fined from 900 to 3200 Euros. If an animal dies or is seriously hurt, the law can give community service, a fine, a short prison stay, or up to one year in prison. But animal welfare people say the current laws offer too many other punishments. This means abusers rarely go to prison. Asta StrazdienÄ—, an activist who has worked for animal rights for a long time, said that even if the prison sentence is 1 or 2 years, courts often choose fines or other punishments. This makes the punishment less effective. She thinks the prison time should be increased to 4 years to give law enforcement more power to punish. The people who started this petition want the lowest fine to be 6000 Euros and a prison sentence of at least 2 years. Over 60,000 people have signed to support this. The petition will close in mid-October and then be given to Lithuania's National Food and Veterinary Service (VMVT) and the Lithuanian Parliament to discuss.
