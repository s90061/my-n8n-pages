            <h1>Typhoon Kagasa Stops Sea and Air Travel; Penghu County Adds Flights to Taipei on September 23</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Kagasa is coming closer. All flights and boats between Taiwan and Penghu are cancelled today. The Penghu County government has asked Mandarin Airlines to add one extra flight to Taipei tomorrow. This is to help people who are stuck. For flights to Kaohsiung, they will check how many people are waiting tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Penghu Airport said that because of Typhoon Kagasa, all domestic flights were cancelled after noon today. A total of 29 flights were cancelled. About 1,800 people who had booked flights are affected.</p>
            <p>Penghu Airport also said that all flights and boats between Taiwan and Penghu will go back to normal on September 23. Right now, about half of the seats are booked for these routes. Travelers who were stuck because of the typhoon can likely get on flights by waiting for open spots.</p>
            <p>However, more than 100 people are waiting for flights to Taipei. So, in the evening, the Penghu County government asked Mandarin Airlines to add two more flights between Taipei and Penghu on September 23. These flights will be at 9:45 AM and 11:35 AM. You can book tickets on their website now. For Kaohsiung flights, they will decide tomorrow based on how many people are still waiting.</p>

            <h1>Warren Buffett Sells All BYD Shares After 17 Years; Stock Price Went Up 3890%</h1>
            <p>Warren Buffett's investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, has sold all its shares in BYD, a large Chinese electric car company. During the 17 years that Berkshire Hathaway owned these shares, BYD's stock price increased by 3890%.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a US business news company, reported that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought 225 million shares of BYD in Hong Kong in 2008. They paid 230 million US dollars. At that time, this was about 10% of all BYD shares. Charlie Munger, who was the Vice Chairman then, strongly suggested this investment.</p>
            <p>Berkshire Hathaway started selling its BYD shares in August 2022. By June last year, they had sold almost 76% of their shares. This made their ownership less than 5% of BYD's total shares. Today, Li Yunfei, BYD's General Manager for Brand and Public Relations, also confirmed this news on Weibo.</p>
            <p>Li Yunfei wrote, "When you invest in stocks, buying and selling is normal!" He also thanked Munger and Buffett for believing in BYD, and for their investment, help, and support over the past 17 years. Charlie Munger passed away at the end of November 2023.</p>
            <p>CNBC said that during the years Berkshire Hathaway owned BYD shares, the stock price went up by about 3890%.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, a company called Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which is part of Berkshire Hathaway, owned these BYD shares. Its financial report for the first quarter of this year showed that the value of this investment was zero by March 31.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Berkshire Hathaway also said that all BYD shares have indeed been sold.</p>
            <p>Buffett has not yet explained why Berkshire Hathaway started selling its BYD shares. However, he told CNBC in 2023 that BYD is an "amazing company" run by "amazing people." But he added, "I think we will find a better way to use this money."</p>

            <h1>New Taipei City Cancels Ban-Shu Social Housing Project; National Land Agency to Keep 5% Land for Social Housing in Flood Control Plan</h1>
            <p>News reports say that a plan to build social housing in New Taipei City, between Banqiao and Shulin, has been stopped. This is because there is construction waste underground. The National Land Management Agency confirmed this today. They also said that these two areas will become part of the Shulin Flood Control Phase 3 development plan. In this new plan, 5% of the land will still be saved for building social housing first, as required by law.</p>
            <p>News reported that the National Land Management Agency originally planned to build social housing on two pieces of government land. These lands are in the Shulin Flood Control Phase 3 development area, between Banqiao and Shulin. However, tests showed a lot of construction waste underground. Removing this waste would be very expensive and take a long time, so the timing was not clear. Because of this, they decided to cancel the plan with the New Taipei City Urban Planning Committee.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency of the Ministry of the Interior said in a press release today that the two sites, "Banqiao-4" and "Banqiao-19," have buried waste. Because it would take too long to remove the waste, it would not be possible to build social housing on time. So, the New Taipei City Urban Planning Committee agreed to cancel the plan on August 22 this year.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency stated that these two sites will be included in the larger Shulin Flood Control Phase 3 development area. By law, 5% of the land in this new development will still be set aside for social housing first.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency also said that the central government has already built 9 social housing projects with 1,341 homes in Banqiao and Shulin, New Taipei City. They will continue to look for land owned by the government or public companies. They will also get land for social housing through development plans, urban renewal, or building bonuses. This way, they can offer more housing support to people.</p>
