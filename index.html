            <h1>Customs Agency Works Harder to Stop False Origin Claims, Asks Public for Help</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration announced on August 26 that it has seen cases where goods made in China are being falsely labeled as "made in Taiwan" to change their origin. The Customs Administration asks people to report any local companies they think are doing this. They should provide clear evidence to help customs officers check. This will help keep trade fair and protect Taiwan's national interests.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration held a regular press conference. Deputy Director-General Chao Tai-an said that from April 1 to August 17 this year, customs checked 12,537 shipments sent to the U.S. Of these, 156 cases were sent to the Bureau of Foreign Trade. The Bureau of Foreign Trade has given fines totaling NT$2.64 million, depending on how serious the cases were.</p>
            <p>Chao Tai-an noted that exports have continued to reach new high levels since April. However, the number of cases sent to the Bureau of Foreign Trade has not gone up a lot. This means that with more exports, the percentage of problem cases is likely lower.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration said that customs will keep checking more often. They also ask people to report any local companies they think are falsely changing the origin of goods. People should provide clear evidence to help customs officers check. This will help keep trade fair and protect Taiwan's national interests.</p>
            <p>The Customs Administration explained that when someone reports a case of illegal re-shipment to customs, they can do so in writing, by speaking, by phone, by fax, or by other ways. They must provide their own information (name, ID number, and contact address or phone number) and the information of the company or person they are reporting (name, ID or passport number, or company name, tax ID, and address if it's a company). They also need to provide details about how the goods were re-shipped (name of goods, quantity, shipping method) or other clear evidence that customs can use to check (transaction papers, shipping documents, or related information). If any information is missing, customs will ask the person to provide it by a certain date. If the information is not provided on time, the report cannot be accepted.</p>
            <p>The Customs Administration reminds businesses to follow the rules to protect Taiwan's good name in exports and its trade interests. They should not do anything illegal to re-ship goods so they do not break the law. The agency also encourages people to report illegal activities. This way, the public and the government can work together to stop bad companies. Customs will keep all report information strictly secret by law.</p>

            <h1>Japan Strongly Protests as China Builds 21st Structure in East China Sea Oil Field</h1>
            <p>The Japanese government announced that it has found a new structure built by China in a disputed part of the East China Sea. This structure is for developing oil and gas fields. Japan has protested strongly to China. According to Kyodo News, this is the 21st Chinese structure Japan has found in that area.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Japanese Foreign Ministry said last night that they have confirmed China built a new structure on China's side of the line in the East China Sea. Japan is very unhappy about China's actions alone and has sent a strong protest to the Chinese Embassy.</p>
            <p>The Foreign Ministry stated, "It is very regrettable that China is moving forward with development on its own."</p>
            <p>The Foreign Ministry also said it has "strongly protested" to the Chinese Embassy.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that China has now built 21 structures that look like drilling platforms. Tokyo is worried that China is also taking natural gas from Japan's side.</p>
            <p>The Foreign Ministry also said it "strongly urges China to restart talks soon" about putting into action the 2008 agreement between Japan and China. This agreement is about developing resources in the East China Sea.</p>
            <p>Based on this agreement, Japan and China agreed to work together to develop natural gas resources under the sea in the disputed area. The agreement also said that neither side could explore alone.</p>
            <p>However, talks about how to make the agreement work have stopped since 2010.</p>

            <h1>Trump Fires Fed Official and Threatens to Limit Chip Exports; Most Asian Stocks Fall</h1>
            <p>On August 26, Hong Kong reported that former U.S. President Trump announced several actions that worried the market. These included the rare firing of a Federal Reserve official and threats to control chip exports. Because of this, most Asian stock markets closed lower today.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that last night, Donald Trump announced he had fired Lisa Cook, an official on the Federal Reserve Board. He said she was accused of giving false information on mortgage documents.</p>
            <p>Last night, Trump also promised to put "very large extra taxes" on goods from countries that do not remove their digital taxes and rules. He said these rules were "made to hurt" American technology.</p>
            <p>He also threatened to stop the export of "highly protected (American) technology and chips." He did not give more details.</p>
            <p>Market confidence grew a lot after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech on August 22 that interest rates might be lowered in the future.</p>
            <p>But yesterday, the hopeful feeling on Wall Street seemed to fade. People are now focusing on the financial report from the big artificial intelligence (AI) chip company NVIDIA, which will be announced this week. There is growing worry about a "tech bubble," and NVIDIA is a key indicator for this industry.</p>
            <p>Now, everyone is also looking forward to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report, which will be released on August 28. Also important is the main inflation report on August 29. These reports will help predict if interest rates will be lowered and by how much in the coming months.</p>
            <p>Asian stock markets mostly closed a little lower today, following the falls in New York and European markets yesterday.</p>
            <p>Tokyo's main stock index fell more clearly, closing down 0.97%. Stock markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, and Sydney also closed lower, while Taipei's stock market closed slightly higher.</p>
