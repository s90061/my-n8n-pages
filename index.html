**Tainan's 3 City-Protected Historic Buildings Shine with New Lights at Night**

Tainan has shown the first results of its project to improve city lighting for its 400th anniversary. The city announced today that three city-protected historical buildings â€“ the Tainan State Assembly, the Tainan Joint Office Building, and the Tainan Patriotic Women's Association Hall â€“ now have improved night lighting. This makes these old buildings look beautiful at night.

The Tainan Cultural Heritage Management Office said today that the new lighting uses modern technology to connect the old buildings with the city's areas. The lighting at the State Assembly and Joint Office Building uses special light programming. The light paths connect to other important places like the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, Tainan Art Museum, Confucius Temple area, and more, extending to the Patriotic Women's Association Hall.

Each of the three buildings shows different features with the new lighting. At the Tainan State Assembly, the lights are hidden inside the building's structure. They create a soft glow on the brick walls, highlighting the mix of Japanese and Western architectural styles.

At the Tainan Joint Office Building, lights outline the round windows and the building's shape. Horizontal light lines go to the fire station, tourist center, and history museum, bringing back the look of the old covered walkways on Minsheng Road.

The Patriotic Women's Association Hall has warm yellow lights shining through its windows. With shadows from trees in the yard and path lights, it creates a peaceful and soft feeling at night.

The Cultural Heritage Office will continue to improve the lighting at four national historical sites, including Wumiao Temple and Grand Matsu Temple, and four more city-protected historical sites. This will make Tainan's old city show its mix of old and new culture and its beautiful night scenes through light and shadow.

**Eslite Stationery Fair: Freshly Cut Erasers and Popular Poster Lamps Attract Attention**

Eslite Bookstore has started its "Ideal Stationery" exhibition today. Visitors can enjoy fun activities like getting erasers cut for them and filling a box with paper tape. Companies from Japan, Korea, and Germany are also part of the event. A popular poster lamp designed by Japanese artist unpis is drawing a lot of attention.

Hsieh Shu-ching, Marketing Director of Eslite Bookstore, told CNA that for their yearly stationery exhibition, "Ideal Stationery," they work with an artist each time. This year, they asked unpis to create over 100 special items with Eslite. This is unpis's biggest special project as a graphic designer. He used his creativity to mix stationery with imaginative ideas, like a witch riding a pencil or King Kong climbing on a ruler.

This year's "Ideal Stationery" theme is "Stationery Film Industry." The design of the place and the activities are like a movie or a cinema. First, you see unpis's special area. He shared his creative process, saying that when he thinks of ideas, he often uses keywords or themes to connect thoughts, like making a movie script outline. For this show, he first thought about famous movie characters, scenes, or poses, then found fun ways to connect them with stationery.

Unpis once worked with a Japanese printing company called Sakaemark to create a "you are light" poster lamp. This small night light combines a poster with a lamp. When you turn on the light, faces appear, which was a fun design that became very popular on social media. It is also shown at the exhibition.

Following the "Stationery Film Industry" theme, Eslite Bookstore has planned many activities. For example, there's a "freshly cut eraser" station, like a food stand, where a Taiwanese company called "Prince Eraser" provides the erasers. There's also a "paper tape wall" where people can fill a hot dog box with paper tape.

Many stationery brands from Europe, America, Japan, and Korea are taking part in the exhibition. These include MOLESKINE, an Italian notebook brand over 100 years old that artists like Van Gogh and writers like Hemingway used. Also, KOKUYO, a famous Japanese notebook brand, is showing five different versions of its Campus notebook from 1975 until now. A Taiwanese exhibitor, "Letterpress Culture and Creativity," is also there with a Chandler foot-powered letterpress machine, letting people try letterpress printing.
