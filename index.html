            <h1>Chairman Xin Jie Missing for 24 Days, Vanke Says He Resigned for Personal Reasons</h1>
            <p>Xin Jie, the chairman of a large Chinese property company called Vanke Group, was reportedly taken away for investigation in September. He was missing for 24 days, which caused much talk. Today, Vanke Company announced that Mr. Xin Jie has given his resignation because of personal reasons. The company board has chosen Huang Liping to be the new chairman.</p>
            <p>According to Pengpai News, Vanke Company announced today that its board of directors received Mr. Xin Jie's written resignation on October 12. Mr. Xin Jie asked to leave his roles as a non-executive director and chairman of Vanke Company due to personal reasons. After leaving, he will not hold any positions at Vanke Company.</p>
            <p>Besides being the chairman of Vanke Group, Xin Jie was also the chairman and Party Secretary of Shenzhen Metro Group.

            <p>Many Chinese finance social media accounts and online messages said that Xin Jie was taken away on September 18 while attending a meeting in Shenzhen.

            <p>Taipei, October 13 (CNA) â€“ The stock market in the US fell a lot because China put limits on exporting rare earth minerals, and the US added a new 100% tax on Chinese goods. However, US President Trump announced that the US-China summit will still happen, which made US stock futures go up. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) shares fell below 1400 New Taiwan Dollars this morning. This made the Taiwan stock market drop by over 800 points, reaching a low of 26470.44 points. But then, the fall became smaller.</p>
            <p>At 9:15 AM, the Weighted Index was 26752.2 points, a big drop of 549.72 points. The total value of shares traded was 163.8 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Dollar Falls Below 30.6 Against US Dollar, Stock Market and Currency Both Drop</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 13 (CNA) â€“ During Taiwan's National Day holiday, China limited the export of rare earth minerals. In response, the United States announced it would greatly increase taxes on goods from China. Because of these bad economic news, both the stock market and the currency in Taiwan fell today. The Taiwan stock market dropped by 800 points at the start of trading. The New Taiwan Dollar also fell, going below 30.6 against the US Dollar.</p>
            <p>China put controls on rare earth exports, and US President Trump criticized Beijing for its unfriendly trade actions. He announced a new 100% tax on Chinese imports starting in November, which made the US stock market fall sharply on October 10.</p>
            <p>During the holiday, US stocks fell heavily. This caused many people to sell their shares. Today, the Taiwan stock market opened with a big drop of over 800 points. At the same time, the New Taiwan Dollar also fell. It opened at 30.57 this morning and quickly went below 30.6. It reached a low of 30.62, losing 7.5 cents. But the fall did not get worse.</p>
            <p>Bank experts said that people were worried about the US-China trade war getting more serious. This bad news could cause both the stock market and the currency in Taiwan to fall a lot. However, President Trump posted a message early in the morning saying that the US wants to help China, not harm it. His words seemed softer and helped calm the market's sad feelings. The financial market might correct itself, but it probably won't be too scared.</p>
