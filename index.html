            <h1>Modi Visits Japan, Says India and Japan Will Create an Asian Century</h1>
            <p>When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Tokyo, Japan today, he said that India and Japan will "create an Asian century." Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba promised to invest 10 trillion Japanese Yen (about 2 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) in India.</p>
            <p>News from AFP said that Modi spoke at a business meeting in Tokyo. He said, "The partnership between India and Japan is important and smart. It is based on economic reasons. We have changed our shared interests into shared success."</p>
            <p>"India is a starting point for Japanese companies to go into the Global South. We will create an Asian century that is stable, growing, and rich."</p>
            <p>Right now, the yearly trade between the two countries is more than 20 billion US dollars. Japan mostly sells more than it buys.</p>
            <p>Ishiba said, "Japan and India are important partners. We share values like freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. We have had a good friendship and trust for many years."</p>
            <p>"Our economic relationship is growing quickly. Japan's technology and India's smart people and big market help each other."</p>
            <p>Both Japan and India are having problems because of new taxes from US President Trump. Taxes on many Indian goods are now as high as 50%, starting this week.</p>
            <p>Japan's investments in India will focus on areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors. The two countries will also work together on important minerals. Both leaders plan to visit a chip factory tomorrow.</p>
            <p>They will also visit a factory that makes Shinkansen bullet trains. Their goal is to build a high-speed rail network in India that is 7,000 kilometers long by 2047, when India celebrates 100 years of independence, with help from Japan.</p>
            <p>After his trip to Japan, Modi plans to go to China. He will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit on August 31st and September 1st. Chinese President Xi Jinping will lead the meeting. Other leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, will also be there.</p>
            <p>This will be Modi's first visit to China since 2018.</p>

In the end, the Hawks won 10 to 5 against the Rakuten Monkeys, getting their 4th win in a row.</p>

Then Lin Cheng-hua hit another single that brought in 1 run. In the top of the 4th inning, after Chang Min-hsun hit a single, he moved to third base because of other plays and a wild pitch.

            <h1>Japan Will Deploy Long-Range Missiles Early, First Batch in Kumamoto to Watch China</h1>
            <p>Today, Japan's Ministry of Defense announced a plan to deploy improved versions of its "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missile." These missiles can strike back. The ground-launched version will start to be placed in Kumamoto this year. Japanese news reports say that Japan is worried China might attack Taiwan. So, Japan thinks it needs to make its defense stronger in the southwestern region.</p>
            <p>Japan is working hard to make the Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missile, used by its Ground Self-Defense Force, fly farther. Its current range is over 100 kilometers, but it will be extended to 1,000 kilometers. The development of the ground-launched version is almost finished. Tests are now being done to put these missiles on ships and fighter jets.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Defense announced today that the ground-launched missiles will first be placed at the Ground Self-Defense Force's Ken-gun base in Kumamoto City this year or next. In 2027, they will be placed at the Ground Self-Defense Force's Fuji base in Shizuoka Prefecture.</p>
            <p>The improved Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles, launched from ships or fighter jets, will be used earlier than planned, starting in 2027 instead of 2028.</p>
            <p>The improved ship-launched missiles will be put on the escort ship "Teruzuki," which is based in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture. The improved air-launched missiles will be put on the improved F-2 fighter jets that will be at the Air Self-Defense Force's Hyakuri base in Ibaraki Prefecture.</p>
            <p>To protect its distant islands, Japan is also developing a very fast gliding weapon called the "High-Speed Glide Bomb for Island Defense" (HVGP). It was planned to be deployed in 2026, but now it will be deployed this year at a training unit at the Fuji base in Shizuoka Prefecture. Also, in 2026, special units will be created to use this weapon at the Kamifurano base in Hokkaido and the Ebino base in Miyazaki Prefecture.</p>
            <p>The Sankei Shimbun newspaper reported that the Ministry of Defense announced the deployment in Kumamoto this year mainly because it is worried about a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. Japan believes it needs to make its defenses in the southwestern region stronger.</p>
            <p>Japanese Defense Minister Moto Nakatani said today at a press conference, "To protect our area, which is 3,000 kilometers from east to west and north to south, we must have the ability to stop and remove any attack, even if an area is invaded."</p>
            <p>This deployment of long-range missiles will be the first time Japan has "counter-attack capabilities" (the ability to attack enemy bases) since the Self-Defense Forces were created in 1954.</p>
            <p>The report also stated that besides the improved Type 12 missiles and the HVGP, the Ministry of Defense plans to get "Tomahawk" cruise missiles developed by the United States between 2025 and 2027.</p>
            <p>In December 2022, Japan approved new security documents, including a new "National Security Strategy." These documents state that Japan will have "counter-attack capabilities." This is a big change in Japan's defense policy since World War II. Japan's desire for "counter-attack capabilities" is seen as being aimed at China and North Korea.</p>
