            <h1>Turkey's First Lady Asks Melania Trump to Care for Children in Gaza</h1>
            <p>Today, Turkey's First Lady, Emine Erdogan, wrote a letter to the American First Lady, Melania Trump. She asked Melania to care for the children in Gaza, just as she cares for children in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reporters say that Emine asked Melania to write a letter to Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. She asked him to show kindness to the children in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, Melania attended a meeting between the US and Russia in Alaska. There, she wrote a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In her letter, she asked Putin to make peace for the sake of children.</p>
            <p>In her letter to Melania, Emine wrote: "I truly believe that your deep care for the 648 Ukrainian children who died in the war will also reach Gaza. In just two years, 62,000 innocent people in Gaza have been cruelly killed. This number includes 18,000 children."</p>
            <p>Emine also mentioned in her letter: "As a mother, a woman, and a person, I truly understand the feelings you expressed in your letter. I hope you can bring the same hope to the children in Gaza, who also want peace and quiet."</p>
            <p>Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has tried to help Russia and Ukraine find a solution during their war, which has been going on for four years.</p>
