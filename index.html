            <h1>Japan's Prime Minister Introduces "Indo-African Economic Zone Plan" to Compete with China</h1>
            <p>The 9th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9), organized by the Japanese government and the United Nations, started yesterday in Yokohama. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba presented a new economic idea called the "Indo-African Economic Zone Initiative" at the conference. China's influence in Africa is growing, so Japan wants to create a free and fair economic zone to help Africa grow.</p>
            <p>According to Jiji Press, TICAD9, which lasts for three days, opened yesterday afternoon in Yokohama. Ishiba presented the new economic idea, the "Indo-African Economic Zone Initiative."</p>
            <p>Ishiba talked about the historical connections within this economic zone. He said, "This economic area has many young people and a lot of energy resources. It is becoming more important as a place for high economic growth." He said he hopes to help Africa grow by making connections stronger and creating a free and fair economic zone.</p>
            <p>He also said that he will talk about the "Indo-African Economic Zone Initiative" with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will visit at the end of the month.</p>
            <p>The report said that Ishiba's "Indo-African Economic Zone Initiative" is part of Japan's plan for a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific." It includes using Official Development Assistance (ODA) well and matching Japanese companies with companies from other countries. It also aims to deal with the high tariffs set by US President Donald Trump's government.</p>
            <p>The Asahi Shimbun reported that the "Indo-African Economic Zone Initiative" wants to make economic connections stronger between India, Indian Ocean island countries, and Africa. More Japanese businesses are exporting to Africa from their bases in India or China. This means they can work more closely with companies from other countries to increase investment in Africa.</p>
            <p>Ishiba also said that Japan will give Official Development Assistance (ODA) to improve the "Nacala Corridor." This corridor connects copper mining countries in inland Africa to the east coast. Also, Japan will make connections better both inside and outside Africa to make sure there is a strong supply of mineral resources.</p>
            <p>Ishiba spoke about his visit to Senegal 25 years ago and his talks with students there. He said, "The key to Africa becoming a center for growth is to improve the skills of young people and women and to create job opportunities."</p>
            <p>Ishiba hopes to train 30,000 people in artificial intelligence (AI) in three years. For GAVI, an international group that helps get vaccines to developing countries, Japan will give up to 550 million US dollars (about 16.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars) over the next five years.</p>
            <p>Also, Japan is working with the African Development Bank (AfDB). They are thinking about making their support stronger for private businesses, providing up to 5.5 billion US dollars in financial help.</p>
            <p>The report said that in previous years, the Japanese government would announce a goal for the total amount of money invested by both government and private companies. However, they will not announce a goal this time. At the last TICAD8 in 2022, then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that 30 billion US dollars would be invested by both government and private companies over the next three years.</p>
            <p>TICAD9 has Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba as co-chair. Former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is the acting chair. Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya also attended. Other people present included representatives from 49 countries, with 33 leaders from Africa, and also international groups, companies, lawmakers, and people from civil society. The main idea of TICAD9 is "Finding Solutions to Problems Together."</p>
            <p>TICAD is an international meeting that the Japanese government started in 1993. It happens every three years. Ishiba said in his speech yesterday, "Since TICAD started in 1993, Japan has always believed that Africa has a good future, and Africa is a trustworthy partner."</p>

            <h1>India Successfully Tests "Agni-5" Nuclear Missile, Reaching All of China</h1>
            <p>India announced today that it has successfully tested a medium-range missile. If this missile is used, it can carry nuclear warheads that can reach all parts of China.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, the "Agni-5" missile was successfully tested in Odisha, eastern India. Officials said the missile "proved all its operational and technical features."</p>
            <p>The "Agni-5" missile is one of several medium and short-range missiles that India has made on its own. It is meant to make India's defense stronger against Pakistan and China.</p>
            <p>India and China, the two most populated countries in the world, are strongly competing for power in South Asia. Their relationship became much worse after a deadly fight at their border in 2020.</p>
            <p>India is also a member of the "Quad" security group, which is seen as a way to balance China's power. The other members are the United States, Australia, and Japan.</p>
            <p>Pakistan, India's old enemy, also has nuclear weapons. In May this year, armed groups attacked the Kashmir area, which India controls, and 26 people died. India blamed the government in Islamabad, but Pakistan said it was not involved. At that time, the two countries almost went to war.</p>
            <p>However, both India and China are now trying to fix their relationship. This is because of global trade and political problems caused by US President Trump's tariff war.</p>
            <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in five years at a meeting in Russia last October.</p>
            <p>Modi is expected to visit China later this month to attend the "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation" summit, which is a regional security group. This will be his first visit to China since 2018.</p>
            <p>Relations between New Delhi and Washington became tense because President Trump gave India a final warning. He told India to stop buying oil from Russia. Russia is attacking Ukraine, and oil is a very important source of money for Russia.</p>
            <p>The United States said that if India does not change where it buys its oil, the US will double its current 25% tax on India to 50% by August 27.</p>
