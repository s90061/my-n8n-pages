People in the United States felt a bit less positive about the economy in May. A recent survey showed that their confidence went down slightly. The main reason for this drop was that many households are still worried about rising prices, especially for things like food and gasoline.

The survey also found that people are less hopeful about the future. They are not as sure about how the economy will perform or if there will be enough jobs. When people feel less confident, they often choose to spend less money. If this continues, it could cause the economy to grow more slowly in the coming months.

**AI Job Openings Are Growing, But Skills Are Missing**

Job advertisements asking for Artificial Intelligence (AI) skills are increasing, but they still make up only a small part of all job openings. This is according to a new report. Even though more companies are looking for AI talent, many find it difficult to hire suitable candidates. The main problem is that job seekers often do not have the specific skills needed for these new AI roles.

This situation suggests that AI might not be changing the job market as quickly as some people expected. While AI is becoming more important, the lack of trained workers means that its full impact on jobs might take more time. It also shows there is a clear need for people to learn new skills to match what employers are looking for in the fast-changing world of technology.

**Are Popular European Cities Too Crowded for Tourists?**

Many popular European cities, such as Venice, Amsterdam, and Barcelona, are dealing with a problem called "overtourism." This means that too many tourists are visiting, which can cause difficulties for the people who live there. The large number of visitors puts pressure on local resources, raises prices, and can harm the environment and the unique culture of these places.

As the summer travel season approaches, travelers are starting to wonder if these famous cities are still the best places to visit. Local residents in these areas have become vocal about their unhappiness, complaining about the crowds and the impact on their daily lives. This situation highlights the growing need for more careful and responsible tourism, where cities and visitors work together to protect these beautiful destinations for everyone.
