            <h1>Zhubei Air Smells Like Burning Plastic; Environmental Bureau Investigating Possible Leak</h1>
            <p>The Hsinchu County Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) announced tonight that there is a smell of burning plastic in the air in many parts of Zhubei City. They first thought it was not open burning. It seems more likely that a strange-smelling substance has leaked out. The EPB will continue to search for where the pollution is coming from.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu County EPB said in a statement that they have checked many areas. These include different sections of Guangming 6th Road, Zhuangjing North and South Roads, Jiafeng North and South Roads, the area around the High-Speed Rail Station, different sections of Dongxing Road, and Shixing Road. They have not found any clear source of the pollution yet.</p>
            <p>The EPB explained that they looked at the results from their sensors. The sensor data first showed that it was not like open burning. It looked more like a leak of a strange substance. However, the sensors did not show clear changes over time and in different places. This means they cannot use the sensor results to find the source of the pollution. They will continue to investigate.</p>
