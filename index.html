[Original News URL: https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240423-the-rise-of-the-phygital-store-where-online-meets-offline-shopping]

Shopping is changing. Stores are now mixing online and in-person experiences, a trend called "phygital." This means you can use your phone to help you shop in a physical store. For example, some shops let you scan a QR code to see more product information online, or use virtual reality to try on clothes without actually putting them on. This new way of shopping makes things easier and more interesting for customers. Companies are doing this because they want to offer a better experience. They also learn more about what customers like by seeing how they use both online and offline tools. Experts say this mix of digital and physical shopping is the future, making retail a more modern and personal experience.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing jobs and workplaces. Many people think AI will affect work in the future, but it is already happening now. AI tools can help workers by taking over simple, repeated tasks. For example, AI can write basic emails, analyze large amounts of data, or organize schedules. This allows people to focus on more creative and important work. While some jobs might change, experts believe AI will not cause mass job losses. Instead, it will create new kinds of jobs and require new skills from workers. Companies and individuals need to learn about AI and adapt to these changes to succeed in the modern job market.

Paris is working hard to become a more bike-friendly city, especially for the upcoming Olympic Games. The city hopes many visitors and residents will choose bicycles instead of cars to move around. To achieve this, Paris has built many new bike lanes, making cycling safer and easier. There are also more bike rental services available. However, making Paris a city of bikes is not easy. There are still many cars, and some streets can be crowded and noisy. Safety for cyclists remains a concern for some people. Despite these challenges, Paris continues to push for a greener city where cycling is a main way to travel, not just for the Olympics but for the future.`;
