            <h1>Taiwan's Taekwondo Team Wins Silver at Universiade; China Tries to Take Congratulatory Message</h1>
            <p>Two people from China tried to take a congratulatory message from a Taiwanese athlete today at the Universiade in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany. Both the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) have spoken out against China's rude actions.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's taekwondo team won a silver medal today at the World University Games in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany. But after they won, two Chinese people tried to take the congratulatory message from Taiwan's Minister of Education from the athletes. They also had an argument with Taiwanese media.</p>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said in a statement that when Taiwanese athletes compete abroad, China uses harsh, aggressive, and uncivilized methods. They not only stopped the congratulatory message but also caused other problems.</p>
            <p>The DPP added that it is very normal and right for a government to congratulate its athletes when they win medals. All people in Taiwan should come together and cheer for Taiwan's athletes. All Taiwanese people see China's actions, and these actions should be criticized. Such behavior is not civilized and should not happen.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) also strongly criticized this behavior today. They said it was wild and showed no sportsmanship. They also said it would not help relations between Taiwan and China.</p>
            <p>The TPP said that Taiwan's male taekwondo team won a silver medal at the Universiade in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany, which is something Taiwan can be proud of. Athletes represent their country in international sports and bring honor to their nation. However, China tried to stop them in a rude way and take the congratulatory message from the Taiwanese athletes. This has spoiled the simple exchange of sports.</p>
            <p>The TPP also said they appreciate the sports officials who bravely defended the athletes and Taiwan's honor. They also asked China to stop such actions right away and not to use politics to stop Taiwanese athletes from performing well in international competitions.</p>

            <h1>Thailand to Expel Cambodian Ambassador, Says Cambodia Planted New Landmines That Injured Soldier</h1>
            <p>Thailand's acting Prime Minister, Phumtham, has accused Cambodia of planting new landmines in a disputed border area. This caused a Thai soldier to get hurt. The ruling Pheu Thai Party said that Thailand has called back its ambassador from Cambodia and will send Cambodia's ambassador away.</p>
            <p>Channel NewsAsia from Singapore reported that the Pheu Thai Party stated on social media that Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally protested to Cambodia. They said that the landmines found in the area were new and had not been there during earlier patrols. They also said that Thailand has lowered its diplomatic relations with Cambodia.</p>
            <p>The Cambodian government did not reply immediately to requests for comments.</p>
            <p>Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that they had not yet heard about the decision to call back the Thai special envoy or the plan to expel Cambodia's ambassador.</p>
            <p>According to the Pheu Thai Party's Facebook post, acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said that Thailand has lowered its diplomatic relations with Cambodia. He also said that Thailand will look more closely at the relations between the two countries.</p>
            <p>The Pheu Thai Party added that the government has ordered all border checkpoints in its area to close. This will strictly limit people from entering the country.</p>
            <p>The Pheu Thai Party said that yesterday's landmine incident injured the Thai soldier, and he lost his right leg. On July 20, the Thai government already criticized Cambodia for possibly planting landmines that hurt people along the border between the two countries.</p>
            <p>The former leaders of the two countries also had a disagreement. Former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said he did not want to talk with former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</p>
            <p>On July 20, Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that these landmines seriously go against international law and attack Thailand's right to govern itself.</p>
            <p>The Nation newspaper in Thailand reported that on July 16, an explosion happened near the Chong Bok border area in Ubon Ratchathani province. This hurt three Thai soldiers.</p>
            <p>The Nation also said that after Thai officials checked, they found that the landmines involved in this event were newly placed. They were not part of Thailand's weapons or storage.</p>
            <p>Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they did not plant new landmines. On the evening of July 21, they said in a statement that the Thai soldiers had gone off their agreed patrol route inside Cambodia. They had entered an area that had unexploded landmines.</p>
            <p>Cambodian and Thai soldiers fought on May 28 near the Mom Bei area. One Cambodian soldier died. Since then, Thailand and Cambodia have been in a military and diplomatic problem. They have sent more soldiers along the land border and have put in place travel restrictions against each other.</p>

            <h1>Former Taoyuan City Councilor Wu Tsung-hsien Accused of Stealing Millions in Assistant Fees; Prosecutors Ask to Detain Him</h1>
            <p>Former Taoyuan City Councilor Wu Tsung-hsien, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, is accused of illegally taking tens of millions of New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) in assistant fees. On July 22, the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office searched many places. Yesterday, they brought in Wu Tsung-hsien and his assistant, Fan-Jiang, and asked the court to detain them without letting them see anyone. The court decided that Assistant Fan-Jiang could be released on bail for NTD 300,000, while Wu Tsung-hsien's case is still being reviewed by the court.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office said today that Wu Tsung-hsien and his assistant, Fan-Jiang, are suspected of falsely claiming assistant fees while Wu Tsung-hsien was a Taoyuan City Councilor. This happened from January 2011 to January 2019, and they stole nearly NTD 10 million.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutors Office stated that starting from July 22, for several days, they directed the Taipei City Investigation Office of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau to search 11 locations. They also asked 10 people, including Wu Tsung-hsien, to come in for questioning. After questioning by the prosecutor, it was believed that all 10 people, including Wu Tsung-hsien, were involved in crimes like public officials using their positions to steal money, under the Anti-Corruption Act.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutors Office said that Wu Tsung-hsien and Assistant Fan-Jiang are highly suspected of committing crimes. There is a risk that they might run away or talk to other people involved in the crime. So, the Prosecutors Office asked the Taoyuan District Court yesterday and early this morning to detain them without letting them see anyone. For the other people accused, except for another person named Wu who the prosecutor told to go home, everyone else was released on bail, ranging from NTD 30,000 to NTD 100,000.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutors Office said that after the court looked at Assistant Fan-Jiang's case, it found that he was strongly suspected of a crime and there was a reason to detain him. However, because all the other evidence that is not from spoken statements is complete, the court decided that detention was not needed. So, he was released on bail for NTD 300,000. Wu Tsung-hsien's case is still being decided by the court.</p>
