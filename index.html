            <h1>Aerospace Demand Rises After Pandemic: Taiwanese Companies Join Global Supply Chain</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 14 (CNA) â€“ After the pandemic, the world's aviation market is very busy. This has made the market for aerospace repair and parts much bigger, creating many business chances. Because global aerospace supply chains are still not fully recovered after the pandemic, Taiwanese companies have a great chance to join international supply chains. Leaders in the industry say that Taiwan already has an important role and will keep working to be more influential in the global aerospace market.</p>
            <p>The Taipei International Aerospace and Defense Industry Exhibition will start on September 18. After the pandemic, there is strong demand in the world's airline market. Delays in getting new airplanes and older planes needing more repairs have increased the need for repairs and parts. Taiwan's aerospace industry is getting a lot of attention. From repairs and manufacturing to supplying parts, Taiwan is slowly becoming a strong player in the global market.</p>
            <p>As the pandemic rules ended, the need for passenger and cargo flights quickly bounced back. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts that in 2025, the global airline industry's income will be more than one trillion US dollars for the first time, an increase of 4.4% to 1.07 trillion US dollars. The number of passengers will reach a new high of 5.2 billion.</p>
            <p>However, problems with the supply chain and a lack of workers that built up during the pandemic are still not solved. Airplane makers Boeing and Airbus continue to get more orders, but they are still late in delivering planes. The average age of planes currently in use around the world remains high.</p>
            <p>Experts guess that in 2025 and 2026, Boeing and Airbus will deliver 23% and 26% more planes, reaching 1,367 and 1,722 planes respectively. As the number of planes in the world grows, the market for aerospace repairs (MRO) and parts will also keep growing, creating many business opportunities.</p>
            <p>Besides the market getting better, government policies and changes in supply chains are also helping. Governments in different countries are starting projects to build their own airplanes. This increases local demand and helps the aerospace industry grow in their own countries. At the same time, global supply chains are changing, and some orders are moving to Taiwan. This gives local companies new chances to grow.</p>
            <p>As new opportunities appear in the global market, Taiwanese companies are actively trying to get a share. In May this year, Evergreen Aviation Technologies (EGAT) announced a partnership agreement with Airbus. EGAT will become a Tier 1 supplier for airframe components, starting a direct working relationship.</p>
            <p>EGAT was already an important partner for Boeing and GE Aviation engines. Now, with Airbus also included, it means their manufacturing skills and how much they can use their factories will greatly improve. Hsieh Hsin-wen, the general manager of EGAT, said he hopes this will help Taiwan's aerospace industry work together and grow, making Taiwan more influential in the global aerospace market.</p>
            <p>EGAT is also one of the top ten professional repair companies in the world. It has certifications from many national aviation authorities, attracting repair orders from all over the world. Especially for large commercial aircraft (B747/A380/A340), EGAT repairs more planes than most other companies globally. This shows how strong it is in the international market.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that as Boeing and Airbus deliver more planes each year, EGAT's repair capacity for this year is almost fully booked. After their new repair hangar at Taoyuan Airport starts working, its capacity will increase by more than 70% compared to this year.</p>
            <p>Another important Taiwanese company, AIDC (Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation), is driven by both military and civilian markets. AIDC stated that in the first quarter of this year, it received new orders worth NT$8.5 billion. In the first half of the year, total orders for civilian aircraft and engines were over NT$10 billion. Its customers include big international aerospace companies like Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Rolls-Royce, and GE.</p>
            <p>Market news says that AIDC might take on a bigger role in supplying parts for civil aircraft systems this year. Talks are in their final stages. A high-level official even said directly, "Taiwan already has an important place in the international aviation supply chain."</p>
            <p>Asia Pacific Airlines (APEX) has experience repairing both military and civilian aircraft. This year, the number of civilian aircraft it repairs is expected to increase. It is also actively taking on military aircraft repair jobs, so its business outlook is stable.</p>
            <p>Besides large repair and manufacturing companies, many Taiwanese companies that specialize in supplying parts also play a key role in the international aerospace industry. TUC (TUC Technology Inc.), a copper clad laminate manufacturer, is actively working in the defense and aerospace fields. Its Teflon materials have been approved by major European and American companies and are now being mass-produced. They are used in radar and aerospace equipment, and future revenues are expected to grow.</p>
            <p>JPP-KY, a supplier of mechanical parts, successfully joined the Dassault military aircraft supply chain as a Tier-1 supplier by buying the French company Segnere. It also supplies mechanical parts to Airbus for a long time, increasing its influence in the European military and aerospace industries.</p>
            <p>Sheng Tung Precision Industrial Co., Ltd., an aerospace parts manufacturer, continues to supply Boeing and Airbus. It also works closely with AIDC. This year, aerospace business is expected to make up almost 70% of its revenue, showing that its income structure is moving more towards aerospace.</p>
            <p>Pao I Industrial Co., Ltd. focuses on precise metal processing. Its products include assembled parts, cooling fins, and turbine engine parts. It has advanced skills in processing superalloys and special manufacturing methods, which has helped it secure a place in the global aerospace supply chain.</p>
            <p>Industry insiders say that Taiwan has excellent CNC machining and precise metal manufacturing skills. This means it can meet the high accuracy needs for aerospace parts worldwide. As airlines globally expand their fleets, the need for repairs and parts will keep growing. Taiwanese companies will strengthen their partnerships with big international companies and keep their share in the global market.</p>

            <h1>Joseph Wu Visits Wistron and Other Companies in the Czech Republic, Hopes Technology Taiwan Becomes Europe's Best Partner</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 14 (CNA) â€“ Foreign Minister Joseph Wu shared on Facebook that during his visit to the Czech Republic, he visited the "Advanced Chip Design and Research Center" (ACDRC), which is a cooperation project between Taiwan and the Czech Republic. He also visited Taiwanese technology companies Inventec and Wistron. He hopes that Taiwan's "New Top Ten AI Development Projects" can connect with the Czech Republic, creating more cooperation areas beyond semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu started his trip to Europe, with the Czech Republic as his first stop. Today, he posted on Facebook that "From Tech to Culture" is the main idea for this year's "European Taiwan Culture Year." After opening a special exhibition at the National Palace Museum, he went to Brno. There, he visited the "Advanced Chip Design and Research Center" (ACDRC), a joint project between Taiwan and the Czech Republic. He also visited Taiwanese tech companies Inventec and Wistron. He learned a lot about the chances and challenges for cooperation between the two countries in technology.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu explained that Brno is only a two-hour drive from the capital, Prague. It has about 400,000 people, but also 60,000 university students, making it a true "university city." This young energy helps technology innovation, providing a good environment for Taiwan's semiconductor design and technology industries.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu pointed out that Brno University of Technology is where the important Taiwan-Czech cooperation project, ACDRC, is located. At a time when the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland might form a "European chip triangle," Taiwan is sharing its experience. It is helping the Czech Republic train excellent professionals, increasing Taiwan's influence in the semiconductor industry. At the same time, it is making both economies and democracies stronger.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu also thanked Professor Radek HolÃ½, the Vice-Rector and ACDRC project director, and his team for their warm welcome. They showed him around the wafer design classroom and semiconductor lab, where he learned about the project's achievements. Joseph Wu said that both sides are interested in working together on AI technology. He hopes Taiwan's "New Top Ten AI Development Projects" can connect with the Czech Republic, expanding cooperation beyond semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu then visited Inventec and Wistron. Both Taiwanese companies said that the Czech Republic is in the "heart of Europe." It has good transport links and talented people. These were key reasons why they invested and set up businesses there around 2006. Now, they have created over 1,200 jobs in the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu mentioned that Inventec is expanding its production in the Czech Republic for the car electronics industry, and a new factory will open soon. Wistron won the Pluxee "Best Employer Award" and also received the "Major Investment Achievement Award" from the Czech Association for Foreign Investment (AFI).</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Hon Hai (Foxconn) employs 5,000 people in the Czech Republic. For many years, it has been one of the top three exporting companies in the Czech Republic. This shows that the Czech Republic widely recognizes the contributions of Taiwan's technology industry.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu emphasized that technology and culture are like two wheels of a carriage, both moving Taiwan-Europe relations forward. This is a practical example of "economic diplomacy" and "values diplomacy." At a crucial time when global supply chains are changing and building "non-red supply chains," Taiwan hopes to work with Europe to seize this historical chance for prosperity. Taiwan hopes that "Trusted Technology Taiwan" (3T) can become Europe's best partner in global competition.</p>
