            <h1>Lai Ching-te: Central Government Fully Supports Hualien County to Quickly Rescue Stranded People</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te, who is also the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, said today that a dammed lake in Matai'an Stream in Hualien has overflowed. The central government had warned about this many times. It also worked with the Hualien County government to move many people to safety early. The central government will fully support the Hualien County government to quickly rescue people who are stuck and start cleaning up and rebuilding.</p>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party held a regular meeting this afternoon. Lai Ching-te said that strong Typhoon Kabasawa had come in the past few days. He thanked all the people working to prevent and fix disasters, including soldiers, and those who keep important services like water, electricity, and the internet working. They were ready to help at all times.</p>
            <p>Lai Ching-te said that for the overflowing dammed lake in Matai'an Stream in Hualien, the central government had given many warnings. They worked with the Hualien County government to move many people to safety early. The central government will fully support the Hualien County government to quickly rescue people who are stuck and start cleaning up and rebuilding.</p>
            <p>Lai Ching-te said he thanked the party's central office, led by Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung. They worked with local party officials in Hualien to help with disaster relief. They found out what the local people needed after the disaster and offered help, like collecting supplies. If needed, they also formed volunteer groups to help clean homes and support people to get back to normal life quickly.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng, a spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party, said after the meeting that the party, following Lai Ching-te's instructions, had started different ways to help with disaster relief. This included Hsu Kuo-yung announcing that he would donate NT$100,000 to help with relief efforts.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng said that right now, the central party office has sent a small team to Hualien. This team is led by Zhang Zhi-hao, the director of the organization department. They are looking for a good place in Hualien to house people affected by the disaster and to receive supplies from different places. They aim to find a place by this evening.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng said that the central party office is also working with local city and county party offices. They plan to form volunteer teams from different party offices, similar to how they helped with disaster relief in Tainan. These teams can provide people and things to help Hualien residents get back to normal life quickly.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked, Kuomintang Chairman Eric Chu said he would donate NT$1 million from the Kuomintang to help with disaster relief. Wu Zheng said this was a very good thing. He hoped to see everyone in Taiwan, no matter their party, help the people of Hualien together.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng said that the members of the central standing committee were very concerned about how to help Hualien. Ruan Zhao-xiong, the deputy secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, also attended the meeting. He explained that the Executive Yuan has set up an emergency center at Hualien Guangfu Sugar Factory. Supplies will be collected and sent to this center.</p>
            <p>It was mentioned that Chung Chia-pin, the head of the Democratic Progressive Party's group in the Legislative Yuan, said at the meeting that the group's main focus is on disaster relief right now. Also, the meeting that was planned for today for selecting candidates was canceled, and local party meetings were also stopped for now.</p>

            <h1>Polaris Research: TSMC's Growth in Next Two Years Will Help Taiwan Stock Market</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market has been reaching new high points lately. Fan Zhen-hong, the general manager of Polaris Research, believes this is because TSMC's business will definitely grow in the next two years. TSMC makes up 40% of the Taiwan stock market's value. While the stock market's value is high now, and there might be some small ups and downs because it has gone up so much, it will not fall too much. This is because TSMC is strong, the future looks clear, and the US lowering interest rates will also help.</p>
            <p>Polaris Financial Group held a meeting today to talk about what they expect for investments in the fourth quarter. Fan Zhen-hong said that orders for advanced chips, smaller than 5 nanometers, are decided one or two years in advance. So, it is possible to mostly know what TSMC's business will be like in the next two years, and the company is expected to grow.</p>
            <p>Fan Zhen-hong thinks that the Taiwan stock market's value is currently high, more than its average over the last 10 years. Also, since a big drop in early April, the market has gone up a lot. So, it is normal for there to be some small ups and downs in the short term. But because TSMC is strong and the future is clear, with the help of the US lowering interest rates, the market is not expected to fall too much.</p>
            <p>Polaris Research looked at the plans of 5 big cloud service companies in the US, like Microsoft, Meta, Google, AWS, and Oracle. They expect that in 2025, these companies will spend a total of 359 billion US dollars. This is more than 50% more than last year's 229 billion US dollars. They also expect it to grow to 446 billion US dollars in 2026. This shows that investments in AI will continue.</p>
            <p>Fan Zhen-hong explained that the Taiwan stock market is becoming more focused on a few big companies. TSMC alone makes up more than 40% of the market's value. Among the top 5 companies by market value, if we don't count Fubon Financial Holdings which is number 5, the first fourâ€”TSMC, Hon Hai, Delta Electronics, and MediaTekâ€”are all connected to AI. If we add the long list of companies that work with TSMC in making chips, and other companies that make things for AI like cooling systems and power supplies, then companies related to AI make up more than 60% of the Taiwan stock market. Because the AI trend is not stopping, the Taiwan stock market is still expected to do well.</p>
            <p>Polaris expects that the Taiwan stock market index will move between 24000 and 27000 points in the fourth quarter, staying at a high level.</p>

            <h1>Defense Budget Reaches New High; AIDC: Focus on Military Aircraft Repair, Drone Business</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's defense budget for next year will be nearly NT$620 billion. AIDC (Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation) said they are ready. They are working with big US military aircraft companies to make military repair services better. They will focus on repairing many types of military aircraft, like the Army's AH-1W helicopters and the Air Force's F-16 fighter jets. They also plan to grow their business with drones and with civil aviation and technology services. This will help the company earn more money.</p>
            <p>AIDC held an online meeting for investors today. Vice President Chin Huai-sheng, Finance Director Huang Hsiu-yen, and Corporate Development Director Ma Ping-chun led the meeting.</p>
            <p>According to AIDC's latest financial report, in the second quarter of 2025, the company made about NT$8.1 billion in sales and lost NT$0.24 per share. In the first half of the year, sales were NT$15.68 billion, and they earned NT$0.01 per share. Their profits were lower than last year because of fines for delays in delivering advanced trainer jets and a big drop in the US dollar exchange rate.</p>
            <p>AIDC said they are working hard to deliver the advanced trainer jets on time. They are also developing their drone business and growing their civil aviation and technology services. This will continue to help the company grow.</p>
            <p>For defense, AIDC said they are making their drone business bigger. They recently showed a "drone defense system." This system combines different ways to stop drones and can greatly help national security, public life, and privacy. Also, they are helping Thunder Tiger Technology develop bigger drone helicopters and planning to make them themselves. Importantly, at the Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition, AIDC worked with an American company. Their very accurate visual positioning technology is expected to bring big changes to Taiwan's drone industry.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense recently started asking for bids for military drones that are also suitable for civilian use. This business could be worth up to NT$50 billion, making it Taiwan's largest drone buying plan ever. AIDC said that as a part of the Taiwan Excellent Drone International Business Opportunities Alliance (TEDIBOA), they always help other members improve. AIDC is good at combining different systems and making high-quality products in large numbers. They can help small and medium-sized businesses in Taiwan with both development and production.</p>
            <p>For civil aviation business, AIDC said that more people are traveling by air around the world. The basic situation for passenger planes and aircraft engines is stable, and the future looks good. AIDC uses its machines and production ability to make airplane bodies, parts, engine cases, and other parts. They are popular with international partners and have long-term, stable orders from big companies in Europe, America, and Japan. They are already fulfilling these orders.</p>
            <p>AIDC is also using its aviation skills to develop "technology services," which are now being used. AIDC said they developed their own "Power Island" energy storage system. They first installed it at their own factory. When there is a power outage, it can supply electricity to the entire factory for 6 hours. This shows that their Power Island system is reliable.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan has approved next year's defense budget, which will be a new high. Including special budgets, the total will be nearly NT$620 billion. AIDC said they are ready. At the Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition, they worked with big US military aircraft companies to make military repair services better. They will focus on repairing many types of military aircraft, like the Army's AH-1W helicopters and the Air Force's F-16 fighter jets. This will fully meet the needs of all three armed forces.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, AIDC said they will continue to follow government policies, expand their international market, improve their business strength, and focus on long-term growth. They were recently chosen for the "2025 Foreign Investor's Top 100 Taiwanese Companies" list. This is the first time AIDC has been on this list, which means foreign investors see a good future for the defense industry.</p>
