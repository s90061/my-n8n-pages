        <h2>Trump: Deadline for Reciprocal Tariffs Will Not Be Extended</h2>
        <p>US President Donald Trump said today that the 90-day pause for reciprocal tariffs will not be extended past July 9. Trump explained that after this deadline, unless countries have a special agreement with the United States, Washington will start applying extra taxes on their goods.</p>
        <p>He said that letters about these new tariffs will be sent "very soon." Trump also mentioned that the US will decide the tariff amount based on how countries treat the US. Some countries might face high tariffs, like 25%, 35%, or even 50%.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Trump had played down the July 9 deadline. He noted that it's hard to make agreements with every single country in the world. He said talks are still happening, but it's not possible to talk with all 200 countries.</p>

        <h2>US Media: NBA Player Malik Beasley Investigated for Gambling Scandal, Pistons Contract Talks Stop</h2>
        <p>ESPN, a sports channel, reported today that Malik Beasley, a basketball player for the Detroit Pistons, is being investigated by federal lawyers. This is because he is suspected of betting on NBA games and special parts of games (called 'prop bets').</p>
        <p>The accusations are about things that happened when Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2023-24 season. Beasley's lawyer, Steve Haney, told ESPN that being investigated doesn't mean he has been charged with a crime. He added that Beasley is innocent until proven guilty, and so far, he has not been charged.</p>
        <p>Beasley is 28 years old and has played in the NBA for nine seasons. He was going to sign a new contract with the Pistons for three years and 42 million US dollars. However, because of the investigation, these contract talks have now stopped.</p>

        <h2>Kyodo News: China Plans to Invite Trump to September 3 Tiananmen Square Parade in Beijing</h2>
        <p>Japan's Kyodo News reported today that China plans to invite former US President Donald Trump to a big event on September 3. This event will be in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to celebrate 80 years since World War II ended. There will also be a military parade.</p>
        <p>Sources say this invitation comes around the time of the United Nations meeting in New York. The US had suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping visit the US in September. If either of these visits happens, it would be the first time the leaders of the world's two biggest economies meet face-to-face during Trump's second time in office.</p>
        <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is also expected to attend the parade in Beijing. If leaders from China, Russia, and the US all celebrate the war's end together, it could create difficulties for Japan in its international relations.</p>
        <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that on June 5, Xi Jinping invited Trump to visit China again during a phone call, and Trump thanked him. Trump, who visited China in 2017, also invited Xi to visit the United States. However, some US officials, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, might not want Trump to go to the parade. China is also careful about Xi visiting the US, as they don't want a difficult meeting like the one between Ukraine's President Zelenskyy and Trump in February. China might send Premier Li Qiang to the UN meeting instead.</p>
