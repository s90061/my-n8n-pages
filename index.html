            <h1>US Congress Report: US-Taiwan Low-Key Military Cooperation Appears to be Expanding</h1>
            <p>A US Congress research report from late July looked at military aid to Taiwan in recent years. The report said that security cooperation between the US and Taiwan, including training in both countries, seems to be growing, even though most of it is not public. Since 2023, Taiwan has been part of the US "International Military Education and Training" (IMET) program to make their armies work better together.</p>
            <p>According to this report, "Taiwan: Defense and Military Issues," US military sales to Taiwan have always been the clearest way the US helps Taiwan's defense. Most of these sales happen through the "Foreign Military Sales" (FMS) system.</p>
            <p>From 2015 to 2025, the US government told Congress that it sold more than 28 billion US dollars (about 837.2 billion New Taiwan dollars) in military goods to Taiwan through FMS.</p>
            <p>The report also stated that besides the FMS program, the 117th Congress (from January 2021 to January 2023) passed the "Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act." This law allows new ways to provide military aid to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>For the first time, the "Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act" gave the "Presidential Drawdown Authority" (PDA) to Taiwan. This means the US Department of Defense can directly give defense items and services to Taiwan from its own stock. This was done because Congress was worried that FMS deliveries took too long.</p>
            <p>The Congressional Research Service said that since the "Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act" started, the government has announced three PDA plans for Taiwan, totaling 1.5 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>This law also, for the first time, gave "Foreign Military Financing" (FMF) to Taiwan. This money can be used as loans or grants to buy US weapons. After this, Congress also approved money to give military aid to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Regarding US-Taiwan security cooperation, the report said it seems to be growing. It mentioned Taiwan's involvement in the "International Military Education and Training" (IMET) program. The US government started IMET with Taiwan based on the 2023 fiscal year budget law. This aims to make the two militaries work better together and improve their ability to act jointly.</p>
            <p>There is not much public information about Taiwan's involvement in IMET. In 2023, Mira Resnick, who was then a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the US Department of State, told Congress that Taiwan's participation in IMET allows it to get big discounts on all training programs within the US Department of Defense.</p>
            <p>"We believe that providing IMET will save Taiwan millions of US dollars each year. This money can then be used again and put back into Taiwan's defense budget."</p>
            <p>Thomas Shattuck, an American scholar who has studied Taiwan and cross-strait issues for a long time, wrote last year on the website of the Global Taiwan Institute (GTI) in Washington that the IMET program lets Taiwanese military officers train in the US with other international partners.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has started many steps to improve its military readiness and has increased its defense budget. The US Congressional Research Service estimates that from 2019 to 2023, Taiwan's defense budget grew by almost 5% each year on average. In 2024, Taiwan spent about 2.5% of its total economic output (GDP) on defense. Taiwan's president also said that they plan to increase military spending to more than 3% of GDP this year.</p>
            <p>The report pointed out that Taiwan faces problems at home when trying to reach its defense goals. Those who make policies do not all agree on the best way to stop China from using force. While both main political parties in Taiwan say they support more money for defense, the fight over the budget this year between the government and the parliament, which is controlled by the opposition, has made some people worried if Taiwan can get enough money for defense.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwan's military has trouble finding, training, and keeping people. Some observers think that civilian defense is not ready enough. Also, energy, food, water, communication, and other important systems can be easily damaged from outside.</p>
            <p>"For the people, it is not clear yet what costs Taiwanese people are willing or able to pay in terms of economic safety, personal safety, and lives if there is a war across the Taiwan Strait."</p>

            <h1>Brazil's President Denies Provoking US, Continues to Seek Non-Dollar Trade Options</h1>
            <p>On July 30, US President Trump announced a 50% import tax on about 36% of goods from Brazil. Brazil's President Lula said yesterday that Brazil will not stop looking for other ways to trade with other countries using currencies other than the US dollar.</p>
            <p>Brazil's news agency, AgÃªncia Brasil, reported that Lula spoke about the US taxes yesterday at a Workers' Party meeting in Brazil's capital, BrasÃ­lia. He said Brazil needs a different currency for trading with other countries, so Brazil doesn't have to depend on the US dollar.</p>
            <p>The US did not directly say that replacing the US dollar in global trade was why they taxed Brazil. But experts say that this idea, discussed among the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), was one reason behind Trump's decision to add taxes.</p>
            <p>The US dollar is used around the world, which gives the US an advantage in the global economy. During the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 6 and 7, Trump criticized the group. He also threatened to punish countries that trade without using the US dollar.</p>
            <p>Lula stressed that Brazil does not want to anger the US. However, Brazil must protect its own important interests. Brazil is not a small country and wants to discuss things as equals.</p>
            <p>Lula said that the US is a very strong country, the most powerful in the world, and also has the most advanced technology and largest economy. But Brazil also wants to be treated with respect. Brazil will never accept taxes being put on it because of a political issue.</p>
            <p>Lula also mentioned that the US criticized former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for his failed attempt to take over the government and go to trial. This was another reason Trump put taxes on Brazil.</p>
            <p>After announcing the 50% tax on Brazil, the US Treasury Department contacted the Brazilian government to start talks. On August 1, Trump said he was willing to talk with Lula.</p>
            <p>Brazil's Economy Minister, Fernando Haddad, said that the Brazilian government will announce new plans in the next few days. These plans will offer financial help to Brazilian businesses affected by Trump's taxes.</p>

            <h1>Tariffs Hit Diners; Silicon Valley Taiwanese Business Owner's Fresh Supermarket Attracts Customers Against the Trend</h1>
            <p>New US tariffs have started, meaning American shoppers might see prices go up again. Hu Li-min, honorary chairman of the Global Monte Jade Science and Technology Association, who has many businesses in the US, said in an interview that his high-end supermarkets are getting more customers. This is because people in Silicon Valley are changing how they eat and going to restaurants less often.</p>
            <p>As new tariffs arrive, prices in the San Francisco Bay Area are starting to move up. Shoppers are facing another round of higher prices.</p>
            <p>However, a recent study by the San Francisco Chronicle about supermarkets found that prices in supermarkets generally have not changed a lot, except for things that are fully imported, like coffee, which have gone up.</p>
            <p>Hu Li-min, the honorary chairman of the Global Monte Jade Science and Technology Association, told CNA that his fancy restaurants might be more affected. But his supermarkets are doing better against rising prices. Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, many young people in Silicon Valley prefer to buy ready-to-cook meals, like bento boxes to heat at home, and they eat out less often.</p>
            <p>He said that people in Silicon Valley have a lot of money to spend. So, if the supermarket goods are good quality, many people will still buy them, even if they cost a bit more.</p>
            <p>Also, supermarkets usually set prices by adding a fixed percentage to the cost they pay for goods. For example, if a pound of fish costs $5 and they add 10% to the price, the selling price is $5.50, and they make $0.50 profit. If the fish cost goes up to $10, the selling price becomes $11, and they make $1 profit. So, they actually earn more money.</p>
            <p>So, since people still need to eat, things like rising prices and tariffs have actually made supermarkets do better business.</p>
            <p>Hu Li-min invested in a Japanese supermarket. Right now, there is only one store in Fremont, a city with many Taiwanese people. Last year, the store made over 20 million US dollars. He plans to open three new stores in the Bay Area by the end of this year and next year.</p>
            <p>In Arizona, the number of Chinese people has grown because TSMC built new factories there. Businesses related to this have also contacted him, hoping to work together.</p>
            <p>Hu Li-min said that the tariffs only affected him when he bought new store equipment, like freezers. At that time, the cost of imported equipment and shipping went up, which put more financial pressure on him. Now, things are stable, but he will need to watch for future policy changes.</p>
            <p>Speaking about Taiwan getting a temporary 20% tariff, Hu Li-min said that the main problem is not the number itself. Instead, it is the difference between Taiwan's tariff and those of Japan and South Korea. This makes traditional industries in Taiwan, which are already in a weak position, less able to compete on price.</p>
            <p>As talks between Taiwan and the US continue, Hu Li-min believes that Taiwan faces a more difficult situation in these talks. This is because the US is the biggest market, Taiwan sells much more to the US than it buys, and the US wants Taiwan's computer chips.</p>
            <p>He thinks that if Taiwan gets a lower tax rate, it might be 15% or 19%, based on other countries' current taxes. President Trump thinks like a businessman, but his time in office is limited. Many countries understand the current situation and are choosing to invest more. They might do their investments in stages and over a longer time to lower the risk of high taxes.</p>
