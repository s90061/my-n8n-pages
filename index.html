            <h1>Afghanistan: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi Visits to Talk About Mining and Joining Belt and Road</h1>
            <p>According to Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Kabul today. He told Kabul that China really wants to look for and dig up minerals in Afghanistan. China also hopes Afghanistan will officially join China's "Belt and Road" plan.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wang Yi met with the acting minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, in Kabul. Both countries want to work together more in many areas.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released notes from the meeting. Wang Yi told Muttaqi that China will keep helping the Afghan government to have lasting peace. He also said China wants to build more trust with Afghanistan and work together more in trade, farming, and other areas.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi also said he hopes Afghanistan will continue to strongly fight against the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which is a terrorist group. He added that if China and Afghanistan work together more on security, it will help their economic cooperation.</p>
            <p>Afghanistan's statement said: "Mr. Wang Yi also mentioned that China plans to start actual mining this year."</p>
            <p>Experts say that poor Afghanistan has a lot of lithium, copper, and iron. These minerals could greatly help China make its supply chains stronger.</p>
            <p>In 2021, the Taliban, a strict Islamic group, took control of Afghanistan again. China was the first country to send an ambassador there. Beijing continues to try to improve its relationship with the Taliban.</p>

            <h1>Recall Group's Motorcycle Parade in Zhubei; Lin Ssu-ming's Motorcade in Zhudong Promotes Against Recall</h1>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Hsinchu County office and a group trying to recall Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmaker Lin Ssu-ming started a motorcycle parade today in Zhubei City. They asked people to vote to recall him. At the same time, Lin Ssu-ming started his own motorcade in Zhudong Township to promote against the recall.</p>
            <p>The vote for Lin Ssu-ming's recall (who represents Hsinchu County's second election area) will be on August 23. The DPP Hsinchu County office and the recall group started their motorcycle parade in Zhubei. About 20 motorcycles had banners and flags saying "Vote yes on 8/23, great recall." They used loudspeakers to share their message. Zhubei City Council members Tseng Yu-ling and Shao Chi-yueh also came to support them.</p>
            <p>Chen Yu-tung, the head of the DPP Hsinchu County office, told reporters that with the vote coming soon, they came back to Zhubei this week to promote their message and keep the public's power strong.</p>
            <p>On the other side, Lin Ssu-ming drove through Zhudong city with KMT lawmaker Lo Chih-chiang. Before the event, he told reporters that he has been working hard in the Parliament to pass laws and get money for local building projects. He said he will continue to help people solve their problems in the future.</p>
            <p>Lo Chih-chiang said that Lin Ssu-ming is a hard worker and always puts public welfare laws first. He hopes that the hardworking Lin Ssu-ming can do more to serve and help Hsinchu. He asked people to vote against the recall.</p>
            <p>Later, Lin Ssu-ming went to an event in Hsinchu City that supported referendums and opposed bad recalls. Lo Chih-chiang, KMT lawmaker Hsu Chiao-hsin, and Taiwan People's Party chairman Ko Wen-je also spoke. They all asked voters to oppose the recall.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan and Japan Share Border Control Information; Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association Says It's Not For a "Taiwan Emergency"</h1>
            <p>Foreign news reported that Taiwan and Japan signed an agreement to share information about foreigners who want to travel from Taiwan to Japan. This is to stop spies from entering Japan during difficult times. The Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association confirmed today that they signed a cooperation agreement last year to share immigration information. But they said it is not because they are worried about a "Taiwan emergency."</p>
            <p>Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun" newspaper quoted unnamed sources. It reported that Japan and Taiwan have signed an agreement to share information about foreigners wanting to enter Japan from Taiwan. This is to stop spies and others from entering Japan if there is an emergency in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association replied to a question from CNA in the evening. They said that on December 18 last year, the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association and the Taiwan-Japan Relations Association signed a "Memorandum of Cooperation Between the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association and the Taiwan-Japan Relations Association Regarding Information Sharing on Immigration Matters." This means they will share information related to border control.</p>
            <p>The Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association explained that this agreement helps both sides' authorities to do their jobs effectively according to immigration laws. The goal is to share information to help with border control. They repeated that this agreement is not because they are thinking about a "Taiwan emergency."</p>
            <p>Regarding this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said on the evening of August 19 that Taiwan and Japan did not sign a cooperation agreement specifically for a "Taiwan emergency." Taiwan has also not shared such information with other countries on its own. However, they are happy to see Taiwan and Japan continue to work more closely on immigration matters and build a stronger partnership.</p>
