            <h1>China to Hold Big Military Parade; EU Envoys May Not Attend Because Putin Will Be There</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" has learned that European diplomats in Beijing are talking about whether they should attend a large military parade in China next month. They are thinking about this because Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to be there, and Russian soldiers might also take part.</p>
            <p>The "South China Morning Post" reported that five sources said EU diplomats in Beijing were asked to join the parade and other events that day. However, Putin's attendance makes them very worried, especially because Russia has increased its attacks on Ukrainian land.</p>
            <p>One source said that as the war in Ukraine continues, some European diplomats feel unsure about "being in the same place as the troops that invaded Ukraine," even if it is not yet confirmed if Russian troops will be in the parade.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin said in June that Putin would visit China from August 31st to September 3rd. He will go to the military parade that celebrates the end of World War II and will also attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.</p>

            <h1>Before Trump-Zelenskyy Meeting, Russian Air Strike Hits Kharkiv, Causing Many Deaths and Injuries; Residents Don't Trust Talks</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is expected to meet with U.S. President Trump soon to talk about how the war between Russia and Ukraine might end. Before this meeting, Russia continued to attack Ukraine from the air. This morning, drones attacked Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. At least seven people died, including a 1.5-year-old girl, and many more were hurt. Rescue work is still happening, so the number of dead and injured might go up.</p>
            <p>A reporter saw one of the damaged places in Kharkiv. A 5-story apartment building in an industrial area had a big hole blown in its roof. The outside walls were black from smoke, and there was broken glass everywhere. The area was a mess. Rescue workers were using diggers to remove the rubble and speed up the rescue. One body was covered and lay next to an ambulance, waiting to be moved.</p>
            <p>Many residents watched, looking sad. A couple saw their building destroyed and felt very upset. A man named Zhenya said that when the attack happened, his family of four was sleeping. A sudden loud noise broke their windows, and thick smoke quickly filled their home. He first helped his wife and two young children go to the hallway, then ran with them to a nearby park to be safe.</p>
            <p>"Then there were more explosions, until our air defense system started fighting back," Zhenya said. He pointed to a large hole in the outside wall of the building, saying that was where their home used to be. "Everything is gone; everything is destroyed." Now, his family is staying in a temporary shelter.</p>
            <p>Zhenya said that the apartment building had about 100 homes, and about 70% of them were lived in. He did not understand why this place was attacked. "This is not a military place. Regular families live here, with children, young people, and old people."</p>
            <p>Their neighbors, a family of three, including a 1.5-year-old baby girl, died in the attack. Zhenya's wife, Anna, remembered, "I remember the baby stroller was always outside our door. That child was still learning to walk."</p>
            <p>Zhenya's mother, Svetlana, rushed to the scene when she heard the news and was very upset. "Why is the United Nations silent? Why are you filming our pain? Why does no one ask why these things are happening? Especially after the Alaska summit!"</p>
            <p>Last week, Trump and Russian President Putin met in Alaska, USA, to talk about the Russia-Ukraine war. Although they didn't reach an agreement, Reuters reported that Putin suggested using the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine as one condition for a ceasefire, asking Ukrainian troops to leave the areas they still control. Zelenskyy later also said he was willing to stop fighting. He suggested freezing the current front lines and discussing who owns the land. He also hoped to get security help like NATO provides.</p>
            <p>Oleg, a local resident, said he did not trust talks. "This war was started by one person, and only he can end it. We, or the president, cannot change anything," he said. "We can only keep fighting and hold onto our weapons. This is how we can defeat them."</p>
            <p>Yevgen Vasilenko, a spokesperson for the Kharkiv Regional Emergency Services, said that three drones attacked the local industrial area early in the morning. This started a big fire, covering about 100 square meters. Firefighters are still putting out the fire, clearing the area, and looking for people, which makes the rescue harder.</p>
            <p>According to Igor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv, around 5 AM, five suicide drones attacked the city. Many people died or were hurt, including a 1.5-year-old girl.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy posted on social media that this attack was Russia showing disrespect before the upcoming meeting between the U.S. and Ukraine. He said that Russia's continued fighting and killing is a clear challenge to the political efforts of Europe and the U.S. "This is why we ask for international help to stop this killing; this is also why Ukraine needs security guarantees," Zelenskyy said. "Russia should not get any praise after starting a war. The war must end, and Moscow should hear the word 'stop'."</p>
