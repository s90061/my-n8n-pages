            <h1>Taiwan's Young Team Beats USA to Win Junior League Baseball World Series</h1>
            <p>The final game of the yearly "Junior League Baseball World Series" happened today at noon in Taylor, Michigan. Taiwan's team, the Zhongshan Junior High School baseball team from Taichung City, won against the USA champion, the Georgia team from the Southeast region. Taiwan won 8 to 1 and became the overall champion, staying undefeated.</p>
            <p>The office in Chicago shared a press release this afternoon. It said that after Taiwan's team won, President Lai Ching-te and Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim quickly sent congratulation messages. They congratulated the young players for winning again and bringing honor to the country. The Chicago office then gave them the awards.</p>
            <p>The office also mentioned that the Zhongshan Junior High School team from Taichung City has played for Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region four times. Each time, they have won the championship, which means they have a 100% win rate.</p>
            <p>At the final game, almost 300 Taiwanese people living in Michigan came to support the team. They waved national flags and cheered loudly for the Taiwan team. In the evening, the Chicago office also gave money for a celebration dinner on behalf of Foreign Minister Joseph Wu. This was to reward the young players.</p>
            <p>On August 4th this year, the Detroit Tigers baseball team had its first "Taiwan Day." On that day, all the players and their parents watched a game between Canada and the Tigers after their own game. They got to see the top players from Major League Baseball, which is the highest level of baseball in the world.</p>

            <h1>Chen Yi-hsin Throws First Pitch at Major League Baseball Game, "Holiday Flying Knifeman" is Back, Catcher Praises Good Control</h1>
            <p>The San Diego Padres baseball team held a Taiwan Culture Day event. Chen Yi-hsin, a famous Taiwanese pitcher known as the "Holiday Flying Knifeman," threw the first pitch. He wore a Taiwan shirt with his well-known number 17. The catcher who caught his ball said, "His control was very accurate. He is the best first-pitch thrower I have ever caught."</p>
            <p>The San Diego Padres played against the Boston Red Sox at home today. Before the game, there was a Taiwan Day event. Taiwanese pop songs by bands like Mayday and S.H.E were played on a big stage behind the center field. 1,500 Taiwanese people enjoyed the event together, wearing special hats with the Republic of China flag on them.</p>
            <p>In one part of the stadium, the Padres' team logo was changed to look like the Republic of China flag. Many Taiwanese people took pictures there.</p>
            <p>Dai Yu-cheng, a retired baseball player who started the Padres' Taiwan Day, now works as a baseball coach in Southern California. He said the main goal was to invite Taiwanese people to watch the game together and help more people learn about Taiwan. He added, "We want everyone to know that Taiwan is a country, and we are a very independent and free place."</p>
            <p>The United States is a country with many different groups of people. These groups often use baseball games to show their culture and traditions and to become more visible. Today was the first Taiwan Day for the Padres team, and they invited Chen Yi-hsin, a legendary pitcher from Taiwanese baseball, to throw the first pitch.</p>
            <p>The day Chen Yi-hsin threw the first pitch was a Sunday. This was special because his old nickname "Holiday Flying Knifeman" meant he often pitched well on holidays. Before Chen Yi-hsin came out, the announcer told the crowd about his career. He played in both Japanese and Taiwanese professional baseball, and he had over 1,000 strikeouts.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-hsin told a reporter that he is now 62 years old. He said, "If I were still young, I would want to pitch at the highest level of baseball." He came to throw the first pitch today feeling relaxed, wanting to experience the excitement of American baseball.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-hsin said he had been away from the baseball field for a long time. He had thrown first pitches in Taiwan before, but he was very excited to be on the pitcher's mound in Major League Baseball this time. He said, "I trained extra hard these last few days to throw a good pitch. My whole body hurt after throwing."</p>
            <p>Everywhere Chen Yi-hsin went, if he met a Taiwanese person, they would happily ask to take a picture with him. One fan brought a poster of Chen Yi-hsin from when he was a player. This fan traveled more than 8 hours by car from San Francisco just to see Chen Yi-hsin throw the first pitch.</p>
            <p>Before Chen Yi-hsin stood on the pitcher's mound to throw the first pitch, he practiced throwing on the grass in the outfield with a young helper. Maria, the female helper who usually catches for first-pitch guests, told a reporter, "He is the best first-pitch thrower I have ever caught. You could feel that he used to be a player; his control was very accurate."</p>

            <h1>US Ambassador to NATO: Zelenskyy Might Attend Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>The United States Ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, said today that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy might go to the meeting between the US and Russia. This meeting will happen this week in Alaska. Leaders in Europe are strongly encouraging Ukraine to be part of these discussions.</p>
            <p>According to a news report, Whitaker was asked on CNN if Zelenskyy might join the talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15.</p>
            <p>He replied, "Yes, I really think it's possible. Of course, we cannot make an agreement that everyone involved does not agree with. I mean, clearly, ending this war is the most important thing."</p>
            <p>There were worries that if Zelenskyy was not there, the planned meeting would result in an agreement where Kyiv would have to give up a lot of land. The European Union is against such an outcome.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy has been doing a lot of diplomatic work. In three days, he talked on the phone with 13 leaders, including those from Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, who strongly support Ukraine.</p>
            <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said today that he hopes and believes Zelenskyy will be at this meeting.</p>
