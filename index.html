TSMC's second factory in Kumamoto, Japan, has delayed its start. This decision is partly to put more money into its US factories. This is happening because former US President Trump might put taxes on chips that come from other countries.

The Wall Street Journal newspaper said that this delay shows how Trump's strong trade ideas are making investments go to the US, even if it means other countries don't get them. Many big tech companies have promised to make more AI servers in the US, which are currently made in places like Mexico and Taiwan.

Experts say that TSMC is usually very careful with its spending. They were worried about making too many chips. But because Trump said he might tax imported chips, making enough chips in the US became very important for TSMC.

Last year, TSMC announced they would build a second chip factory in Kumamoto, Japan. The Japanese government promised to give over 8 billion US dollars to help.

TSMC's first factory in Kumamoto started making chips last autumn for companies like Toyota. The second factory was supposed to start building early this year. However, TSMC's chairman, C.C. Wei, said in June that the start of the Kumamoto second factory was delayed because of local traffic problems. People who know about the situation said that the second factory in Kumamoto might be delayed even more, and it's hard to say exactly when it will start.

**Juilliard Music School Graduates Come Together for "Journey Through Four Seasons" Concert in Taiwan**

The famous Juilliard School of Music in the US has many talented Taiwanese musicians. In August, these musicians will hold a concert called "Journey Through Four Seasons, A Spiritual Feast." They will play many famous world songs and perform a new piece by Taiwanese composer Chou Tzu-ling, called "Remote Imagery," for the first time in the world.

At a press conference in Taipei today, Tsai Pei-chen, who leads the Taiwan Performing Arts Association, said that this concert will be a special music event that connects different times, seasons, and cultures. Thirty graduates from Juilliard will work together to give music lovers a deep and touching experience.

Tsai Pei-chen explained that the concert will mainly feature "The Four Seasons of Buenos Aires" by Piazzolla. They will also play well-known pieces by Schumann, Saint-SaÃ«ns, Bernstein, and Rachmaninoff.

A special part of the concert will be music related to Taiwan. The association asked Chou Tzu-ling to write "Remote Imagery." This piece is inspired by her experiences and life in the US and shows her feelings of missing home. Sean Jackson, who is from Barbados in the Caribbean, will play a medley of Taiwanese folk songs like "Spring on the Mountain," "Rainy Night Flower," and "Dark Sky" on the organ.

The Taiwan Performing Arts Association also announced plans to help people have equal access to culture and a scholarship program called "Nurturing Talent, Spreading Sound for the Future." Money from ticket sales will help people who need support and music education programs. They will also create a scholarship for students to study at the Juilliard School.

The "Journey Through Four Seasons, A Spiritual Feast" concerts will happen from August 18th to 20th at the National Concert Hall in Taipei, the National Taichung Theater, and the Weiwuying National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts Concert Hall.

**Earthquakes Near Kagoshima: First Group of 13 People Evacuated from Akuseki Island**

Recently, there have been many earthquakes near the Tokara Islands off the coast of Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Japan. Yesterday, there was a strong earthquake with a shaking level of 6 minus. The head of Toshima Village arranged for people on Akuseki Island to leave. The first group of 13 people took a village boat and arrived at the Kagoshima City port this evening.

Japan's NHK reported that the earthquakes near the Tokara Islands have continued today. So far, there have been over 1200 earthquakes with a shaking level of 1 or more. The Japan Meteorological Agency expects more earthquakes, so they are telling people to be careful of strong shaking, possibly up to level 6 minus.

Since June 21st, there have been many earthquakes near Akuseki Island and Kobajima in the Tokara Islands. Yesterday, the strongest shaking was level 6 minus, which made the islanders worried. Toshima Village arranged for those who wanted to leave to go to other places. The first 13 people from Akuseki Island, aged 0 to 80, left.

The 13 people took a village boat this morning to leave Akuseki Island. They arrived at Kagoshima Port in Kagoshima City around 5:50 PM (4:50 PM Taiwan time). The village head, Genichiro Kubo, arranged for them to stay in hotels or with relatives in Kagoshima City for about one week. They might stay longer if the earthquakes continue.

The report said that some islanders still on Akuseki Island want to leave, so Toshima Village will arrange for a second group to be evacuated. They are planning to have a boat pick them up on July 6th.

Mika Arikawa, who evacuated from Akuseki Island to Kagoshima City, said that she "couldn't sleep at night and felt very worried. I really hope to sleep well." About the situation on Akuseki Island, she said, "The residents ask each other if they are safe. When I think that there are still people on the island, I really hope the earthquakes stop soon."

Village head Genichiro Kubo held a press conference this evening. He said that he has asked the Japanese Red Cross through the Kagoshima prefectural government to send nurses to Akuseki Island. Now, three nurses will take care of the islanders' health.

Akuseki Island usually has two nurses from Toshima Village, but more are needed. There are currently 55 people still on the island.

Since June 21st, there have been frequent earthquakes in Toshima Village. As of this evening at 5 PM, there have been 1203 earthquakes with a shaking level of 1 or more.
