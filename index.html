            <h1>Overseas Anti-Communist Groups Call for Action to Overthrow Chinese Rule</h1>
            <p>People outside China who are against the Communist Party have joined together. They have started to announce a "National Resistance Movement Declaration" in big cities like New York, Washington, London, and Tokyo. They hope to encourage people inside China to unite and fight. Their goal is to remove the current government and help China become a democracy. The declaration also strongly criticizes the Communist Party for threatening Taiwan with military force.</p>
            <p>The "National Resistance Movement Declaration" global launch event started yesterday and will last for two days. It is organized by China Action and the Citizen Resistance Association. Events are happening in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Berlin, Sydney, Toronto, and Tokyo.</p>
            <p>The event in Washington took place this morning in front of the U.S. Capitol building. About 10 Chinese people living in the Washington D.C. area held signs. These signs said things like "Time is up, roll the ball" and "Stop CCP, Free China." They also shouted slogans like "Communist Party, get out!" and "Xi Jinping, step down!" to share their demands.</p>
            <p>Yang Zili, who was in charge of the Washington event, spoke to the Central News Agency. He said he hopes this event will make people in China unite and "rise up to fight" to help China become a democracy.</p>
            <p>Those present also read the declaration. It said that it is time to act to end the current rule and start a new era of freedom and democracy. It also said, "We call for a clear timeline: within three years, we will start a nationwide resistance movement" to reach this goal. "We strongly believe that only by removing the current government and making big changes" can China solve its serious economic and social problems.</p>
            <p>The declaration clearly stated that when a government completely fails to protect its people's rights, "the people have the right, and must, change or get rid of it."</p>
            <p>The declaration also listed many problems with the Chinese government. These include harshly treating Tibetans and Uyghurs, destroying freedom and law in Hong Kong, and threatening and bullying Taiwan with military force.</p>
            <p>Yang Zili pointed out that the declaration is against the Chinese Communist Party using force to unite Taiwan. He said, "We care about Taiwanese people being able to have freedom and live in a free system... We do not want them to lose their freedom and rights like the people of Hong Kong."</p>
            <p>After these events in big cities around the world, there will be more activities in the future. Yang Zili said that this is a long-term effort to raise awareness. He believes more people need to agree on the goal over time.</p>
            <p>He said that the movement for democracy moves forward in waves. "We hope to combine with the protests for democracy and rights inside China, which can finally lead to promoting democracy in the country and removing the dictator," he added.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: U.S. State Department Spokesperson Chosen for Deputy U.N. Ambassador Role</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced on social media today that he has chosen Tammy Bruce, the spokesperson for the State Department, to be the next U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Bruce has been the State Department spokesperson since Trump became president in January of this year.</p>
            <p>Trump announced Bruce's nomination on social media and praised her for doing "excellent work" as the State Department spokesperson.</p>
            <p>Bruce has supported the Trump government's foreign policy. This includes stopping immigrants, taking away visas, and the U.S. responses to the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas. She also defended a plan to send armed aid to the Gaza Strip, which many people criticized.</p>
            <p>Bruce worked as a political writer and commentator for Fox News for over 20 years before this.</p>

            <h1>Explosion at Hezbollah Weapons Depot Kills 6 Lebanese Soldiers</h1>
            <p>The Lebanese military said that an explosion happened today at a weapons storage place near the border with Israel. This explosion killed six soldiers. Military sources said that the soldiers were taking away weapons from a Hezbollah base at the time.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Lebanese army has been in the southern part of the country. This is part of a peace agreement signed last year, which ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah. The army's job is to destroy the structures of Hezbollah, an armed group supported by Iran, in that area.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, the Lebanese government decided to take away Hezbollah's weapons. It asked the army to make a plan to finish this by the end of the year. However, Hezbollah said it will not follow this decision made by the cabinet, even though the United States put a lot of pressure on them. Iran, which supports Hezbollah, also said today that it is against this action.</p>
            <p>The Lebanese military released a statement saying that, in an early report, six soldiers died. They were inspecting and removing weapons from a storage place in Wadi Zibqin, in the Tyre area, near the Israeli border.</p>
            <p>A military source, who wished to remain anonymous, told AFP that the explosion happened "inside a Hezbollah military facility." At the time, the soldiers were "cleaning up ammunition and unexploded bombs left over from the recent war."</p>
