            <h1>Reuters: US State Department Spokesperson Nominated by Trump as Deputy UN Ambassador</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump announced today on social media that he has chosen Tammy Bruce, who works as the spokesperson for the State Department, to be the next U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Bruce has been the State Department spokesperson since President Trump started his term in January of this year.</p>
            <p>Trump used social media to announce Bruce's nomination. He said that Bruce has done an "excellent job" as the State Department spokesperson.</p>
            <p>Bruce has supported the Trump government's foreign policy. This includes rules about immigration and cancelling visas. She also supported the U.S. response to the war between Russia and Ukraine, and the war between Israel and Hamas. She also defended a plan to send armed help to the Gaza Strip, which many people did not like.</p>
            <p>Before this, Bruce worked at Fox News for more than 20 years. She wrote about politics and shared her opinions.</p>

            <h1>Hezbollah Arms Depot Explodes, 6 Lebanese Soldiers Die</h1>
            <p>The Lebanese army stated that an arms storage area close to the Israeli border exploded today. This caused the death of six soldiers. People from the military said that these soldiers were taking away ammunition from a Hezbollah base when it happened.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that a peace agreement ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah last year. After this agreement, Lebanese soldiers were sent to the south of the country. Their job was to destroy the weapons and buildings of Hezbollah, a group supported by Iran, in that area.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, the Lebanese government decided to take away Hezbollah's weapons. They asked the army to make a plan to finish this by the end of the year. However, Hezbollah said it will not follow this decision made by the government, which was under a lot of pressure from the United States. Iran, which supports Hezbollah, also said today that it does not agree with this action.</p>
            <p>The Lebanese army released a statement. It said that early information shows six soldiers died. They were inspecting and removing items from an arms depot. This happened in Wadi Zibqin, in the Tyre area, which is near the Israeli border.</p>
            <p>A military source, who wanted to remain unnamed, told AFP that the explosion happened "inside a Hezbollah military building." The unit was "cleaning up ammunition and bombs that did not explode from the recent war" at that time.</p>

            <h1>At Least 365 People Arrested by London Police for Supporting Banned Pro-Palestine Group</h1>
            <p>London police in the United Kingdom arrested at least 365 people today. They were arrested for supporting a group called "Palestine Action." This protest was the newest and largest one since the British government made the group illegal last month, using anti-terrorism laws.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Metropolitan Police Service in London said they arrested hundreds of people. The reason was "supporting a banned group." Many people think this was one of the biggest arrests ever in London.</p>
            <p>Police also arrested 7 other people for different crimes. These included attacking police officers. But no one was seriously hurt.</p>
            <p>In early July, the British government declared "Palestine Action" an illegal organization. This was because some members of the group entered a Royal Air Force base in southern England without permission and damaged two airplanes. The damage was estimated to cost 7 million British pounds (about 280 million New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Before today's protest, the UK Home Office said again that Palestine Action is also believed to have committed other "serious attacks." These attacks involved "violence, causing great harm, and damaging property a lot."</p>
            <p>However, some groups and people have strongly criticized the UK government for this action. These critics include non-government organizations like the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Greenpeace. They said it was "too much policing" and that it puts freedom of speech at risk.</p>
