The US economy looks quite stable, with stock markets going up, prices staying steady, and many people having jobs. This is happening even after President Trump put new taxes on imported goods, made rules stricter for immigrants, and passed a big tax cut law.

But experts are still worried. They see some signs that things might change. For example, the US bought a lot of goods from other countries, which made its economy grow less in the first three months of this year. People also spent less money. If the US does not agree on new trade rules with other countries by July 9, the taxes on imported goods might become even higher.

Also, fewer immigrants are working in the US because some have left or been sent away. This could mean some jobs won't have enough workers, and wages might go up too fast. An expert said the economy is not getting worse, but it's not getting much better either.

Even though prices have been stable (only 2.4% higher than last year in May), the US central bank decided not to lower interest rates yet. Experts are watching closely to see if new taxes on goods, government job cuts, or immigration changes will cause many people to lose their jobs. If the higher taxes on imported goods return, some experts believe the US economy could slow down a lot in the second half of the year.

**Colombia: Police Arrest Man Behind Candidate Shooting**

Police in Colombia have arrested another person linked to the shooting of presidential candidate Miguel Uribe. They say this man, Elder Jose Arteaga Hernandez, hired a 15-year-old boy to shoot Uribe.

Uribe, a politician, was shot three times on June 7 while giving a speech in Bogota, the capital city. Two bullets hit his head, and he is still in the hospital with serious injuries. Police said Hernandez planned the attack, hired the young shooter, and gave him the gun.

So far, five people have been arrested, including the 15-year-old who did the shooting. Hernandez has a criminal record and was known to Interpol, an international police group. The young shooter is thought to be part of a group of hired killers. He told police he was paid more than $4,800 by a local drug boss to shoot Uribe.

The 15-year-old was arrested just minutes after the attack. Uribe comes from a famous political family. His grandfather was a past president, and his mother died in 1991 during a failed rescue after she was kidnapped by a drug lord named Pablo Escobar.

**Typhoon Danas Approaches Taiwan, Strongest Impact Today**

Taiwan's weather agency announced sea and land warnings for Typhoon Danas. The typhoon is expected to move north along the Taiwan Strait, near the southwest part of Taiwan. Early on July 6, the weather agency expanded the land warning to include 15 counties and cities, like Hsinchu and Miaoli. Today, July 6, will be the day Danas has the biggest effect on Taiwan.

Because of the typhoon, the weather agency has also warned about heavy rain for 19 counties and cities. Some cities and counties in southern Taiwan, like Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung, have canceled work and school for July 6. Penghu County will also cancel work and school after 12 PM on July 6.

All flights within Taiwan for July 6 are canceled. Some other transportation services and events have also changed due to the typhoon. Also, the first day of the 2025 Civil Service Senior Examination has been postponed. Because people expected the typhoon to affect food supply, vegetable prices in Taipei went up by 17%.
