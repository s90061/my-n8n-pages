            <h1>99.9% of Homes in Chiayi Have Electricity Again; President Lai Visits Yizhu to Thank Repair Workers</h1>
            <p>Chiayi County, July 18 (CNA) Typhoon Danna hit the coastal areas of Chiayi County hard on July 7. This caused power outages for over 250,000 homes. After Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) worked day and night, 99.9% of the homes now have electricity again. President Lai Ching-te went to Yizhu at noon today to thank the repair workers.</p>
            <p>Taipower's Chiayi office shared in a news release that President Lai went to Taipower's Songmei Repair Station in Yizhu Township today. He visited the Taipower workers there. He listened to a report about how the area is getting back to normal after the disaster and about the progress of power repairs. He thanked and encouraged the repair workers. He said he was grateful to the Taipower staff on the front lines for starting work quickly after the disaster and for continuing to fight. This helped power come back little by little after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that President Lai's care was real support and encouragement for the workers on site. President Lai also signed the workers' "Whampoa backpacks" (work backpacks) and work clothes.</p>
            <p>Taipower stated that by 5 PM today, 99.9% of the homes in the Chiayi area had power again. About 212 homes still need power to be fixed. These homes are mostly in far-off areas of Yizhu Township and Budai Township. Most of the remaining homes without power are at the end of the power lines. To fix these, workers need to set up poles one by one and put up lines section by section. This makes the work much harder and takes more time.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that many people from other Taipower offices across Taiwan helped in this long and difficult repair effort without complaining. Also, the public gave warm support, bringing cool drinks on sunny days and food during meal times.</p>
            <p>Taipower reminded people that if they are in an area where power has been restored but their home still has no electricity, they can use the "Taiwan Power APP" or call the 1911 customer service line to report it. Taipower will send someone to check right away. (Edited by Hsieh Ya-chu) 1140718</p>

            <h1>New Book "Pingtung Land Crabs" Released, Sharing 20 Years of Protection Efforts</h1>
            <p>Pingtung County, July 18 (CNA) Houwan in Pingtung has many land crabs. With help from the Pingtung County Government, the Taiwan Animal Protection Administrative Oversight Alliance has published a special book called "Pingtung Land Crabs, Thank You, Crabs!" This book shares almost 20 years of environmental protection work. A book launch event was held today to share it with the public.</p>
            <p>The book launch for "Pingtung Land Crabs, Thank You, Crabs!! A True Story of Land Exchange for Conservation in Houwan" was held today at the Pingtung Tobacco Culture Base (Pingtung 1936 Cultural Base). Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi and environmental protection workers were there.</p>
            <p>The book talks about how starting in 2006, Houwan, Checheng Township, Pingtung, faced the building of a fancy hotel. People and the community worked together and suggested a new plan to protect land by exchanging it. The county magistrate at that time, Pan Meng-an, strongly supported this. In the end, the company building the hotel agreed and worked together. This successfully saved the most important land crab home in Taiwan. It was the first time in Taiwan that private groups and the government worked together to change land use to protect nature.</p>
            <p>During the meeting, Magistrate Chou Chun-mi said that protection work is passed from one person to the next. After she became magistrate, her team and the Directorate General of Highways and Kenting National Park Headquarters helped create Taiwan's first continuous land crab nature path. This path to protection was not easy, but it shows everyone that protecting the environment and local growth can happen together. This is something Pingtung people are proud of and a good example of how Taiwan can develop in a lasting way.</p>
            <p>Magistrate Chou Chun-mi said that Houwan has always been the home of land crabs, and they have a duty to protect them and pass this on. Because everyone worked to protect the land crabs, this important land crab home was saved. She invited everyone to visit Houwan and see the results of the protection work and the beauty of local life.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Government mentioned that the new book includes pictures of 29 types of land crabs, along with stories and lesson plans. It is good for families and students to learn about land crab nature. It is an important book that combines environmental education and travel value. (Edited by Lung Po-an) 1140718</p>
