            <h1>Taichung City Approves Project to Fix Drainage Near Two Universities</h1>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that the city has set aside 150 million New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) to fix a big problem with water drainage. This problem is especially bad between Hungkuang University and Providence University in the coastal area of Taichung. When it rains heavily, motorcycles often get pushed over by the strong water. The city also got an extra 18 million NTD for this project, and it should be finished by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>The Taichung office of the Ministry of Agriculture's Rural Development and Soil and Water Conservation Agency has approved a plan for Taichung City. This plan is called "Taichung City Shalu District Providence University and Hungkuang University Campus Area and Traffic Safety Road Improvement Projectâ€”Hungkuang University to Beishi Stream Section Slope Drainage Improvement." This project will receive 9 million NTD from the central government and 9 million NTD from the local government, making a total of 18 million NTD. The city government approved paying this money first in a meeting today, and it will be sent to the Taichung City Council for final approval.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu Shiow-yen explained that even though there are water channels in the area between Hungkuang and Providence universities, the water flows very fast when it rains because of the land's shape. People and motorcycles often get pushed over. This problem has not been fixed for decades. She believes that new ways of building and finding money can fix it. So, 150 million NTD was spent on a 1.5-kilometer section to solve the flooding problem.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that the Hungkuang part of the project is finished, and now they are working on the Providence part. It is expected to be finished by the end of the year. When Typhoon Danas and heavy rains happened recently, the project was tested. They saw that even with a lot of rain, the fast water flow was much better. The city still worked hard to get the money for this.</p>
            <p>Chen Da-tien, the head of Taichung City Construction Bureau, said that the coastal area often suffers from floods. Especially with the strange weather recently, students on motorcycles often got pushed over or the roads turned into "floating rivers" between Hungkuang University and Providence University when it rained heavily. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen cares a lot about fixing floods. Many years ago, she made a plan. Starting last year, 150 million NTD was spent on a 1.5-kilometer section from Hungkuang to Providence to improve drainage and pedestrian roads.</p>
            <p>Chen Da-tien said that they recently got 18 million NTD from the Soil and Water Conservation Agency. The central and local governments will each pay 9 million NTD. This money will be used to make the drainage channels bigger between Hungkuang University and Beishi Stream. During Typhoon Danas and heavy rains this year, the water drained well. This made sure students were safe when going to school and traveling. The whole project will be finished by the end of this year. The money they just got will be used to improve small connecting pipes and sidewalks, which will solve the drainage problems for both universities at once.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry Says China's Claim Over Taiwan Is Not True</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, China's Foreign Ministry said again that Taiwan has always been a part of China, historically and legally. However, Hsiao Kuang-wei, who speaks for Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), said today that China's lies, even if told a thousand times, will not become true. He stated that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are separate and do not belong to each other. This is a real fact. Also, the People's Republic of China has no right to speak for Taiwan in the world.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu recently strongly disagreed with what China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. Minister Wu explained that after World War II, the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" replaced other political statements like the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation." This treaty did not give Taiwan to the People's Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan. In response, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on August 18th called these arguments wrong. She said that Taiwan's belonging to China is a clear historical and legal fact.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei, the MOFA spokesperson, said at a regular press conference this morning that the Chinese Communist Party's lies will not become true even if they say them a thousand times. He said that the current situation in the Indo-Pacific region is very difficult. He noted that in recent years, China has often challenged the "rules-based international order." This has badly harmed democracy, law, human rights, freedom, and even fair trade. This has also made other countries aware, and more and more countries are showing they care about safety and peace in the Indo-Pacific region by sending warships through the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei also said that China has always put pressure on Taiwan in international groups. This includes making laws like the "Anti-Secession Law" and "22 Rules for Punishment of Separatists." China also wrongly changes the meaning of UN Resolution 2758. They try to use this resolution to attack Taiwan by force, stop Taiwan from joining international activities, and then say that "Taiwan is a part of China" and "the Taiwan Strait is China's internal sea." These ideas from China are clearly against the truth and democratic values. Many parliaments and governments in other countries have also spoken out strongly against China's wrong explanations.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei repeated what Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said earlier. He stressed that Taiwan started to become more democratic and free from the mid-1980s. This was a movement from the people. In 1996, Taiwan held its first direct election for president. Since then, Taiwan's central government has been chosen by the people of Taiwan. This made it the only legal government that truly controls Taiwan and represents it to the world. It also confirmed that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China exist equally and do not belong to each other.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei said that since then, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has changed ruling political parties three times. This has made Taiwan's democracy stronger and its own identity clearer. It also shows that the people of Taiwan strongly believe in and want freedom and democracy.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei said again that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China being separate is a clear fact. The People's Republic of China also has no right to speak for Taiwan in the world. He asked the government in Beijing to be practical and wise. He said that to make relations between the two sides better, they must talk with Taiwan's elected government. This talk must be based on respect and equality.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei stated that Taiwan will also stand together with other democratic countries. They will work to create a "democracy shield" together. They will face challenges from countries that are not democratic. They will protect shared values and the international rules that keep order.</p>

            <h1>T.T. Tsung-hsien Does Not Comment on Presidential Powers After Mayor's Suggestion</h1>
            <p>Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an suggested that President Lai Ching-te should ask T.T. Tsung-hsien, the chairman of Pegatron company, to form a new government cabinet. This idea has caused many discussions. Today, T.T. Tsung-hsien said that choosing people for the cabinet is the President's power given by the Constitution. He said he would not casually talk about or criticize this matter. He also noted that Premier Cho Jung-tai and his cabinet members are facing a lot of pressure from inside and outside the country, and they are all working very hard.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City office of the Taiwan People's Party is holding a special exhibition called "Starting with Nuclear Power: August 23rd Referendum on Extending Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant" from August 9th to 22nd. It is located near Exit 6 of Ximen MRT station. T.T. Tsung-hsien visited the exhibition this morning. Professor Lee Min from National Tsing Hua University's Institute of Nuclear Engineering and Science gave him a tour. Legislator Liu Shu-bin and Taipei City Council members Chang Chih-hao, Huang Ching-ying, and Lin Chen-yu from the Taiwan People's Party also came with him.</p>
            <p>Before the tour, T.T. Tsung-hsien was asked about Mayor Chiang Wan-an's suggestion for him to form the cabinet. He said he had already answered this question on August 4th. He repeated that forming a cabinet is the President's constitutional power, so he would not comment on it. He also said that the current cabinet and Premier Cho Jung-tai are working very hard and face a lot of pressure from inside and outside. He sent his best wishes and encouragement to all the cabinet members.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked him again if he would accept if President Lai invited him to form the cabinet, T.T. Tsung-hsien said that he had also mentioned on August 4th that "I am not good at it."</p>
            <p>Regarding comments from a media person, Lee Cheng-hao, who said that only 5% of people would vote in the August 23rd referendum, T.T. Tsung-hsien said he had not studied Lee Cheng-hao's opinion. However, he still asked people to go and vote to support extending the life of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant. He explained that Taiwan needs electricity, and it needs good quality electricity that is affordable. It also needs electricity that can support people's daily lives and industries.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked T.T. Tsung-hsien about his recent mention of the Japanese anime "Demon Slayer." They asked if he had any thoughts about how politicians sometimes use "emotional blackmail."</p>
            <p>T.T. Tsung-hsien said that after July 26th, he saw politicians "emotionally blackmailing" each other. For example, people from the same political party were arguing among themselves over issues like women's equality. He felt sad that whether it's a small group or a big political party and country, when they face pressure, they should be more sensible. They should face problems, understand them, and solve them, instead of emotionally blackmailing each other.</p>
            <p>T.T. Tsung-hsien said that "even a small comic has a big lesson in it." For example, in "Demon Slayer," Nezuko was controlled by a spell and became a demon, but she did not want to drink blood or eat people. She kept her human nature. This can be seen as people keeping their original good nature when they are under outside pressure. Also, Nezuko's family member Tanjiro did not give up on her. This family love shows kindness, pity, and trust.</p>
