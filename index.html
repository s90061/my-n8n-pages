            <p>Acbel, a company that makes power supplies, announced changes in its top management today. Lu Yi-hsing, who became the general manager in February this year, has resigned. Hsu Chieh-li, the chairman of Acbel, will now also be the general manager, starting today.</p>
            <p>Acbel sent out a press release saying that Hsu Chieh-li will return to his role as general manager starting today. He will lead the team to put plans into action and grow the business. This change is to make the company's resources work better together. It will also help improve its energy business plans. This change is part of the company's long-term plan. It aims to help the company grow steadily in the next stage. This is because the world's energy systems are changing, and so is the industry.</p>

            <h1>New Local Government Finance Act to be Adjusted; Lu Shiow-yen: Central Government Should Partner with Local Governments</h1>
            <p>Regarding Premier Cho Jung-tai's recent comment about slight adjustments to the new Local Government Finance Act, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that she hopes the central government, the Legislative Yuan, and local governments can work together as partners. This is important to take good care of the people, because all taxes come from every person.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said on August 30th that there are small calculation errors in the new Local Government Finance Act. So, there will be some small changes. It will not be an equal distribution for everyone. He will also invite county mayors and city mayors to the Executive Yuan or visit them in their areas. In short, they will openly work together on money matters between the central and local governments.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen attended the opening ceremony for the reconstructed Peifeng Bridge in Dongshi District, Taichung, today. When talking to reporters, she said that the Legislative Yuan changed the Local Government Finance Act. This was done to give more budget money to Taiwan's 22 counties and cities. Since the Legislative Yuan has already approved the changes, she hopes the Executive Yuan will cooperate well. She wants them to give out the money soon and not delay it with excuses. This would help local governments with their urgent financial problems.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen pointed out that, for example, Taichung paid 250 billion New Taiwan Dollars in taxes to the central government in 2024. However, the central government gave back only over 90 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is less than 100 billion. This is only about 40% of what was paid. It's not just Taichung; almost all 22 counties and cities in Taiwan are in a similar situation. This means that all local governments have big budget gaps. If they don't borrow money, they might have to sell land to get enough funds.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen also mentioned that the central government has adjusted various budgets, not just the general allocation funds. This includes general grants for local governments. Recently, the Executive Yuan sent letters to all counties and cities. These letters said that the grants approved by the central government for local areas last year will not count, and the amount will be reduced. General grants were supposed to be given out fairly using a formula. However, the central government now says that local governments must apply for them, and the Executive Yuan will review the applications. This is not fair.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen stated that she hopes the central government will continue to give general grants to local areas using the old formula, which has been used for many years. She hopes they will not change it to be like the forward-looking budget, where the central government decides who gets the money. She is worried that this might lead to "political screening" of requests.</p>
            <p>She said that she hopes the central government will understand the message from the public votes on July 26th and August 23rd. She wants them to make big changes for the better. This means quickly becoming good partners with the Legislative Yuan and also with all county and city governments. She hopes the central government will take good care of the people and local governments, because all taxes come from every person in the local areas.</p>
