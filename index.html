            <p>In New York, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September went up by 62 cents. It reached $63.42 for one barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price of Brent crude oil for October went up by 75 cents. It reached $66.6 for one barrel.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Zelenskyy Meet, Talk About Ending War, Trump Plans to Call Putin Later</h1>
            <p>(Washington, August 18th) Today, US President Trump welcomed Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for talks at the White House. When reporters asked questions, Trump said Zelenskyy looked good in his black suit. Trump also repeated his ideas about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. He plans to call Russian President Putin after the meeting.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, a reporter asked Trump what he wanted to say to the people of Ukraine after he shook hands with Zelenskyy. Trump said, "We love them."</p>
            <p>He also told Zelenskyy that his black suit looked good. In February this year, when Zelenskyy visited the White House, some right-wing news said he should have worn a suit. At that time, he and Trump had an argument and ended the meeting unhappily.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Brian Glenn, a reporter who had questioned Zelenskyy about not wearing a suit before, told him today, "You look good in that suit."</p>
            <p>Trump quickly said, "I said the same thing." Zelenskyy then told Glenn, "You are still wearing the same suit. I changed, but you did not."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Trump told the media about the Russia-Ukraine war, saying, "I like the idea of a ceasefire."</p>
            <p>But he also said, "We can try to make a peace deal even while they are still fighting." He noted that some recent peace deals were made without asking the fighting countries to stop first.</p>
            <p>Trump said that after his talks today with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, he will call Russian President Putin. Trump had met Putin in Alaska three days ago.</p>
