            <h1>Weather Agency Issues Heavy Rain Warning: Pingtung County to See Local Heavy Rain or Torrential Rain</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's weather agency has given a heavy rain warning. A low-pressure system is causing strong, short rains. Today, Pingtung County will have heavy rain or very heavy rain in some areas. Tainan and Kaohsiung areas might also have heavy rain in some parts. Please be careful of lightning, strong winds, and rivers overflowing. In low areas, be careful of water gathering. Areas from central to northern Taiwan might still have heavy rain today.</p>

            <h1>Trump: Nearly 200 Tariff Letters to Be Sent in the Next Week, Rates 10% or 15%</h1>
            <p>The time limit for America's special tariffs is ending soon. US President Trump said today that most agreements are finished. The US will start collecting specific tariffs directly. In the next week, nearly 200 letters will be sent to tell countries about their new tax rates. These rates could be 10%, 15%, or even lower.</p>
            <p>In early April, Donald Trump started special tariff measures on 'Liberation Day'. Earlier this month, he signed an order to extend the special tariff pause until August 1st. This gives other countries more time to talk with the US. But he also sent over 20 tariff letters to tell trade partners about their new tax rates. Taiwan was not included in these letters.</p>
            <p>As the August 1st deadline gets closer, Trump spoke to the media today at the White House before going to Scotland. He said, most agreements are now done because 'we will simply collect certain tariffs directly'. In the next week, he will keep sending tariff letters to tell countries about the rates, which could be 10%, 15%, or less.</p>
            <p>He said almost 200 tariff letters will be sent. He added, 'Once those letters are sent, we will have an agreement'.</p>
            <p>Before, Trump sent tariff letters to Japan, the European Union (EU), and Canada. He said Japan and the EU came back to talk with the US. After the US and Japan made a trade deal earlier this week, he thinks the EU is also likely to make a deal. But talks with Canada are not going well. Canada might be a country the US taxes directly without more talks.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump is visiting Scotland from today until the 29th. During his visit, he will go to Turnberry and Aberdeen. He will also meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. They will work to make the big trade deal between the US and the UK even better.</p>
            <p>He said they want to talk about some parts of the agreement. They want to 'fine-tune' it more.</p>
            <p>When the media asked if there was room to change the taxes on steel and aluminum, Trump answered that there is no room for change there.</p>
            <p>In May, Trump announced that the US and UK had a trade agreement plan. The UK will let more American products into its market and lower other costs for US goods. The US will still put a 10% tax on goods from the UK. But with the agreement, British car makers can send up to 100,000 cars to the US each year with a 10% special tax. If they send more than that, the tax will go up to 25%.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Trump and Starmer signed a trade deal in June at the G7 meeting. This deal greatly cut the US taxes on British cars and airplane parts. However, the taxes on steel and aluminum are still being talked about.</p>

            <h1>Thai-Cambodian Conflict: CNN Reports US Ally vs. China-Backed Armed Forces</h1>
            <p>There has been a deadly fight at the border between Thailand and Cambodia. US news reports say that one side, Thailand, is a long-time friend of the US and has a stronger army. The other side, Cambodia, has a weaker army but is very close to China.</p>
            <p>CNN says since France, a strong colonial power, drew the border over 100 years ago, Bangkok (Thailand) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) have fought sometimes over land.</p>
            <p>Since the two countries started fighting yesterday, reports say more than ten people have died, and over 100,000 people have left their homes.</p>
            <p>CNN compared the two sides in the conflict based on history and military strength:</p>
            <p>‚óè Thailand is stronger in all numbers</p>
            <p>When we look at the total number of soldiers or military weapons, Thailand is much stronger than its neighbor Cambodia.</p>
            <p>Thailand has 361,000 active soldiers in all its military branches. This is three times more than Cambodia's soldiers. The weapons Thai soldiers have are also much better than what Cambodian soldiers have.</p>
            <p>A report from a UK research group, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), called 'Military Balance 2025', states: 'Thailand has a large army with a lot of money. Its air force is one of the best in Southeast Asia in terms of equipment and training.'</p>
            <p>Also, an Australian research group, the Lowy Institute for International Policy, ranked the military strength of 27 countries in the region. Thailand was 14th, and Cambodia was 23rd.</p>
            <p>It's not surprising that the two countries have such different military strengths. Thailand has four times more people than Cambodia, and its economy (GDP) is more than ten times bigger. Also, unlike Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, Thailand did not suffer from wars in Southeast Asia in the second half of the 20th century, and it was not a European colony before that.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Lowy Institute's 'Asia Power Index', which looks at military, economic, diplomatic, and cultural power, shows that Thailand is ranked 10th. It is behind Indonesia but ahead of countries like Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
            <p>The Lowy Institute puts Cambodia among the smaller countries in Asia. It is similar to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Laos.</p>
            <p>‚óè Thailand's strong relationship with the US and global view</p>
            <p>The military is very important in Thai politics. For many years, Thailand was controlled by conservative groups. These groups included the military, the king, and powerful leaders.</p>
            <p>According to the CIA World Factbook, since 1932, military leaders in Thailand have taken power in 20 coups (times when the military takes control). These coups usually caused democratic governments to fall. The military sees itself as the main protector of the monarchy (the king).</p>
            <p>The US State Department says since 1954, when Thailand signed the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, also called the Manila Pact, with the US, it has been a treaty ally of the US.</p>
            <p>During the Vietnam War, US Air Force B-52 bombers were based at some air force bases in Thailand. Tens of thousands of Thai soldiers also fought alongside US-backed South Vietnamese forces against communist North Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Washington (the US government) has kept its strong relationship with Bangkok (Thailand). It calls Thailand a main ally that is not part of NATO. This has allowed Thailand to get US support for its weapons programs for decades.</p>
            <p>The yearly Cobra Gold exercise, which started in 1982, is held by Thailand and the US Indo-Pacific Command. At first, it was a joint military exercise between Thailand and the US, but later tens of other countries joined.</p>
            <p>The US State Department notes that besides Cobra Gold, Thai and US forces have also done more than 60 joint exercises.</p>
            <p>‚óè Cambodia receives support from China</p>
            <p>According to the IISS, after Cambodia's communist government army joined with two non-communist rebel groups, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces were formed in 1993. This means they are newer than the Thai military.</p>
            <p>The IISS states, 'China and Vietnam are Cambodia's most important international partners for defense. Even though Cambodia traditionally got weapons from Russia, China has become the main supplier now.'</p>
            <p>China has even built a naval base in Cambodia. Experts from different countries say that the Ream Naval Base in the Gulf of Thailand could be a place for China's aircraft carriers to dock.</p>
            <p>Cambodia and China had their seventh 'Golden Dragon' joint military exercise in May this year. It was said to be the biggest ever, and they practiced with real bullets.</p>
            <p>A report from the Chinese military's English website in February this year said the relationship between the two sides is expected to 'enter a new phase and achieve new developments'. This is exactly the support the Cambodian army needs.</p>
            <p>‚óè What happens next?</p>
            <p>US military expert Carl Schuster said that even though Thailand has better military numbers and quality, at least one thing is good for Cambodia: the land along the disputed border.</p>
            <p>He told CNN, 'The land makes it easier to enter the disputed area from Cambodia's side.'</p>
            <p>Schuster also said that Cambodian forces are known to have placed landmines and booby traps in the disputed area. It is expected that Thailand will use long-range weapons.</p>
