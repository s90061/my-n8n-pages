            <h1>Employees Forged Insurance Papers and Took Money; KGI Life Fined NT$2.4 Million</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), announced today that KGI Life Insurance has been fined NT$2.4 million and asked to fix several problems. These problems were found during a regular check of the company's business. Some employees made fake insurance policies and took money that customers paid for their insurance. This goes against the rules in the Insurance Law.</p>
            <p>The FSC's official document shows that KGI Life employees made several mistakes. For example, from 2013 to 2017, a salesperson changed postal payment slips and took money from insurance premiums. They also asked customers to sign empty forms for changing their contracts. Because of this, customers did not receive important updates later. In 2018, another salesperson made a fake policy and took the customer's money. Also, from 2013 to 2020, people who were not sales agents worked at sales offices. They sold insurance and helped customers, and they were also involved in making fake policies and taking customer's money.</p>
            <p>The FSC explained that KGI Life did not follow rules for how insurance companies should manage their business and check their work. The company did not have good ways to stop sales agents from taking money from customers when agents paid premiums for them. Also, the company did not effectively stop agents from making and giving out fake insurance policies. KGI Life did not have a complete system for internal control. So, the company was fined NT$1.8 million for this.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the FSC said that KGI Life allowed people who were not company staff to work and sell insurance at their sales offices. The company did not manage these offices well. This shows that even though KGI Life had rules for management, they did not work. The company's system was not complete. Because of this, KGI Life was fined another NT$600,000.</p>

            <h1>"Year of Her Days" Promoted in Busan; Angela Yuen Praises Sylvia Chang</h1>
            <p>Actors Greg Hsu and Angela Yuen are starring in a fantasy romance movie called "Year of Her Days." They came to South Korea to promote the film at the Busan Film Festival. At a press conference, Angela Yuen openly showed her deep respect for her idol, Sylvia Chang. Yuen said, "Sister Chang is how I think a woman should be." She specially thanked Sylvia Chang for asking her to be in "Year of Her Days."</p>
            <p>Today, the director of "Year of Her Days," Gung Chiu-ping, along with actors Greg Hsu and Angela Yuen, attended a press conference at the Busan Film Festival. When asked about her connection with Sylvia Chang, Angela Yuen clearly showed her admiration for the older actress. She said, "Even today, when I see Sister Chang, I still think, 'You are so beautiful.'" Yuen directly stated that Sylvia Chang is her perfect example of a woman. "She has confidence, but she is not proud, and she has strong leadership skills."</p>
            <p>Angela Yuen shared that she and Sylvia Chang actually worked together on a movie in 2022, but that movie is not out yet. She said, "Even though I haven't seen the last movie we made, she (Sylvia Chang) remembered me from working together on set and wanted to work with me again. This made me very touched and thankful."</p>
            <p>Greg Hsu also said that Sylvia Chang helped them a lot when they were acting together. "We did not have many days to film, and every day was very busy. We basically had to get into character immediately," he said. Because they could not spend much time developing their feelings for the roles, Sylvia Chang gave them a lot of practical help to show their emotions.</p>
            <p>When talking about the most memorable question from the audience during their visit to Busan, Angela Yuen said it was when "a viewer asked why all the characters in the movie are named after food." The audience member explained that in Korea, if characters are named after food, it usually means their lives are difficult. This helped Angela Yuen understand Korean culture better, and she felt a connection with the Korean audience.</p>
            <p>Greg Hsu mentioned that the most common question he was asked was, "Can you accept seeing someone only once a year?" He said he thought about it for a long time and decided, "I cannot." Because of this, he felt that the main characters in the film, Potato and An Ching, are very brave.</p>
            <p>Greg Hsu explained that the movie is not only about the feelings between two people, but its world setting is also very new and interesting. "There are some small details, for example, something I think is very sad can be happy. I really like this contrast." The movie also made him think about how people today often take time for granted, but in the movie, it is not like that. "I think the main idea is to value time."</p>
            <p>Director Gung Chiu-ping said that when he first thought of the movie title, it was based on the idea of "a boy who likes a girl, but his whole life is only a short time in her life." He added, "It naturally feels like this kind of love is not equal, and the girl might not love the boy. But as we looked deeper, we started to discuss why we should measure love by how long it lasts." He said, "Love might exist for just a moment. If that moment of love is strong enough, it can also be eternal love." That is why the English title is "Measure in Love."</p>

            <h1>Thousands of Italians March to Support Palestinians</h1>
            <p>Today, tens of thousands of people in Italy went into the streets. They were part of a national event called "Condemn the Genocide in Gaza." These actions stopped traffic in some areas, and even some ports were closed.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that Western countries like France, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United Kingdom are ready to recognize the State of Palestine today. This will happen during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, USA.</p>
            <p>However, Italy's far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, said that Italy will not recognize the State of Palestine at this time.</p>
            <p>Police in Rome said that about 20,000 people gathered at the Termini train station there. Many of them were students. They shouted "Free Palestine" and waved Palestinian flags.</p>
            <p>Another group marched past the Colosseum in Rome. At the front of their group, they held a very large banner. It said, "Against Genocide, Block Everything."</p>
            <p>In Milan, a city in northern Italy, the organizers of the march said 50,000 people were there. An AFP reporter saw some people burning an American flag.</p>
            <p>According to the police, more than 10,000 people marched in Bologna, another northern city. People also demonstrated in other places like Turin, Florence, Naples, and Sicily.</p>
            <p>Italian news showed that dock workers blocked the ports in Genoa and Livorno. No one could enter or leave.</p>
            <p>City buses and subways in Rome stopped working because of strikes. Italy's national railway company also told travelers that trains might be late or cancelled.</p>
