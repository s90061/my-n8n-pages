            <h1>US Envoy: Putin Agrees to Give Ukraine Safety Promises Through US</h1>
            <p>On August 17, US President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told CNN that Russian President Putin agreed to allow the United States to give "strong safety promises" to Ukraine. This agreement came during a meeting between Putin and Trump and would be part of a possible peace deal.</p>
            <p>Witkoff told CNN's "State of the Union" show host, Jake Tapper, "We agreed on strong safety promises. I would say this could change the situation."</p>
            <p>Witkoff also said that these safety promises are like the protection given by Article 5 of NATO, which helps against more attacks from Russia.</p>
            <p>He added that Putin also agreed to "write it into law" that Russia would not go into any part of Ukraine or other areas of Europe, as part of the possible peace deal.</p>

            <p>He was nominated for an Oscar. He also acted in other movies like "Theorem" in 1968, "A Season in Hell" in 1971, and "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" in 1994.</p>

            <h1>Many European Leaders Join Zelensky for US Visit; BBC Calls It "Never Seen Before"</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is going to Washington to talk with US President Donald Trump. Leaders from Europe and NATO will go with him. The BBC said this is a moment "never seen before," showing that European leaders are a little worried after the meeting between the US and Russia.</p>
            <p>The US wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly. So, Zelensky will fly to Washington tomorrow. He needs to protect Ukraine's interests and try not to argue with Trump again at the White House.</p>
            <p>Today, several leaders announced they would go with Zelensky. These include German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
            <p>At first, it was planned as just a meeting between two leaders. But now, it has grown much bigger, even though Trump and Zelensky might still talk alone.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that this gathering is unusual. It is hard to imagine so many European leaders quickly agreeing to fly across the Atlantic to talk about just one issue.</p>
            <p>European leaders are clearly a bit nervous after Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.</p>
            <p>A main goal for them will be to push for Ukraine to get safety promises after a peace deal with Russia. European leaders also want to talk to Trump about Ukraine's land and make it clear they will keep helping Ukraine.</p>
            <p>In February of this year, Zelensky was publicly criticized by Trump and US Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office. Everyone watched this happen with surprise.</p>
            <p>At that time, Zelensky was asked to leave the White House. It was hard to think that their relationship could get better. But in the months after, European leaders worked quietly to fix things. Leaders who were friends with Trump tried to make Trump like Zelensky.</p>
            <p>Zelensky learned how to give compliments to Trump and how to talk like a businessman.</p>
            <p>In April, Ukraine and the US signed an agreement about minerals. Trump and Zelensky also had a private talk at the Vatican. Ukraine clearly said it wanted to buy weapons from the US.</p>
            <p>By July, Trump and Zelensky talked on the phone. Zelensky called it "our best conversation."</p>
            <p>People still think that Trump is easily influenced by compliments and likes strong leaders. So, Ukraine is still worried about Putin's power over him.</p>
            <p>But Zelensky is still learning. Before the meeting in the Oval Office on the 18th, he has European friends who can help him. Merz said about this: "We will give good advice."</p>
            <p>The BBC noted that Keir Starmer will also play an important part in guiding how Zelensky talks with Trump.</p>
            <p>Starmer has tried to keep a good relationship with Trump. When Starmer visited the White House in February and when Trump recently visited Scotland, the mood was friendly. Starmer and Stubb might be the European leaders closest to Trump.</p>
            <p>The British Prime Minister's office believes Starmer can help at these events. He can be a go-between for Trump and Zelensky.</p>
