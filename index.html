The United States is considering ending exceptions that currently allow foreign chipmakers like Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and TSMC to use American technology in their manufacturing operations in China. These exceptions were first granted after the U.S. put broad export limits on China's semiconductor industry in 2022. China is the world's largest market for semiconductors, and for South Korean and Taiwanese chip companies, having production in China is crucial for their business. This potential decision to remove these exceptions for allies' operations in China marks an important moment in U.S. technology policy.

**UK 'woefully' ill-protected against Chinese and Russian undersea cable sabotage**

A new report from the China Strategic Risks Institute (CSRI) warns that the UK is not adequately prepared for an increasing number of sabotage attacks on vital undersea cables by China and Russia. The report, which looked at 12 incidents since 2021, found that eight of them were linked to China or Russia. It highlights the UK's limited ability to monitor these cables, which are critical for the global economy. These "grey zone" operations pose a serious threat, and the UK needs to improve its defenses to protect this crucial infrastructure.
