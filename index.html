            <h1>High-Speed Rail Extension to Yilan: Former Minister Asks to Stop or Send Back Review</h1>
            <p>Today, a meeting about the environment reviewed a plan to extend the High-Speed Rail to Yilan. The former Minister of Transportation, He Chendan, said that this plan makes the High-Speed Rail seem too good in its report. It does not think about if it's possible or how much it will cost to make all Taiwan Railways trains in the east start from Yilan. He asked the committee to stop reviewing the plan or send it back.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment held its 37th meeting of the Environmental Impact Assessment Committee today. They looked at the first draft of the report for the High-Speed Rail extension to Yilan project.</p>
            <p>In the morning, groups like "Citizens' Support," the "High-Speed Rail Extension to Yilan Monitoring Alliance," the "Taiwan Railway Labor Union," and "Protect Yilan Workshop" held a press conference outside the Ministry of Environment. They asked to "Stop the High-Speed Rail Myth and Treat Regular Trains Fairly."</p>
            <p>Former Minister of Transportation He Chendan supported the groups. He said the plan is "absurd." It uses engineering reports to make High-Speed Rail look great and make Taiwan Railways look bad. He said the planning was rushed, did not involve talks with relevant organizations, and avoided talking to the public. He also said the data was messy and incomplete.</p>
            <p>He Chendan said that the plan's study of how possible it is to build has not finished. The National Development Council does not agree with the claim that the Executive Yuan has approved it. For the people in Yilan, who will be most affected, only one public meeting was held. The developers simply visited the County Council in private or counted community visits as real discussions.</p>
            <p>He Chendan believes this plan only makes the numbers look good. It makes Taiwan Railways' ability and help seem small. It says Taiwan Railways can only wait at the new Yilan Station for High-Speed Rail transfers. But it ignores that all Taiwan Railways trains in the east must start from Yilan, and the huge costs and problems this would cause for train scheduling.</p>
            <p>Qiu Shusheng, a representative from the Taiwan Railway Labor Union, said that this plan is not just about making travel time to Yilan shorter. The real problem is what happens after passengers arrive in Yilan. He also said that a report from the Railway Bureau yesterday suggested how Taiwan Railways should work with the High-Speed Rail after it is built, which is ironic. This shows that the entire eastern railway transport system will be affected.</p>
            <p>Qiu Shusheng said that if the Northern Yilan High-Speed Rail project goes forward, it will directly hurt an important part of Taiwan Railways' business across the island. It will also show that the Ministry of Transportation and the central government will stop trying to make Taiwan Railways a private company. He said this decision affects everything, and as a railway worker, he is against it.</p>
            <p>According to a report from the Ministry of Transportation's Railway Bureau, the Ministry of Transportation invited the Railway Bureau and the current High-Speed Rail company to meetings last year. They discussed the plan for building and running the High-Speed Rail. They had many meetings in groups about engineering, land use, development, operations, laws, and money. All the ideas from these meetings have been included in the plan to meet future needs.</p>
            <p>The Railway Bureau again said that building railways not only solves traffic problems. It is also important for developing Yilan, Hualien, and Taitung areas. The goal is to make it possible to travel around Taiwan by train in 6 hours and help all parts of Taiwan grow equally.</p>

            <h1>Hung Shen-han's Comments on 80-year-old Care Law Anger KMT Lawmakers</h1>
            <p>On the day before a big vote to remove someone from office, Minister of Labor Hung Shen-han wrote on Facebook. He said that a bill allowing people over 80 to hire foreign caregivers without a special health test quickly passed a committee. Today, lawmakers from the KMT party said he was spreading lies. They also said Hung Shen-han was not the Minister when the bill was reviewed. They asked government officials to be professional.</p>
            <p>Before the big removal vote on July 26, Hung Shen-han posted on Facebook. He claimed that the majority in Congress was trying to weaken government organizations. He used the changes to Article 46 of the Employment Service Act as an example. He said the bill quickly passed the committee without proper discussion. He added that opposition lawmakers knew the changes would have a big effect, but they voted for it quickly without enough talk.</p>
            <p>At that time, opposition lawmakers questioned if Hung Shen-han's words were fair. Today, the Legislative Yuan's Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee asked Hung Shen-han to give a special report and answer questions. KMT lawmaker Wang Yu-min was unhappy and asked Hung Shen-han to explain why he thought Article 46 of the Employment Service Act passed so quickly.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-min criticized him, saying that she was the convener at the time. The bill did not pass the committee quickly. It was discussed twice in the committee, and there were also talks between political parties. Later, there was also a public hearing. She asked why Hung Shen-han publicly spread lies on Facebook.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han explained many times that his Facebook post gave examples of several bills. He specifically mentioned Article 46 of the Employment Service Act because it skipped discussions between political parties that the Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu was supposed to hold. He originally hoped for good discussions with lawmakers through these talks.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-min was upset and argued back. She pointed out that Hung Shen-han was also a lawmaker, and "not every bill has to go through discussions with Han Kuo-yu." She said Article 46 of the Employment Service Act was reviewed in the committee. She strongly disagreed with the idea that the bill passed too quickly. She also said Hung Shen-han was not the Minister of Labor when the bill was reviewed and did not take part in the process. She said his "words are completely wrong."</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-min finally said that the original goal of this bill was to make things simpler and easier for people. She said the Ministry of Labor kept making the impact seem bigger and said the changes would have a huge effect. But now, only about 1400 people have applied. She said government officials should act professionally and not make such claims.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han replied that looking at the numbers now, the applications in the second week were double those in the first week. He said that the trend of growth is clear.</p>

            <h1>Hong Kong Media: Chinese Companies in Hong Kong Strictly Follow CCP's Eight Rules</h1>
            <p>According to reports, Chinese state-owned companies in Hong Kong have been strictly learning and following the "Eight Rules" set by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 2012. This has been happening for the past six months. These rules aim to stop bad practices like using public money for meals and holding too many meetings.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported that after China's "Two Sessions" meeting this year, Beijing started a new round of "deeply studying and putting into practice the spirit of the Central Eight Rules." Chinese companies in Hong Kong have also had many learning sessions in the past six months. These included holding study meetings and filling out self-assessment forms.</p>
            <p>The report said that in the past, staff in Chinese companies in Hong Kong followed a less strict "Hong Kong version of the Eight Rules" because of local conditions. But after Beijing started the new study period, the latest rule is that Chinese company staff in Hong Kong must also follow the strict rules from mainland China. There are no longer special "Hong Kong Eight Rules" that allow for more flexible handling.</p>
            <p>The report quoted a pro-Beijing person from Hong Kong's political establishment. This person said that while the rules for politics in Hong Kong are different from mainland China, earlier, the establishment started to learn about the "Eight Rules." For example, they learned "how to fix too much bureaucracy and luxury. People should always think about this," especially when holding celebrations or dinners.</p>
            <p>The "Eight Rules" are rules within the Chinese Communist Party. They were approved on December 4, 2012, by a meeting of the 18th Central Political Bureau of the CCP. These rules ask for fewer meetings and documents. They also ask for strict saving, honest governance, and strict rules for how officials live.</p>
