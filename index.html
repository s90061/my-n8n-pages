            <h1>New Taipei's First Indigenous Ceremony Square Starts Building, Aims to Finish by End of February 2026</h1>
            <p>Today, work started on New Taipei City's first special place for indigenous people's yearly ceremonies. Mayor Hou Yu-ih said it should be finished by the end of February 2026. After it's done, indigenous people will have their own place to use. The city government will also combine nearby resources to help share indigenous culture.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou said that over 62,000 indigenous people live in New Taipei City, which is the second highest number among Taiwan's six main cities. In the past, indigenous people often had to use temporary places like basketball courts, parking lots, or river parks for their ceremonies and cultural events in the city. To meet the needs of these people, the New Taipei City government decided to build the ceremony square next to the Longenpu public housing in Sanxia District.</p>
            <p>He also stated that the total cost for this ceremony square project is NT$30.7 million. The Council of Indigenous Peoples will give more than NT$19.5 million. The design will mix indigenous cultural styles with modern building methods. In the future, it will also bring together nearby places for tourism, education, and social services to help spread indigenous culture.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou explained that the main roof will be a steel frame with a thin dome, 30 meters wide. Its curved shape is inspired by indigenous headwear. The floor will have different colors to show directions, which is good for ceremonies. The columns will have mosaic patterns. For the entrance design, indigenous artists, representatives, and local indigenous groups will work together to plan it, making sure it shows local cultural features.</p>
            <p>Also, Mayor Hou announced that to support indigenous leaders and the heads of indigenous development associations in different areas, who have worked for a long time on public matters for their people and helped the city government with indigenous affairs, their work allowance will increase next year. Each indigenous leader will get an extra NT$1,000 every month.</p>
            <p>Qucung Qalavangan, the Vice Chairperson of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, said that as more indigenous people live in cities each year, it's very important to create public service spaces and cultural ceremony areas for them. He hopes this ceremony square will be finished on time and be of good quality. This will give indigenous people in New Taipei City's urban areas a great place to keep their culture alive.</p>

            <h1>To Fight Drug Cartels, the US Sends More Ships to the Southern Caribbean</h1>
            <p>Today, two sources who know about the plans said that the United States has ordered more ships to be sent to the Southern Caribbean Sea. This is part of President Trump's effort to deal with the danger from drug cartels in Latin America.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the sources, who wanted to remain anonymous, said that the missile cruiser "USS Lake Erie" and the nuclear-powered fast attack submarine "USS Newport News" will arrive in the Caribbean area by the start of next week.</p>
            <p>The sources did not say what the exact mission of this deployment is. However, they said that the recent actions aim to deal with the threat to US national security from groups in this area that are called "drug terrorist organizations."</p>
            <p>Last week, sources told Reuters that the US had ordered an amphibious squadron to be sent to the Southern Caribbean Sea. This is also part of the same operation.</p>
            <p>Trump has made fighting drug cartels a main goal of his government. This is part of a bigger plan to limit immigration and make the southern border of the United States safer.</p>

            <h1>Yushan National Park, a High-Density Habitat for Black Bears; Hikers Rarely See a Mother and Cub</h1>
            <p>Yushan National Park is a place where many Formosan black bears live. Recently, hikers saw a mother black bear and her cub on the Walami Trail in Hualien County. The hikers told the Yushan National Park Management Office. The office said that visitors who go hiking on the Walami Trail can borrow bear bells from the Nanan Visitor Center.</p>
            <p>Yushan National Park is one of Taiwan's protected areas with the most wild animals and habitats. It is also the only place where many Formosan black bears, a special type of bear found only in Taiwan, are known to live. In recent years, there have been more reports of black bear sightings in the park, especially on the Walami Trail in the eastern part of the park. The Yushan National Park Management Office reminds people to hike with others in Yushan and to use bear bells. This helps to avoid meeting a bear unexpectedly.</p>
            <p>Today, the Yushan National Park Management Office posted on its Facebook page. It said that to help people better understand black bears and how to live with them, they asked the Taiwan Wild One Wildlife Conservation Association to create a real-life puzzle game. This game teaches about protecting black bears, helping injured animals, and how to safely be with wild animals. Staff members recently tried this game at the Nanan Management Station in Zhuoxi Township, Hualien County, and had a lot of fun.</p>
            <p>The Yushan National Park Management Office said that soon after trying the puzzle game, a hiker reported seeing Formosan black bears on the Walami Trail. It was a very rare sight of a mother and her cub. After the hiker saw them, the mother and cub quickly left the area. This sighting matches what we already know about how black bears behave.</p>
            <p>The Yushan National Park Management Office said that if visitors see a black bear in the mountains, they should not get too excited and go close to take pictures. Especially if you see a cub, the mother bear might think humans are a danger to her cub. Disturbing them could even make the mother and cub get separated. So, if you suddenly see a Formosan black bear, you should stay calm and quietly leave. Do not stay there or take photos to share online. This will prevent danger and avoid upsetting the bears.</p>
            <p>The Yushan National Park Management Office said that Formosan black bears eat both plants and animals, and they have a very good sense of smell. When you go into the mountains, you should handle your food carefully. Make sure to properly store all food waste and trash and take it back down the mountain. This will stop bears from coming close to trails and mountain cabins to find food, which can increase the risk of problems between bears and people.</p>
