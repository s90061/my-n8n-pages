Heavy rains in central Texas have caused floods, and at least 70 people have died. A summer camp for girls called "Camp Mystic" was washed away by the sudden water.

Rescue teams are still looking for missing people, including 11 girls and a camp worker. In Kerr County, where the camp is, 59 people have died, and 21 of them were children. Other areas also had deaths.

Families went to see the destroyed camp today. People are also asking if there were enough warnings before the floods and if the preparation for the disaster was good. President Trump has now said that this is a major disaster. This means that the government will send help from FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) to Texas.

**White House: Some Countries Might Get More Time for Tariffs**

The deadline for President Trump's special taxes on goods (tariffs) is on July 9th. A White House advisor, Stephen Miran, said that countries that are willing to talk and agree on things might get more time before these taxes start.

But, countries that are not willing to talk or be friendly might have to pay higher taxes. So far, agreements have been made with the UK, China, and Vietnam. Cambodia also says it has an agreement. Mr. Miran hopes more agreements will be made this week.

He said that talks with Europe and India are going well. For example, the agreement with Vietnam is good because the US will put taxes on goods from Vietnam, but Vietnam will not tax goods from the US. President Trump will make his final decisions later this week.

**Sabalenka Reaches Wimbledon Quarter-Finals**

Aryna Sabalenka, the world's top female tennis player, has moved into the Wimbledon quarter-finals. She won her match against Elise Mertens from Belgium very easily, winning in two sets.

Sabalenka, who is from Belarus but is playing without a country flag, has not lost any sets in the tournament yet. She is now the only player from the top six seeds (best players) left in the women's singles.

Sabalenka is 27 years old. She could not play at Wimbledon last year because she was hurt. In 2022, she was not allowed to play because of a ban on players from Russia and Belarus. She will play against Laura Siegemund from Germany in the quarter-finals on July 8th.
