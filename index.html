            <h1>Warsaw Security Forum Focuses on Air Defense; German Defense Minister: Russia is More Dangerous for NATO</h1>
            <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius spoke at the Warsaw Security Forum today. He warned that Russia's threat to NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is growing. He asked member countries to work together more on air defense. He wants them to avoid falling into Russian President Putin's trap of "always making conflicts worse."</p>
            <p>The Warsaw Security Forum is happening in Poland's capital from September 29th to 30th. It is one of the most important meetings for planning strategies in Central and Eastern Europe. This year, the forum is talking about how Europe can make its defense stronger and help Ukraine stay safe for a long time, as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues.</p>
            <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said at the forum today, "Russia is becoming more dangerous for NATO." He explained that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to find NATO's weak points by causing military problems again and again.</p>
            <p>To deal with this situation, NATO needs to show it is united, clear in its actions, and ready to work together. Pistorius promised that Germany will continue to build up its air defense. It will also work more closely with NATO countries to respond to threats from Russia.</p>
            <p>Speaking about Ukraine, Pistorius promised that Germany will keep making its cooperation with Ukraine stronger in the military industry. He believes this is the best way for Germany to keep Ukraine safe right now. Working together on military production will help Ukraine defend itself better. It will also help Ukraine join the European security system faster.</p>
            <p>Before going to the Warsaw Security Forum, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said that Russia flying into NATO airspace is not an accident. He called it "a planned grey zone attack," which is part of "hybrid aggression." Wadephul emphasized that these actions are "very dangerous." Their only goal is "to test NATO's strength."</p>
            <p>Recently, countries in Northern Europe like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have reported that Russian military planes entered their airspace. This has caused a lot of concern. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also asked at the forum today that European countries work together to create a shared air defense system to protect against Russian military threats.</p>

            <h1>Russian Drone Threat: European Expert Warns "Hybrid Warfare Aims to Create Confusion"</h1>
            <p>Today, France announced that it is sending a team to Denmark. This team will help fight against drones to keep the EU summit safe on October 1st and 2nd. Lately, there have been many suspected threats from Russia in Europe. Experts are warning to be careful about hybrid warfare, which uses many different and unclear methods.</p>
            <p>Since September 22nd, many unknown drones have been seen flying over important places in Denmark and Norway, like airports and military bases. The justice department in Denmark and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) have not said where these drones came from. However, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, "One country is a threat to European security, and that is Russia."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Danish Ministry of Transport announced that starting today, civilian drones are not allowed to fly over the country. This is to keep the European Union (EU) summit safe.</p>
            <p>Today, the French Ministry of Defense said it has sent a temporary joint team to Denmark. This team has 35 members, a Fennec helicopter, and anti-drone equipment that is currently in use.</p>
            <p>Many European countries often say that Russia is using hybrid warfare against countries that support Ukraine against Russia. This includes secret actions, digital attacks, or testing military defenses. The goal is to cause problems or test how strong Europe and NATO are.</p>
            <p>According to Franceinfo, Russia's threats to the EU and NATO are growing and changing. In recent weeks, many drones have entered the airspace of Poland, Denmark, and Germany. Also, three Russian planes entered Estonian airspace.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, early this month, France found several pig heads in front of mosques in Paris. Investigators think Russia might be behind this. On September 22nd, Moldovan President Maia Sandu publicly worried about Russia trying to influence Moldova's parliamentary election on September 28th. This happened after authorities found a group trying to cause "violence after the election."</p>
            <p>The report states that Europe is facing a hybrid war from Russia. Ulrich Bounat, an expert from the French think tank "Euro Cr√©ative," explained, "The goal of hybrid warfare is to make the opponent unstable as much as possible, without direct military fighting."</p>
            <p>Thomas Haldenwang, a former head of German intelligence, also told Politico that Russia knows it is "militarily weaker than NATO." Because of this, it "uses all other possible ways, from influencing political discussions to cyberattacks on important infrastructure, and bigÁ†¥Âùè actions."</p>
            <p>Russia has always denied any intentions related to war, and some events cannot be directly linked to Russia. Arsalan Bilal, research head at the Peace Research Center at the Arctic University of Norway, pointed out, "The nature of hybrid warfare is its lack of clarity."</p>
            <p>Bilal also said, "Russia's main goal is to break down Europe from the inside, including the EU and NATO. Russia knows it is hard to win against Europe with a traditional war, so it tries to weaken Europe from the inside."</p>
            <p>Because drones are entering European airspace, some people are asking for more action. For example, French President Emmanuel Macron asked NATO members to respond more strongly when they face such actions during the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
            <p>However, the report mentioned that European countries currently do not have enough equipment to deal with these threats. A missile that can stop a drone can cost hundreds of thousands of Euros.</p>
            <p>Bilal said that when facing hybrid warfare, military action is one part, but it is also important to improve cooperation and work together. "We must fund independent media, and improve media education to fight against Russian propaganda and false information, so everyone can tell when information is being controlled," he said.</p>

            <h1>Pro-European Ruling Party in Moldova Keeps Majority in Parliament; European Leaders Congratulate Them</h1>
            <p>Today, Moldova's ruling party, which supports joining the European Union (EU), announced that they won a small majority in the parliamentary election. This happened even though Russia was accused of trying to influence the election. They described it as a very difficult fight. Leaders from several European countries congratulated them on the result.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Moldova is a country in Eastern Europe next to Ukraine. It has long been divided between wanting to be closer to Europe or to Russia. There is also an area in the country controlled by people who support Russia and want to separate.</p>
            <p>This election was seen as very important for Moldova's plan to join the EU. The country applied to join after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>
            <p>Igor Grosu, the leader of the ruling Action and Solidarity Party (PAS), said in a press conference, "Russia used every bad method to influence the election... This is not just a win for our party, but a win for the people."</p>
            <p>According to Moldova's election committee website, over 99.96% of the votes have been counted. President Maia Sandu's PAS party got 50.17% of the votes. They will now lead the parliament, which has 101 seats. The pro-Russian Patriotic Bloc got 24.18% of the votes.</p>
            <p>The PAS party's vote percentage this time was a bit lower than the 52.8% they got in the 2021 election.</p>
            <p>After the votes were counted yesterday, Sandu told reporters, "The election results strongly support our country joining the EU."</p>
            <p>She also said today that the PAS party winning the parliamentary election "shows that the people of Moldova can unite when the future of their country is in danger."</p>
            <p>Andrei Curararu, an analyst at the Moldovan think tank WatchDog.md, told AFP that the statistics show PAS has definitely won a small majority in parliament. But the danger is not over, because it will still be hard to form a government that works well.</p>
            <p>He added, "The Kremlin put a lot of money into this operation and will not give up. They might try to stop Moldova from forming a stable pro-European government by organizing protests and buying off ruling party members of parliament."</p>
            <p>Antonio Costa, the President of the European Council, said that Moldova chose "a European future." Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk praised Moldova for stopping Russia's plans. France congratulated the Moldovan people for choosing to protect their "independence."</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also congratulated Moldova's pro-European ruling party today for winning the parliamentary election. He stressed that Moscow's attempt to mess up the country's election did not work.</p>
