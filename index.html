After US President Trump announced new 30% tariffs on EU products, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on July 13 that this should not be seen as a "trade war within Western countries." Meloni believes that if Western countries fight each other with trade, it will make them weaker when facing big global problems.

She added that the EU is strong enough to protect itself and make fair trade deals. Italy will do its part. For now, the EU has not reacted to the US tariffs because it wants to reach an agreement with the US. Trump said on July 12 that starting August 1, products from the EU and Mexico sold to the US will have a 30% tax.

After Trump's announcement, opposition parties in Italy criticized Meloni. The leader of the "5 Star Movement" party, Giuseppe Conte, said Meloni was giving in to threats from Washington. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU will not retaliate now. They hope to talk and make a deal so the US does not put 30% tariffs on all EU products.

**To Prevent Hospital Infections, a Taiwanese Team Developed a System to Check Handwashing Less Than 40 Seconds**

A team from the National Health Research Institutes and Taoyuan General Hospital in Taiwan has created a new system to check if medical staff wash their hands properly. This system was featured on the cover of an international journal. It makes sure doctors and nurses clean their hands well at five important times, like before touching patients. It also warns with a red light if someone washes their hands for less than 40 seconds.

In January 2021, Taoyuan General Hospital had Taiwan's first COVID-19 outbreak inside the hospital. It happened because a doctor in the intensive care unit did not wash his hands well after a procedure, which led to many infections.

Deputy Superintendent Cheng Shu-Hsing said that because of this event, the hospital worked with the National Health Research Institutes to make this hand hygiene monitoring system for the intensive care unit. Taoyuan Hospital is where they are testing the system. It helps remind medical staff to wash their hands, which improves how they stop infections in the hospital.

Liao Lun-Te, a deputy director at the National Health Research Institutes, said that infections related to healthcare are common problems for patients. About 20% to 70% of these can be stopped by washing hands. But globally, only about 40% of medical workers follow handwashing rules. Watching staff wash hands can help them follow the rules more, but it takes a lot of people and time.

The system uses passive sensors, not cameras, because nurses were worried about privacy. Liao explained that the system uses Bluetooth to find staff and combines pressure and ultrasound sensors to measure how long and well hands are washed.

Liao said their goal is not to catch people not washing hands, but to help. Medical staff wear a small Bluetooth tracker, like a USB drive, near their ID badge. It does not identify them. The system checks handwashing based on where staff are in the ward, simplifying the World Health Organization's five moments for hand hygiene to "entering the ward" and "leaving the ward."

The system can tell if handwashing is complete. For example, it senses how much hand sanitizer is used. For wet handwashing, it checks if it lasts 40 seconds. If not, a red warning appears. They plan to make the device vibrate to give an immediate reminder.

This hand hygiene system was used in an adult intensive care unit and was 72% accurate. The study was on the cover of the "Global Challenges" journal in December last year. Chen Wei-Chien, another deputy director at the National Health Research Institutes, said this system is important for healthcare, especially with a global shortage of nurses, because it reduces the need for human monitoring and helps nurses with their work.

He pitched 5 innings, striking out 5 batters and allowing no runs. He and three other pitchers together threw a 9-inning perfect game. The Pirates won 4-0, and Chang Hung-Ling got his fifth win of the season.

The Pirates won the game 4-0. Chang Hung-Ling got his fifth win this season, and his ERA is now 5.30. The Pirates' High-A team's official website reported that the team also had a combined perfect game on July 4 against the Baltimore Orioles. Having two 9-inning combined perfect games in nine days is also a historical event.

Taiwanese infielder Lee Hao-Yu from the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A team showed his strong hitting and base running. Today, in a game against the Kansas City Royals' Triple-A team, Lee Hao-Yu started as the leadoff hitter and played third base. He got 2 hits in 3 at-bats and walked twice. He also stole 4 bases. His batting average after the game is .246. His team won 6-1.
