            <h1>France's 2025 Strategic Report: China's Threat to Taiwan Causes Dangerous Instability in the Region</h1>
            <p>The French "National Strategic Assessment" for this year was released on July 14. Russia is clearly the biggest threat in Europe. China is also called a "real strategic challenge." The report mentions many times that Taiwan is threatened. It says that China often does very big military exercises and puts pressure on Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait. It also harms other countries' rights in the South China Sea. This makes the situation in the region unstable.</p>
            <p>The French Ministry of Defense published the newest "National Strategic Assessment 2025." This report was asked for by the head of state. The Ministry of Defense, national security groups, and the Prime Minister's office worked together to look at new possible threats to France's safety and how to deal with them.</p>
            <p>The world situation is getting worse, and there are conflicts in many areas. Before France's National Day on July 14, President Emmanuel Macron said that the defense budget should increase by 3.5 billion Euros (about 121.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars) in 2026. It should increase by another 3 billion Euros in 2027. This is to protect freedom and fight against "imperialist policies" and "forces that take over land." The report being released now is very important.</p>
            <p>Russia is called the biggest threat in Europe. It is showing more and more unfriendliness towards France and its friends through aggressive actions. Not only does the Kremlin have many weapons near Europe, but it also uses nuclear threats, false information, cyber-attacks, spying, holding foreigners, taking over neighboring countries' land, and interfering in elections.</p>
            <p>Besides Russia, the strategic report also calls China a "real strategic challenge." It says that many French overseas areas in the Pacific are targeted by China. For example, the riots in New Caledonia in 2024 might have been influenced by Azerbaijan and China.</p>
            <p>The 2025 National Strategic Assessment says that in the "Melanesia" area (one of the three main island groups in the Pacific), China focuses on influencing actions. It targets New Caledonia's important location and its nickel resources.</p>
            <p>France's strategic assessment also looks at China's threat to Taiwan. The report says China wants to become the world's strongest power by 2050, when the Chinese Communist Party will be 100 years old. This explains why China is doing more and bigger military exercises around Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Defense wrote that in 2024 and 2025, China repeatedly held very large military exercises around Taiwan. This shows that China's military strength is growing quickly. "China might also increase pressure on Taiwan using non-military methods. The situation in the region is especially dangerous and unstable because it's not clear how much security the U.S. will provide to its Asian friends and partners."</p>
            <p>China continues to use a "fait accompli" policy in the South China Sea. It changes the current situation to harm other countries' rights. It is also quickly developing a strategy that combines military and civilian uses in traditional weapons and nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>The report shows that China is increasing its nuclear weapons. It is the only country among the permanent members of the UN Security Council and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty countries that has not said it will stop making fissile material (material for nuclear weapons).</p>
            <p>China continues to improve its missile abilities. Last year, it tested ballistic missiles 310 times. It also launched an intercontinental ballistic missile from Hainan into the Pacific. This missile is said to have a range of 12,000 kilometers. This mainly sends a strategic message to Taiwan and the United States.</p>
            <p>The report also points out Taiwan's important economic and technological role. It stresses that trade and safety issues are now linked together. "Because we rely on others for strategic goods, we must now think about the global economic risks that any future conflict could cause. For example, Taiwan is a key part of the semiconductor supply chain."</p>
            <p>The French military says that Beijing's defense technology is developing quickly in areas like quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and space. "To grow, it is using new mixed actions, including cyber actions, and taking scientific and technological ideas from others."</p>
            <p>Also, China has military forces in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Through economic connections and diplomatic ways, it achieves an uneven "clientelism" (a system where one party gives support in exchange for loyalty). This helps Beijing's interests and tries to "change the global governance order."</p>
            <p>The report also mentions China's alliance with Russia. It says this "directly makes Russia stronger in the Russia-Ukraine war." (Beijing)'s military cooperation with Russia continues to grow. China sees Russia as an important long-term strategic friend and forms a common front with it.</p>
            <p>The report also looked at other national and international security risks, such as immigration, global warming, getting strategic raw materials, and uncertainty in relations with the U.S.</p>
            <p>The second main part of the strategic report focuses on goals for 2030 and 11 big plans to deal with challenges. These include having a stronger and more trusted nuclear deterrent, preparing the whole country to face crises, getting the economy ready for war, being strong against cyber-attacks, dealing with mixed threats, making decisions for military actions, and improving technology and academics to make France more independent.</p>
            <p>It also suggests creating a "voluntary military service system." This would let French adults get basic military training to build a reserve force that can be called up in a crisis. This idea has caused a lot of discussion.</p>

            <h1>Self-Taught Full-Time Creator Chases Dream: Shindo Yoshuhiko Invests in Equipment for Efficiency</h1>
            <p>Shindo Yoshuhiko, who is half Taiwanese and half Japanese, started using YouTube when he was in fifth grade. He taught himself and chased his dream to become a full-time creator. For the past six years, he has worked alone and updated his channel every week. His channel now has over 370,000 subscribers. He thinks being a YouTuber is busy, but it allows him to show his own style. When he works alone, he needs to feel confident in his equipment to work better.</p>
            <p>Shindo Yoshuhiko's YouTube channel has many different types of videos. They include daily life, vlogs, travel, couple Q&A, and shopping for luxury items and daily necessities. He has made over 300 videos, and his channel has 375,000 subscribers. Today, Apple invited him to share his experiences and challenges in creating videos with the media.</p>
            <p>Thinking back to how he became a full-time creator, Shindo Yoshuhiko said he started watching YouTube when he was in fifth grade. He got ideas and inspiration from other creators' videos. In his second year of high school, he loved dancing and wanted to make dance videos. He visited a professional video studio. Even though it was too expensive for him, it helped him learn video skills by himself.</p>
            <p>Shindo Yoshuhiko loves photography. At first, he used a MacBook Air laptop and iMovie software to edit videos. When he had problems, he looked for solutions on YouTube. He slowly learned skills and ideas. He only started working as a full-time professional and taking on commercial projects after his channel got more than 100,000 subscribers. He also upgraded his equipment to a MacBook Pro and Final Cut Pro software.</p>
            <p>Besides Apple laptops, Shindo Yoshuhiko's main computer for editing is a Mac Studio desktop computer with an M2 Max chip. It works well even when he adds many audio tracks. This gives him a lot of confidence.</p>
            <p>If he needs to work abroad, he thinks about how much work he has. He chooses to bring a Mac mini with an M4 chip or a MacBook Air with an M4 chip. Sometimes he also brings an M4 iPad Pro, with the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard. This makes it easy for him to draw rough storyboard ideas anytime.</p>
            <p>Shindo Yoshuhiko pointed out, "When you create alone, your equipment is like your assistant. You must feel confident in your equipment to work." If the equipment works well enough, it can really save time.</p>
            <p>When asked for advice for people who want to become full-time creators in the future, Shindo Yoshuhiko said they need to be mentally ready because the work can be very busy. The most important thing is to take the first step. "If you don't take the first step, there won't be a next step." Even if the first videos don't get many views, it's okay. You can try topics that many people like to first attract viewers to your channel. Then, slowly find your own unique style to keep loyal fans.</p>

            <h1>Harry Potter Comes to the Small Screen; Series to Premiere in 2027</h1>
            <p>The TV series based on the fantasy books "Harry Potter" has officially started filming. It is expected to premiere in 2027. The story, which was also made into popular Hollywood movies, will be seen by viewers as a TV series for the first time.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden in the UK said today that the TV series is based on the popular "Harry Potter" book series. These books also led to popular movies and stage plays. The series is currently being filmed at this studio.</p>
            <p>The main story is about a boy, Harry Potter, who goes from the normal "Muggle" world into the magic world. He fights against dark forces with his best friends Ron and Hermione.</p>
            <p>The series will be available on the HBO Max streaming platform. However, the exact release date has not been announced yet.</p>
            <p>This series will have a new cast of actors, different from the movies. It is expected to be a "ten-year long TV series." The original author, J. K. Rowling, is an executive producer.</p>
            <p>The new actors include Dominic McLaughlin as Harry Potter, Arabella Stanton as Hermione, and Alastair Stout as Ron.</p>
            <p>Older, well-known actors will also be in the show. John Lithgow will play Principal Dumbledore, Paapa Essiedu will play Potions Professor Severus Snape, and Nick Frost will play the school's groundskeeper, Rubeus Hagrid.</p>
            <p>In recent years, J. K. Rowling has been accused of being "transphobic" because she said that "biological sex is more important than gender identity" when talking about transgender women. However, she has denied these accusations.</p>
