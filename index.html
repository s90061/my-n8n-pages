            <h1>Trump Says America Wants to Help China, Not Hurt It</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., October 12) A few days after saying he would put a 100% tax on goods from China, the world's second-biggest economy, former US President Trump said today that America "wants to help China, not hurt it." This shows a softer view.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump posted on his social media platform, "Truth Social," saying: "America wants to help China, not hurt it!" He also said that "respected President Xi (Jinping)... does not want his country to have a bad economy."</p>
            <p>On October 10, Trump said that starting November 1, he would add more taxes on China. This is because China put new and very strict limits on sending out rare earth minerals.</p>

            <h1>US Secretary of State Says China Must Free Church Leaders After Many Arrests</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., October 12) Today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke against China. He criticized China for recently arresting many leaders of the Zion Church in Beijing. This is one of Beijing's biggest unofficial churches. Rubio called these arrests "unfriendly actions against Christians."</p>
            <p>Newsmax, a conservative news outlet in the US, reported, using information from The Wall Street Journal, that over 20 people from the Zion Church have been arrested or are missing. For many years, the Zion Church was able to operate quite freely.</p>
            <p>Rubio said in a statement: "We ask the Chinese Communist Party to let the church leaders go free right away. We also ask them to let all people of faith, including those in house churches, practice their religion without fear of punishment."</p>
            <p>Since October 9, about 30 pastors and members of the Zion Church have been taken away by the police.</p>
            <p>According to China Aid, police raided the home of Jin Mingri, the main pastor of Beijing's Zion Church, in the early morning of October 10. People who know about the situation said that the police mainly questioned three pastors: Jin Mingri, Wang Lin, and Yin Huibin. The police were trying to find evidence in their daily lives and church activities to start a case against them. The charges they might face include "illegally using information networks," "illegal business operations," and "fraud."</p>
            <p>Since October 9, the Zion Church has released statements for three days in a row. They ask the Chinese government to stop arresting, threatening, and bothering their church and house churches across the country. They also demand the immediate and unconditional release of all arrested and missing pastors and followers. They want the government to protect the basic right of citizens to believe in any religion, as the law says.</p>
            <p>The report said that the Zion Church started in 2007. It is an unregistered house church. Its influence reaches over 40 cities in China, and about 5,000 people attend its Sunday services. In 2019, the main church in Beijing was forced to close. Pastor Jin Mingri was put on a "border control" list, which meant he could not leave the country to be with his family. Since the start of this year, branches of the Zion Church in many cities across the country have been investigated, and people have been questioned.</p>
