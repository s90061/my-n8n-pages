            <h1>Taipei Metro Wenhu Line has problems; trains are 10 minutes apart between Jiannan Road and Zhongshan Junior High.</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation said today that there is a problem with a train on the Wenhu Line, between Dazhi Station and Taipei Zoo. This is making trains run slower. So, trains between Jiannan Road Station and Zhongshan Junior High School Station will come every 10 minutes on average.</p>
            <p>Taipei Metro also said that trains will stop longer at stations, and people will have to wait longer. If you are in a hurry, you can take other transportation or change lines at other stations. If you have questions about tickets or refunds, you can ask at the information desk or check the official website.</p>

            <h1>Weather Expert Wu Der-rong Says South and Central Taiwan Will Have Heavy Rain; Sunny and Hot Weather by August 6.</h1>
            <p>Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that the southwest monsoon started today in Taiwan. This means central and southern Taiwan will have many days of rain, and some of it could cause damage. He thinks that by August 6, the Pacific high-pressure system will get stronger. The southwest monsoon will move north. Then, sunny and hot summer weather will return.</p>
            <p>According to the weather agency's website, from yesterday until 8 AM today, Taibao Township in Chiayi County received the most rain, with 477 millimeters. Houbi District in Tainan City had 433 millimeters, and Shuiling Township in Yunlin County had 409.5 millimeters.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, who is also a professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column today that the newest European weather model shows the "southwest monsoon" moving near Taiwan from today until August 4. This will bring many days of rain to central and southern Taiwan, which could cause a lot of damage. The air will be unstable, with local showers or thunderstorms. In the afternoon, the affected areas will get bigger. There is also a chance of small areas having "severe weather," like lightning, strong winds, and very heavy rain that comes quickly.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also said that the eastern part of Taiwan, which is on the other side of the mountains, will be less affected. It might have some short rain, but when it doesn't rain, the weather will be hot and humid.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong stated that the latest European model shows the Pacific high-pressure system getting stronger on August 6. The "southwest monsoon" will get weaker and move north. The long period of heavy rain will change, and clear, hot summer weather will come back.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that the newest "Typhoon Probability Map" from the weather agency shows that "Typhoon Zhujiecao" is inside the monsoon system. It is moving towards Zhejiang and then will turn north to Jiangsu. It will not affect Taiwan. "Typhoon Krovanh" is still over the sea south of Japan, moving north. It is very far from Taiwan and will also not affect Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>Markets are Waiting for US Tech Company Reports; Experts Say Taiwan Stock Market Might Get Stronger.</h1>
            <p>On July 28, most US stocks went up. This happened after US President Trump and the European Union made a deal about taxes on goods. This gave hope that the US and China might continue their trade peace. Financial experts said that the main thing affecting Taiwan's stock market lately is the tax rates on goods between the US and Taiwan. However, this week big tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple will announce their financial results. People hope these reports will help the Taiwan stock market.</p>
            <p>KGI Securities said that on July 28, the Taiwan stock market started high in the morning, reaching a new high for this period. But people were careful and watched the market closely. The total money traded was only NT$312.8 billion. After going up, the market pulled back a little and ended with a small drop. From a technical view, it stayed above its short-term average, meaning the Taiwan stock market is still strong. Because the US-Taiwan tax rates might be announced this week, the market might stay quiet before that.</p>
            <p>Most US stocks closed higher on July 28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a small 64.36 points, or 0.14%, to 44837.56 points. The S&P 500 index went up a little, 1.13 points, or 0.02%, to 6389.77 points. The Nasdaq index rose 70.27 points, or 0.33%, to 21178.59 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up 91.24 points, or 1.62%, to 5737.1 points.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market went up 48.6 points on July 28, closing at 23412.98 points. The total money traded was NT$312.841 billion. The three main types of investors bought a total of NT$13.533 billion more than they sold. Among them, dealers bought NT$5.324 billion more, investment trusts bought NT$3.534 billion more, and foreign and Chinese investors bought NT$4.675 billion more.</p>
            <p>Looking at the top 10 stocks that foreign investors bought, Taiwan Glass was first, with 29,300 shares bought. Innolux was second, with 15,800 shares bought. After them were Wistron, AU Optronics, Fubon Vietnam ETF, E.SUN Financial, Yuanta Taiwan Dividend Plus, CTBC Financial, Unimicron, and China Petrochemical Development.</p>
            <p>For the top 10 stocks that foreign investors sold, Taishin Synthetic was sold the most, with 64,000 shares. Taishin Financial Holding was also sold a lot, with 63,700 shares. After them were Dacheng Steel, Chang Hwa Bank, Mega Financial Holding, Taiwan Chemical Fibre, CSBC Corporation, Yuanta Taiwan 50 Inverse 1, First Financial Holding, and Capital Securities Taiwan High Dividend.</p>
