            <h1>Israel Attacks Doha; UK, France, Germany Condemn It</h1>
            <p>London, September 9 (Central News Agency) - On September 9, the UK, France, and Germany spoke out against Israel's recent air attack in Doha. This attack targeted the political leaders of Hamas, a Palestinian armed group. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, responded indirectly to their criticism.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that this attack broke Qatar's right to control its own land. He also said it could make the situation in the Middle East "worse." French President Emmanuel Macron stated that this kind of action is "unacceptable," no matter the reason.</p>
            <p>Starmer wrote on social media platform X: "I do not agree with Israel's attack on Doha... The most important things now are a quick ceasefire, letting the hostages go, and sending a lot of help to Gaza. This is the only way to get lasting peace."</p>
            <p>Macron also criticized the attack on the same platform. He said, "We must not let the fighting spread in that area."</p>
            <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said in a statement: "Israel's attack on Doha not only violated Qatar's control over its own land, but it also put at risk all our efforts to free the hostages. This attack cannot be accepted."</p>
            <p>This was the first time Israel carried out an air attack on Doha, the capital of Qatar. Qatar's Ministry of Interior reported that one member of their local security forces died.</p>
            <p>At the same time, a Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the son of Hamas's main negotiator died in the attack, but the top leaders were safe.</p>
            <p>In response to the criticism from European countries, Netanyahu said that the critics had forgotten about Hamas's deadly attack on Israel in October 2023.</p>
            <p>He said: "Many countries around the world, including the governments of many democratic countries, have shamefully forgotten October 7th. But I will not forget, and Israel will never forget."</p>

            <h1>US Job Numbers Down by 911,000; White House Pushes Federal Reserve to Lower Interest Rates</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 9 (Central News Agency) - The US government announced today that job growth was much lower than previously reported in the year leading up to March. This bad job data made the White House ask the US Federal Reserve (Fed) again to lower interest rates. The Fed will have a meeting about its policies next week.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, the US Department of Labor released early numbers. These numbers show that the US might have had 911,000 fewer new jobs than thought in the year up to March.</p>
            <p>On average, about 76,000 fewer jobs were added each month. This time period includes the last few months of former President Biden's term and the start of President Trump's second term. This kind of change is a normal yearly process for the government. The final numbers will be released early next year.</p>
            <p>But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt used these numbers to say that the economy under the previous government was "a mess." She then told the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, to lower interest rates right away.</p>
            <p>She also criticized the job numbers and changes from the Department of Labor Statistics. She said this shows there is a need for "new leadership."</p>
            <p>Before these new estimates, US government information showed that employers had added nearly 1.8 million jobs in the past year.</p>
            <p>The first reduction is bigger than last year's reduction of 818,000 jobs. At that time, this number made Trump very angry before the presidential election in November. Trump then said that the Biden government was changing the job numbers and called it "a big scandal."</p>

            <h1>Hsing-Ta Power Plant Fire: 6 Village Chiefs in Yong'an Demand Shutdown and Full Investigation; May Block Plant</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung, September 10 (Central News Agency) - There was a fire at the Hsing-Ta Power Plant in Kaohsiung last night. The sounds of explosions scared many local people. Six village chiefs from Yong'an district came to see what happened and released a joint statement. They said that Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) should explain things publicly and stop the plant's operations for a full check. If not, they might block the plant as a protest.</p>
            <p>Ho Ying-cheng, the chief of Hsin-kang Village, told reporters that the six village chiefs waited from about 8 PM until 11 PM but Taipower did not explain anything to them. "Taipower explained to the media but did not answer the village chiefs. This is really bad," he said.</p>
            <p>The fire at Hsing-Ta Power Plant happened around 8 PM on September 9. The machine unit that had the accident was a new one and was being tested. The cause of the accident is still being looked into.</p>
            <p>After the accident, six village chiefs from Yong'an district, including Ho Ying-cheng, Kuo Hsien-ming (Yong'an Village chief), Lin Ming-chun (Yonghua Village chief), Chen Wen-yin (Pao-ning Village chief), Chiang Fu-shan (Wei-hsin Village chief), and Ko Nan-lieh (Yen-tien Village chief), all came to check on the situation. At around 11 PM, the six people released a joint statement. They asked Taipower to come to the Yong'an District Office on the morning of September 10 to publicly explain the reason for the accident.</p>
            <p>"Even 5 kilometers away, doors were shaking," Ho Ying-cheng said. He added that the accident has made people scared. He believes the plant must stop operating until the real reason for this accident is clear. He also said that the plant should not start again until it is completely safe. He also asked the city government to be strong and not let residents live in fear.</p>
            <p>Chiang Fu-shan said that Taipower did not tell local residents when they did the first test run. "The first test had some strange smell, and when we told Taipower, they said it was because of new paint," he said.</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-yin said that the government's energy plans must keep local residents safe. Local residents should not be put at risk. He also said that the plant must be checked for safety before it can operate again. "Yong'an district helps with electricity, and local people want more than just benefits. They also want to live safely," he said.</p>
