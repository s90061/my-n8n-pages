            <h1>After Hyundai Raid, Border Czar: US Immigration Enforcement Will Target More Companies</h1>
            <p>After the US government recently raided a Hyundai facility in Georgia and arrested hundreds of people, a high-ranking White House official said today that immigration enforcement will increase for more companies in the future.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Tom Homan, who is in charge of border issues at the White House, said on CNN's "State of the Union" program that the government will now focus on checking workplaces for immigration violations.</p>
            <p>Homan said, "We will do more enforcement in workplaces. No one hires people who are not legally allowed to work out of kindness. They hire them because these people can do harder work, get paid less, and this makes it harder for companies that hire American citizens to compete."</p>
            <p>People who do not agree with Trump's strong immigration rules and some business groups say that important American industries, like farming, hotels, and meat processing, depend on workers who do not have legal status in the US.</p>
            <p>On September 4, US immigration officials raided a Hyundai facility. They arrested 475 people, mostly from Korea, for breaking immigration laws. The Korean government said today that these workers will go back to their home country after completing the necessary official steps.</p>

            <h1>Trump Gives "Last Warning" to Hamas, Urging Them to Release Hostages</h1>
            <p>US President Trump today gave what he called a "final warning" to Hamas, an Islamic group from Palestine. He asked this armed group to agree to a deal to free hostages from Gaza.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social: "Israel has agreed to my terms, and now it is time for Hamas to accept them too. I have warned Hamas about what will happen if they do not accept. This is my last warning, there will not be another one!"</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Israeli N12 News said that Trump had offered a new plan for a ceasefire, which means stopping the fighting.</p>
            <p>According to N12, this agreement includes Hamas releasing all 48 hostages they are still holding on the first day of the ceasefire. In return, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian prisoners. During the ceasefire, both sides would talk about how to end the war.</p>
            <p>An official from Israel said that Israel is "seriously thinking about" Trump's plan, but they did not share many details.</p>

            <h1>Trump Attends US Open by Rolex's Invitation, Despite High Tariffs on Switzerland</h1>
            <p>US President Trump went to the men's singles final at the U.S. Open tennis tournament today. He was invited by Rolex, a luxury watch company from Switzerland. This happened even though he had greatly increased taxes on goods from Switzerland in early August.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that since Trump returned to the White House, his schedule in the US has often included big sports events. He has not traveled much to announce new policies or give speeches at large gatherings, which he liked to do during his campaign.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump will watch the match from Rolex's special guest area. The players are Jannik Sinner, the 24-year-old Italian champion, and Carlos Alcaraz, the 22-year-old Spanish player who is seeded second in the tournament.</p>
            <p>Just a few weeks before, Trump's government put very high taxes, up to 39%, on Swiss goods. This tax rate is more than two and a half times higher than what the US agreed to with the European Union (EU). It is also nearly four times higher than the rate for the UK. This made people wonder if Switzerland could still compete with the 27 countries in the EU that are its neighbors.</p>
            <p>The White House did not want to comment on Trump accepting an invitation from a company to attend the US Open. However, Trump has often mixed his decisions about politics or foreign policy with making more money for his family's businesses.</p>
