            <h1>Taiwan Nichia Company Promotes Dai Zhen-jia to Senior Managing Director, Making Him the Highest-Ranking Taiwanese Manager</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Nichia (Nichia) announced today that Mr. Dai Zhen-jia, who is currently a managing director, has been promoted. He is now a Senior Managing Director. This makes him the Taiwanese manager with the highest position in the Nichia group. Mr. Dai Zhen-jia is now the third most important person at Taiwan Nichia, after the President and Vice President.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Nichia explained in a press release that the position of Senior Managing Director is very important in Japanese companies. It is only below the President and Vice President. This person is in charge of the main business operations and making big plans. They also play a very important role in board meetings and regular meetings. This new appointment shows that Nichia highly values Mr. Dai Zhen-jia's leadership and hard work over many years.</p>
            <p>Besides his role at Nichia, Mr. Dai Zhen-jia also works as the Vice Chairman of Taya Semiconductor. Taya Semiconductor is a company owned by Nichia. This shows a deeper plan to combine businesses in the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li Guo-guang, the Chairman of Taya, said that a high-level Taiwanese manager being promoted to Senior Managing Director in a Japanese company is very special in the history of Japanese business. It shows that skilled people from Taiwan are very competitive in international companies. It also means that the economic and cultural trust between Taiwan and Japan is growing stronger.</p>
            <p>A "Senior Managing Director" is similar to an Executive Director in Taiwanese companies. In Japanese companies, this person often helps the President and manages all company matters.</p>

            <h1>Woman in New Taipei Beats Her Partner to Death and Burned Her Face; She Also Hurt Her Four Years Ago</h1>
            <p>In February this year, a woman named Luo from New Taipei City used a pool cue to hit her girlfriend's head and a lighter to burn her face. This caused her girlfriend's death. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office has charged Ms. Luo with causing death by injury. Ms. Luo admitted to all the charges in court. It was found that Ms. Luo had also hurt Ms. Qiu four years ago, so this was not the first time she was violent.</p>
            <p>Ms. Luo, who is 34 years old, and Ms. Qiu were partners. They lived together in a rented apartment in Xinzhuang District, New Taipei City. Around 1 AM on February 4th this year, Ms. Luo first pushed Ms. Qiu with her hands, causing Ms. Qiu's head to hit the ground. After Ms. Qiu lost consciousness, Ms. Luo moved her to the bed, but Ms. Qiu's head hit something again.</p>
            <p>Ms. Luo also used a pool cue to hit Ms. Qiu's head and body. Then, she used a lighter to set fire to tissues and other things that burn easily. She burned Ms. Qiu's face, head, and shoulders. This caused a lot of bleeding at the back of Ms. Qiu's head and a broken bone (left occipital bone). In the end, Ms. Qiu died from brain damage.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office recently charged Ms. Luo with causing death by injury. The New Taipei District Court held a preparatory hearing yesterday, and Ms. Luo admitted to all the crimes mentioned.</p>
            <p>Also, it was found that Ms. Luo had hurt Ms. Qiu many years ago. In February 2021, the two argued. Ms. Luo used a wine bottle and an ashtray to hit Ms. Qiu. She also grabbed Ms. Qiu's head and hit it against a wall. This caused injuries to Ms. Qiu's head. At that time, the prosecutor charged Ms. Luo with assault. However, they reached an agreement, and the charges were dropped.</p>
