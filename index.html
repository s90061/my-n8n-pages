            <h1>U12 Baseball World Cup: Hu Cheng-en Shows His Batting Power, Still Aims for 30 Stolen Bases</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 28, CNA) The Taiwan team won against Germany 17-0 today in the U12 Baseball World Cup. This is their third win in the first round, and they have a good chance to move forward in the competition. Hu Cheng-en, who had said he wanted to get 30 stolen bases, hit two home runs in this game and got 5 RBIs (runs batted in). The head coach called him a "key player." But Hu said he still wants to reach his goal for stolen bases.</p>
            <p>The U12 Baseball World Cup is happening at the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center. The Taiwan team won against Cuba and Australia first. Yesterday, they lost to Japan. Today, they played against Germany. In the first part of the game, Hu Cheng-en hit a solo home run. This was the first home run for the Taiwan team in this competition. In the fourth part of the game, he hit another home run with the bases loaded.</p>
            <p>Hu Cheng-en got on base every time he batted (4 times). He hit 3 extra-base hits: two home runs and one double. He helped his team score 5 runs. Taiwan team's head coach, Chang Tzu-chien, said in a TV interview that Hu Cheng-en is a very important player. When he plays well, it makes the team feel good and have high spirits. If he can keep playing this way, it will help a lot in the games to come.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Taiwan team lost to Japan for the first time, and the players were sad and cried. Coach Chang said that when they got back to the hotel, he talked to the players again. He told them not to feel defeated because of the loss. He said the competition is still going on, and there is still hope. He also said they might play against Japan again later. He told them to play freely in the next games because "tomorrow is a new day."</p>
            <p>Hu Cheng-en had said before in an interview that he wanted to get 30 stolen bases and also win a batting award. Today, he showed his hitting power first. He said that when he went to bat in the first part of the game, he felt calm. He tried to stay calm and hit the ball where he wanted to.</p>
            <p>When he was asked if he still wanted to get 30 stolen bases since he is so good at hitting for power, Hu Cheng-en said that he needs to get hits to steal 30 bases. He also said that hitting home runs happens at important times if he can stay calm and relaxed. He said his goal of 30 stolen bases has not changed.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Finance Plans to Change Law: Spouses Must Still Pay Tax on Deemed Inheritance, Even if They Give Up Their Right to Inherit</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 28, CNA) In October last year, the Constitutional Court said that some parts of the inheritance and gift tax law were against the constitution. Today, the Ministry of Finance announced new guidelines for how to handle these taxes. These rules say that tax bills can now be sent separately for "deemed inheritance" and "non-deemed inheritance." This is to stop people who don't actually get the "deemed inheritance" from having to pay tax on it.</p>
            <p>The guidelines from the Ministry of Finance are temporary rules until the law is changed. In the future, the law will clearly state that even if a person gives up their right to inherit, they still have to pay the inheritance tax that comes from "deemed inheritance."</p>
            <p>If a person gives property to their spouse within two years before they die, this property is considered part of their estate (called "deemed inheritance") when they die. This "deemed inheritance" is then added to the total amount of their estate for tax purposes.</p>
            <p>For example, a man gave a large amount of stocks to his wife within two years before he died. But after he died, his wife and children decided to give up their right to inherit. This meant that the only person who inherited, the man's daughter from outside of marriage, had to pay all the inheritance tax, even though she did not get the stocks. The tax amount was over 57.35 million NT dollars. On October 28 last year, the Constitutional Court made a decision (113 Constitutional Judgment No. 11) that part of Article 15, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 1 of the Inheritance and Gift Tax Act was against the constitution. The government needs to change the law within two years.</p>
            <p>The problem in this case was that the husband had given a large amount of stocks to his wife within two years before he died. So, this gift was still seen as part of his estate and was added to the total estate for tax. But his wife and children gave up their right to inherit after he died. This meant that his daughter from outside of marriage, who was the only heir, had to pay all the inheritance tax, even though she did not get the large amount of stocks.</p>
            <p>To fix this problem, the Ministry of Finance has created temporary guidelines before the law is changed. Today, they set up the "Principles for Handling Inheritance Tax on Property Given to a Spouse Within 2 Years Before Death and Included in the Total Estate." These rules are active starting today. They apply to cases that happened from October 28, 2024, until the new inheritance and gift tax law becomes active. This includes cases that have happened but have not been taxed yet, cases that are being appealed or have not been paid yet, and future inheritance cases. Right now, there are about 100 cases that involve "deemed inheritance" to a spouse.</p>
            <p>Officials explained that the current tax law usually sends one tax bill for one inheritance case. The new temporary rules say that separate tax bills can be sent for "deemed inheritance" and "non-deemed inheritance." For example, if the total estate is 65 million NT dollars (this includes 5 million NT dollars of "deemed inheritance" given to the spouse), and the total inheritance tax is 2.75 million NT dollars, then the tax for the "deemed inheritance" part would be 210,000 NT dollars (2.75 million NT dollars multiplied by the part that 5 million NT dollars is of 65 million NT dollars). This part of the tax should be sent to the spouse. The tax for the "non-deemed inheritance" part would be 2.54 million NT dollars (2.75 million NT dollars multiplied by the part that 60 million NT dollars is of 65 million NT dollars). This part should be sent to all heirs, including the spouse.</p>
            <p>Because of this new temporary rule, the deceased man's daughter from outside of marriage will not have to pay the inheritance tax that comes from the large amount of stocks her father gave to his wife. She will only need to pay the tax for the part of the estate she actually inherits.</p>
            <p>Officials said that to make sure people are treated fairly and property rights are protected, and to have fair taxes, they are quickly working on a new law based on the court's decision. In the future, the law will state that no matter if the spouse gives up their right to inherit or not, the National Tax Administration can still send them a tax bill for the "deemed inheritance." The exact details of the new law are still being discussed.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the temporary rules also say that when people list the "right to claim the difference in remaining property of spouses" as a deduction, "deemed inheritance" can be included when calculating this. This means that the amount that can be deducted will increase, which may lead to lower taxes.</p>
            <p>According to the law, when the legal marriage property system ends (for example, when a spouse dies), if one spouse has "property acquired after marriage" remaining after paying any debts from the marriage, the difference in the remaining property between the two spouses should be divided equally. So, after a person dies, the living spouse can use their right to claim the difference in remaining property. The value of this claim can be taken out of the total estate when the inheritance tax is calculated.</p>
