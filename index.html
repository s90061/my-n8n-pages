https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240521-the-rise-of-the-third-place-where-people-meet-outside-home-and-work

People often talk about home as the "first place" and work or school as the "second place." But there's another important type of location known as a "third place." These are social spaces that are not your home or your workplace, where you can relax, meet people, and feel part of a community. Think of places like local cafes, public libraries, community centers, parks, or even gyms.

These "third places" are becoming more and more important in our daily lives. After difficult periods like the pandemic, many people are looking for ways to connect with others and reduce feelings of loneliness. These spaces offer a chance to build real friendships and support networks that online interactions sometimes can't provide. They help people feel a sense of belonging.

For example, a local coffee shop might be where you catch up with friends, or a community garden might be where you meet new neighbours who share your interests. Even barbershops or small bookshops can act as important "third places" where people chat and connect. These relaxed environments are vital for our mental well-being and for creating stronger, happier communities.

**Companies still want to hire, but finding skilled workers is a problem**

https://www.reuters.com/business/global-hiring-plans-remain-stable-employers-worried-about-skills-shortages-manpowergroup-2024-05-28/

A new survey shows that companies around the world plan to hire about the same number of people in the next few months as they did recently. This means that, in general, employers are still looking for new staff. However, there's a big problem: most companies are finding it very hard to find people with the right skills for the jobs they need to fill.

About three out of four employers say they are struggling to find skilled workers. This issue is called a "skills gap," and it's a major worry for businesses. They especially need people with knowledge in areas like technology, data analysis, and skills related to protecting the environment. Even though companies want to expand their teams, they are having trouble finding the right talent.

To solve this, many businesses are now investing money in training their current employees. They are teaching their staff new skills so they can meet the demands of the job market. Companies are also trying harder to keep their best employees, as it's becoming more difficult to replace them. This trend shows that having the right skills is more important than ever for finding and keeping a job.

**Are 'sleep holidays' the new travel trend this summer?**

https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/jun/01/is-this-the-summer-of-the-sleep-tourism-holiday

A new type of holiday, called "sleep tourism," is becoming popular. This trend is for people who travel specifically to improve their sleep. Instead of just sightseeing, travellers are choosing trips that help them rest better and feel more refreshed. This can mean staying in special hotels, taking part in workshops about sleep, or using new technology designed to help you sleep well.

This trend is growing because more people understand how important good sleep is for their health and feeling well. After recent stressful times, many are looking for ways to relax deeply. Luxury hotels are now offering special services like "sleep menus," which might include different types of pillows, relaxing teas, or calming music. They are also making rooms extra dark and quiet, and some even have experts who can teach you how to sleep better.

While it might seem unusual, these "sleep holidays" are for those who want a truly relaxing break. It's a growing part of the travel industry that aims to help people get the rest they need to feel their best. So, this summer, instead of just exploring new places, some people might be travelling to get a perfect night's sleep.`;
