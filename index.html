https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vgq7j84lpo

Smart computer programs, known as Artificial Intelligence (AI), are becoming much more common in our daily lives. They are especially changing how we find information and make choices. For example, when you watch movies online, listen to music, or shop on the internet, AI is often working behind the scenes. It learns what you like and then suggests new things you might enjoy. This means that AI is helping to personalize what we see and hear. It can show us news articles, videos, or products that fit our interests. This technology is making our digital experiences more suited to each person, but it also means AI has a big role in what information we get every day.

Many companies are still trying to find the best way for their employees to work. After the pandemic, a lot of people started working from home. Now, some businesses want everyone to come back to the office full-time. However, many others are choosing a "hybrid" model. This means employees work some days in the office and some days remotely from home. Research shows that more workers are choosing to work remotely, especially if it helps them save money on things like travel. Companies are trying to balance offering flexibility to employees with the need for teamwork and new ideas that often happen when people work together in person. Finding the right balance for work is still a big discussion for businesses worldwide.

**Battling Overtourism: Popular Spots Seek Solutions**
https://www.cnn.com/travel/what-is-overtourism-and-can-anything-be-done-about-it/index.html

Some of the world's most famous and beautiful places are facing a problem called "overtourism." This happens when too many visitors come to a place at once. When there are too many tourists, it can harm the environment, make life difficult for the local people, and even damage historical sites. For example, cities like Venice and Amsterdam are struggling with very large crowds. To solve this, many cities and countries are looking for new ideas. They are trying to promote "sustainable tourism," which means travel that is good for the environment and the local community. Some solutions include charging entry fees, limiting the number of daily visitors, or encouraging people to visit during less busy times or explore less-known areas. The goal is to protect these special places for future generations while still allowing people to experience them.`;
