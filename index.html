            <h1>Nanya Tech and Etron Tech Work Together with NT$500 Million to Create Chip Design Company for AI Memory</h1>
            <p>Nanya Technology, a company that makes memory chips, announced today that it will work together with Etron Technology. They will start a new company that designs computer chips. Nanya Technology will invest up to 40 million shares, which is not more than 400 million New Taiwan Dollars. They will own up to 80% of the new company.</p>
            <p>Nanya Technology said that the goal of working together is to make special very fast memory chips, called HBM, faster. This will help them find more business chances in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market.</p>
            <p>Etron Technology also announced that its company and its smaller company, e-Design, have signed an agreement to work with Nanya Technology. e-Design and Nanya Technology will invest 500 million New Taiwan Dollars together in the new company. Etron Technology will own 20% and Nanya Technology will own 80%.</p>
            <p>Etron Technology said that they are working with Nanya Technology to meet the fast growth of the new AI edge computing market. They want to offer special very fast memory solutions that are valuable, work very well, and use little power. This will help them find many different business chances in AI edge computing.</p>
            <p>Etron Technology stated that offering these special very fast memory solutions through the new company will be good for the people who own shares in the company.</p>
            <p>Nanya Technology said in a meeting in early July that AI-related very fast memory products started to become more expensive in 2024. Markets for non-AI uses are about 90% of the whole memory market. In June this year, the market had enough supply and demand, and prices started to go up. They think prices will keep rising until the second half of the year.</p>

            <h1>EU Monitoring Group: World Had 3rd Hottest July on Record</h1>
            <p>Scientists from Europe's climate monitoring group, "Copernicus Climate Change Service," said today that July this year was the third hottest July ever recorded around the world. During this time, Turkey had a temperature of 50.5 degrees Celsius. This was the highest temperature ever recorded in Turkey.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that even though record high temperatures paused for a short time, July this year still continued the trend of extreme weather. Scientists say this is because of global warming caused by people.</p>
            <p>According to the European Union's (EU) climate monitoring group, "Copernicus Climate Change Service" (C3S), the average air temperature on Earth's surface in July this year was 16.68 degrees Celsius. This is 0.45 degrees Celsius higher than the average for the same period from 1991 to 2020.</p>
            <p>Carlo Buontempo, the head of Copernicus Climate Change Service, said: "Right now, the recent series of global high-temperature records has paused after the hottest July ever recorded two years ago. But this does not mean that climate change has stopped. In July, we still saw the effects of global warming, like very high temperatures and floods."</p>
            <p>Although July this year was not as hot as the hottest July two years ago and the second hottest July last year, the average temperature on Earth's surface was still 1.25 degrees Celsius higher than in the years 1850 to 1900. This was before factories were common, when people started burning a lot of fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels creates gases that trap heat, which is the main reason for climate change.</p>
            <p>Also, for the 12 months from August 2024 to July 2025, the average global temperature was 1.53 degrees Celsius higher than before factories were common. This is more than the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit set by the Paris Agreement. This agreement started in 2016 and aims to stop global warming. Last year was the hottest year ever recorded around the world.</p>
            <p>Currently, the global temperature increase has not officially gone over the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit. This limit means the average global temperature over many decades. But some scientists think that it is no longer possible to keep the global temperature increase below this level. They ask governments to quickly reduce carbon dioxide pollution to make the increase smaller and stop more extreme weather events.</p>

            <h1>Worry About US Taxes: Business Group Asks if Giving Cash Can Help Local Spending</h1>
            <p>The United States started its temporary 20% tax on goods from Taiwan today, August 7th, Eastern US time. Hsu Shu-po, the head of the General Chamber of Commerce, said today that he hopes the government will work to make Taiwan's tax rate the same as Japan's and South Korea's. The challenge of these matching taxes from the US might hurt Taiwan's economic growth. We need to think about whether giving out cash to everyone can help boost local spending and make Taiwan's economy stable again.</p>
            <p>Before attending the 7th Brand Golden Sail Award ceremony today, Hsu Shu-po was interviewed. He said that President Lai Ching-te and his government team have stated that the 20% tax is temporary. He believes the government is working hard to lower the tax. Businesses also hope that Taiwan's tax rate can be lowered to the same level as Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. This would truly help Taiwan's industries. If the tax cannot be lowered, traditional industries might lose about 3% to 9% of their sales. They might also face problems like orders going to other companies and people losing jobs.</p>
            <p>Regarding whether the progress of the talks between Taiwan and the US should be made public, Hsu Shu-po said that Japan and South Korea have both faced issues with opening their agricultural markets. Taiwan might also need to open up some of its agricultural markets. But more importantly, the talks must also consider food safety. He also hopes the government will tell people and businesses how the tax will affect them, to reduce the impact.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-po pointed out that the US matching tax will affect the fastener industry the most. This is because over 40% of the fastener industry's sales go to the US. Car parts, plastic products, and plumbing parts are also affected. The government should talk more with businesses and help them deal with this. This includes keeping the exchange rate stable, helping businesses sell more in markets like Southeast Asia and Europe, and inviting international buyers to Taiwan. At the same time, he hopes that when the government talks with other countries, it can rely on the strong support of businesses and combine everyone's strength.</p>
            <p>US President Trump announced a 100% tax on semiconductors sent to the US. But if a company has factories in the US or is building them, they do not have to pay this tax. Hsu Shu-po said that the 100% semiconductor tax will not affect big Taiwanese companies like TSMC much. This is because companies with plans to invest or work in the US will not be affected. The stock market also went up a lot today. However, we still need to watch how the tax affects smaller and medium-sized companies later.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-po said that if the 20% matching tax is not lowered, some workers might lose their jobs in the short term. However, the exact situation will depend on how much each company can handle. He believes that the President and the government team will do everything they can to negotiate Taiwan's tax to be the same as Japan, South Korea, and the EU. This will help Taiwanese companies compete internationally.</p>
            <p>Also, people are paying attention to the idea of giving out 10,000 New Taiwan Dollars in cash to everyone. Hsu Shu-po said that the Legislative Yuan has already passed a special law for this. Now, Taiwan is facing challenges like the 20% matching tax from the US, which might cause economic growth to slow down. So, we need to think about whether giving out 10,000 NT dollars can boost local spending and help Taiwan's economy become stable again.</p>
