            <h1>Teacher Award Winners Ask for Less Office Work and More Student Choices</h1>
            <p>Today, the 2025 Teacher's Award ceremony took place. 72 teachers received this special honor. The award winners talked to the media and shared some ideas. They suggested making less office work for teachers and caring more about outdoor learning. They also suggested that students should not take too many classes. This way, students can learn what they really want to learn.</p>
            <p>Wang Chih-yuan, a professor from Sun Yat-sen University, got a bad infection when he was 45. Doctors had to remove his arms and legs to save his life. But he did not give up. He still teaches with a lot of passion. He not only teaches students knowledge, but also how to face life's challenges.</p>
            <p>Wang Chih-yuan told reporters today that he believes there is a reason why he is still alive. Before, he was strict with students and thought they thought too slowly. After his life-changing event, his way of teaching changed. He now understands that everyone learns at their own speed. Students need more help, not more pressure.</p>
            <p>Today, many students ask Wang Chih-yuan for help when they have problems. He humbly said that he is not a professional counselor. So, he mostly listens. He shares his own life experiences. He helps students think about how to solve problems and find more possibilities in life.</p>
            <p>Wang Chih-yuan also said that university students now take too many classes. They need to do internships, study abroad, and still finish school on time. He often sees students taking 27 or 28 credits in one semester. He explained that students in other countries usually take only 3 to 4 classes per semester. But for every 2 hours of class, they also spend 6 hours on activities outside of class.</p>
            <p>Wang Chih-yuan said that in Taiwan's university system, students often learn only a little bit from many classes. They take many credits but can only focus on 1 or 2 classes. He believes this wastes both teachers' and students' time. He hopes the system can get better. He also hopes students can think about how to learn more effectively.</p>
            <p>Another teacher who won the award is Chiang Yen-lin, a teacher from San Duo Elementary School in New Taipei City. He has taught dodgeball for a long time. He said today that he hopes children can have more chances to suggest what they want to learn. This does not have to be about school subjects.</p>
            <p>Chiang Yen-lin explained that many people worry teachers might not know what children want to learn. But he said no one knows everything from birth. Teachers and students can try things together. They can talk about "how to learn" and who can teach them. Even if they fail, it is still a good life experience.</p>
            <p>Ni Tung-chuan, a teacher at Huiji Junior High School in Taoyuan City, used to be a flight attendant. She saw children overseas were more confident and better at speaking. But she noticed many Taiwanese students were shy and quiet. So, she decided to become a teacher. She started teaching English in a children's cram school. Slowly, she studied more and entered the public education system.</p>
            <p>Ni Tung-chuan also taught Chinese in Michigan, USA, for three years. She hopes that teaching Chinese can help more people understand Chinese culture. This can help people understand each other better and solve problems. She also wants to encourage teachers who are open to new things to bravely try teaching overseas.</p>
            <p>Huang Nai-wen, a teacher at Anle High School in Keelung City, has worked in outdoor education for many years. He shared today that the secret to outdoor education is not to do it alone. Teachers from different schools can work together. They should check for dangers and get expert help. When more people help, children can explore more safely and freely.</p>
            <p>Chiang Tseng-wei-mei, a teacher at Hualien High School of Commerce, has worked in school administration for many years. She said that 8 hours a day is not enough. Teachers need to do many things at the same time. In the past, teachers worked from morning until night and did not rest on holidays. But now, younger teachers want more time to relax. This makes many people not want to do administrative work. She asked for administrative tasks to be simpler. She also wants to focus more on creating clear rules, so new people can learn quickly.</p>

            <h1>Meta Shows New Ray-Ban Smart Glasses with AI and Screen Inside</h1>
            <p>Today, Meta showed its first smart glasses for people to buy. These glasses have a small screen inside that shows information. Meta hopes these new glasses will be as popular as their other Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which sold well when AI started.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, showed the new Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses. He tried to show how to answer a call, but it did not work.</p>
            <p>Zuckerberg said, "I don't know what to say. I keep messing up." Even so, the people watching still clapped for him.</p>
            <p>These smart glasses have a small screen inside the right lens. It can show basic things like messages. They cost 799 US dollars (about 24,065 New Taiwan dollars). They will be sold starting September 30.</p>
            <p>Meta held its yearly Connect 2025 meeting for developers in California, USA, today. The new smart glasses were the most important part of the event.</p>
            <p>Meta has been a leader in making smart glasses. However, other companies like OpenAI (which made ChatGPT) and Google are ahead of Meta in making new, smart AI systems.</p>
            <p>To catch up in the AI race, Zuckerberg is trying hard to hire the best engineers in Silicon Valley. He is also promising to spend tens of billions of US dollars to buy the newest AI computer chips.</p>
            <p>Zuckerberg believes that smart glasses will be perfect for making "super smart" personal tools. This is because people can wear glasses all day. They can see, hear, and interact with the world from the wearer's point of view.</p>
            <p>To make this happen, Meta also showed a new pair of Oakley glasses called Vanguard today. These glasses are for sports lovers. They cost 499 US dollars (about 15,000 New Taiwan dollars) and will be sold starting October 21. These glasses can connect to fitness apps like Garmin and Strava. They can give live training information and summaries after exercise. Their battery can last for 9 hours.</p>
            <p>Besides these two new glasses, Meta also released a new version of the Ray-Ban series. Its battery lasts twice as long as the old one. The camera also takes better pictures. It costs 379 US dollars (about 11,400 New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>All these devices have features that already exist. These include Meta's AI assistant, a camera, and hands-free control. They can also share content to social media sites like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
            <p>IDC, a research company, thinks that in 2025, about 14.3 million smart glasses and virtual reality headsets will be sent out around the world. This is a 39.2% increase. A big part of this growth will be because of the Ray-Ban glasses series. Meta made these glasses with a big Italian glasses company called EssilorLuxottica.</p>

            <h1>Yang Shuang-tzu and Jin Ling Talk About Taiwan's Identity and Women's Love at Columbia University</h1>
            <p>Today, Yang Shuang-tzu, the writer of "Taiwan Roaming Record," and Jin Ling, the translator, gave a talk at Columbia University. They met with international students and professional translators. Andrew Nathan, a senior political expert from Columbia University, led the talk. They discussed many topics, from Taiwan's identity to the special bond between women.</p>
            <p>Last year, "Taiwan Roaming Record" won the National Book Award and the Asia Society's translated literature award in the US. Starting on the 17th, the writer Yang Shuang-tzu and translator Jin Ling are giving more talks in the US. They are meeting readers and people who join online.</p>
            <p>The first talk was at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University in New York. Many international students and people who translate books came to the event.</p>
            <p>Andrew Nathan, a Columbia University expert in politics and Chinese affairs, led the talk. He was very interested in the book's topics, like Taiwanese national identity, colonial history, same-sex feelings, and food. He praised the writer for her detailed historical research for the book.</p>
            <p>Yang Shuang-tzu said that two Japanese women writers came to Taiwan for a trip during the colonial period. They ate food from one end of Taiwan to the other. When she wrote the book, she focused on three main things: Taiwan in the 1930s, the main railway line, and the food people ate at that time.</p>
            <p>She also said that another part of the book is "lilies," which means the love between two women. This love makes the story softer when talking about difficult topics.</p>
            <p>Jin Ling, who studied at Columbia University, came back to her old school. Because she translated a lot of Taiwanese food in the book, readers might think she knows a lot about food. But she said she is not picky about food at all. When she worked at Columbia, she ate food from a nearby restaurant called Dig Inn every day. She often thinks about colonialism and politics, and this idea runs through her translation of "Taiwan Roaming Record."</p>
            <p>It's interesting that some readers ask her about the food in the book, but sometimes Jin Ling cannot remember it. She laughed and said, "There is too much food in the book, but I focused more on the historical parts."</p>
            <p>Many people at the talk were very interested in how Taiwan's government changed in recent history. They wanted to know how Taiwanese identity changed from the Japanese colonial period, to the Republic of China, and now to democratic Taiwan. They were also interested in women's roles in the country and Taiwan's future. Yang Shuang-tzu spoke freely about all these things.</p>
            <p>Yang Shuang-tzu and Jin Ling will continue to give talks in New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Texas. This will help them reach more American readers.</p>
