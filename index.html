A big flood in Texas, USA, has killed at least 120 people, including many children. People are asking if the government is doing enough to help. President Trump visited the area today.

News reports say that President Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, flew to the Hill Country area in central Texas by helicopter. They met with emergency workers, families, and local officials. A week ago, heavy rain made the rivers rise a lot, washing away houses, small cabins, RVs, and people.

Trump and Melania arrived in Kerrville, Kerr County, which was hit hardest by the flood. The Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, met them there.

Rescue teams have been looking for over 170 missing people for 8 days, including five girls from a summer camp. They are searching through piles of broken things and mud. People are worried that more deaths will be reported because no one has been found alive this week.

Trump did not answer questions about cutting money for federal agencies, which could affect disaster help. He said the flood was a "once-in-a-hundred-year disaster" that no one expected.

In an interview with NBC News, Trump said, "After seeing this terrible event, I think you would send out an alarm in some way. If they saw a lot of water or anything, the alarm would go off... but local officials were also hit hard, like everyone else."

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) only started helping with the Texas flood over the weekend, after Trump signed a statement to release federal money. But Trump has avoided questions about FEMA's future. This flood is one of the worst disasters in the US in recent years. It has also made people question Trump's plan to slowly remove FEMA and make states more responsible for disasters.

**Sinner Beats Djokovic to Reach Wimbledon Final, Will Play Alcaraz for Title**

In a big men's tennis match at Wimbledon today, Novak Djokovic, who has many Grand Slam titles, played against Jannik Sinner, the world's number one player. Sinner won the match 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. This is Sinner's first time reaching the Wimbledon final, where he will play against Carlos Alcaraz, who won last year.

The match between Sinner, the world number one, and Djokovic, who holds many Grand Slam records, was a very important one at Wimbledon this year. Djokovic has reached the Wimbledon final every year since 2018.

At the start of the match, Sinner broke Djokovic's serve in the third game. Sinner hit the ball perfectly from the back of the court many times, making the sixth seed, Djokovic, very tired.

Djokovic, who is 38 years old, struggled in the ninth game as Sinner attacked strongly. Sinner used his third chance to win the first set. Sinner also started strong in the second set, breaking Djokovic's serve first and leading 2-0, taking more control of the match.

At the start of the third set, Djokovic received a massage for a leg problem. However, he could not stop Sinner's strong play, and Sinner won the match in three straight sets.

Sinner had never reached the Wimbledon final before. In 2023, he lost to Djokovic in the semi-finals, and in 2022, he lost to him in the quarter-finals. But he beat Djokovic at the Australian Open in 2024 and at this year's French Open. Today, he won again and will now play Carlos Alcaraz in the final. Alcaraz is trying to win Wimbledon for the third time in a row. Last month, Sinner lost to Alcaraz in a very close French Open final, missing three chances to win. He really wants to get revenge in the Wimbledon final at Wimbledon.

**Hsieh Su-wei Reaches Wimbledon Women's Doubles Final, Aims for 10th Grand Slam Title**

Taiwanese tennis star Hsieh Su-wei, who wants to win her 10th Grand Slam title, reached the Wimbledon women's doubles final today. She and her partner Jelena Ostapenko from Latvia beat the top seeds 7-5, 6-4 in the semi-finals.

Last year, Hsieh won the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon with her Polish partner Jan Zielinski. This was her 9th Grand Slam title, showing she is a very versatile player. This year, she lost in the mixed doubles, so she hopes to get her 10th title in the women's doubles with her partner Jelena Ostapenko from Latvia.

Hsieh and Ostapenko are the 4th seeds in the Wimbledon women's doubles. Today, in the semi-finals, they played against Katerina Siniakova from the Czech Republic and Taylor Townsend from the US, who were the top seeds and tried to win again. Hsieh and Ostapenko lost their serve first in the first set. But then they broke their opponents' serve back right away. They used their opponents' mistakes and won the first set 7-5.

Hsieh and Ostapenko kept playing well in the second set. They broke their opponents' serve at the start. Hsieh almost lost her serve sometimes but managed to hold it. The team from Taiwan and Latvia stayed ahead. In the end, their opponents hit the ball out, and Hsieh and Ostapenko won 6-4. This means they will play in the Wimbledon women's doubles final.

Hsieh wants to win her 5th Wimbledon women's doubles title and her 10th Grand Slam title. She also wants to win her first title with Ostapenko. In the final, they will play against Elise Mertens from Belgium and Veronika Kudermetova from Russia. Elise Mertens used to be Hsieh's partner, and they won the women's doubles at the Australian Open last year.
