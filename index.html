            <h1>From Aviation Professional to Cultural Bridge Builder: Ho Ping-hsiu Shares the Joy of Music</h1>
            <p>A good performance needs everyone to work together. Besides the people who perform, the people working behind the scenes are very important. They should also get credit. CNA has a special column called "Behind-the-Scenes Heroes" every Wednesday to share their stories.</p>
            <p>Ho Ping-hsiu used to work in aviation. Now he helps connect cultures. For six years, Ho Ping-hsiu, who is the general manager of EVA Air's Austria branch, has helped the Vienna Boys' Choir and Taiwan to have close exchanges. Ho Ping-hsiu said that "the beauty of music itself" made him do all this.</p>
            <p>The Vienna Boys' Choir started over 500 years ago. In 2009, for the first time, a member from Taiwan joined. This was Ho Kuan-wei, Ho Ping-hsiu's son, who was only 10 years old then. When Ho Kuan-wei was 6, he passed an interview and went to the primary school of the choir's music school. After four years of music training, he moved up to the junior high section of the school. He was then chosen to join the choir and officially became a member of the Schubert Choir.</p>
            <p>Ho Ping-hsiu told CNA that it was a "tough time for parents." At that moment, he felt proud. He also thought his son could become more independent by living at school and touring the world. Ho Ping-hsiu remembered his son's first trip was to Mexico, very far away. He had to face a strange journey for a month by himself. "He didn't get used to it well. He even made up a story for the teacher, saying his grandma was very sick and he had to go back to Vienna to see her one last time."</p>
            <p>Ho Ping-hsiu took time off and quickly went to Mexico to check on the situation. "The choir had strict rules. I could only stay in the same hotels where they were staying at each stop. I had to appear like a normal audience member at the concerts." During that time, Ho Ping-hsiu became an "invisible volunteer." He helped film parts of the tour and made them into CDs. He gave these CDs to other parents who couldn't come along. He made valuable records of his son's growth. This also slowly built trust between him and the Vienna Boys' Choir.</p>
            <p>Ho Ping-hsiu remembered sitting in the audience, listening to his son perform with the choir. "Sometimes it was in a church, sometimes at a music festival. I listened to them using what they learned about different languages and cultures. They sang religious songs and folk songs from different countries. I smiled inside, felt less tired, and felt the happiness that music brought."</p>
            <p>Ho Kuan-wei is now grown up and studies data analysis. He still loves music. Ho Ping-hsiu, as a father, believes that children learn about the world and understand the beauty of different languages and cultures through singing. "This is not for competitions or shows. Instead, it is planting a seed for music and art." Starting in 2019, Ho Ping-hsiu began helping choirs from different parts of Taiwan. He helped them go to Vienna to have a week-long intensive workshop with the Vienna Boys' Choir.</p>
            <p>Ho Ping-hsiu said he hopes Taiwanese children can learn with top youth music groups from around the world. He wants them to experience real Austrian choir training and stage performances. This lets Taiwanese children see a different world. "Actually, there were many difficulties in the process. Taiwanese parents found it hard to let their children go so far away. But I think it's okay. The children who came will remember it forever."</p>
            <p>Ho Ping-hsiu is getting close to retirement. He said that his satisfaction as an aviation professional came from building bridges to the world. "I really hope that all these exchanges are full of the joy of music. I am also happy to keep sharing my experience of working deeply in Vienna."</p>
            <p>Ho Ping-hsiu said seriously, "If children see a bigger world when they are young, they will come back to Taiwanese society with different confidence and a broader view in the future."</p>

            <h1>France Plans to Recognize Palestinian State; Netanyahu Accuses Macron of Inciting Anti-Semitism</h1>
            <p>France plans to recognize Palestine in September. This has caused an argument with Israel. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that French President Macron is making "anti-Semitism" worse. This has made the disagreement between the two countries very serious, like a crisis.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the French President's office, the Elysee Palace, responded. They said Netanyahu's accusations were "bad" and "wrong." They added, "Right now, we need to be serious and responsible, not confuse people or change the facts."</p>
            <p>Netanyahu made these accusations in a letter to Macron. AFP saw the letter. In it, Netanyahu said that since Macron announced in July that France would recognize Palestine in September, anti-Jewish feelings in France have "risen a lot."</p>
            <p>In the letter, Netanyahu told Macron, "Your call to recognize Palestine is like adding fuel to the fire of anti-Semitism. This is not good diplomacy; it is trying to please people. This rewards the terrorist actions of Hamas, a Palestinian armed group. It makes Hamas more determined not to release hostages. It also makes those who threaten Jewish people in France bolder and encourages anti-Jewish feelings on your country's streets."</p>
            <p>After the war between Israel and Hamas started in the Gaza Strip almost two years ago, more and more countries have recognized Palestine. France is about to become one of them.</p>
            <p>According to AFP's numbers, at least 145 of the 193 United Nations member countries, including France, recognize or plan to recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>In response to Netanyahu's accusations of anti-Semitism, the Elysee Palace said France "has always protected and will always protect its Jewish citizens." They also said that the president's office "will never ignore" the accusations in Netanyahu's letter.</p>
            <p>France has the largest Jewish community in Europe. The French Interior Ministry reported that anti-Jewish incidents in the country increased from 436 in 2022 to 1676 in 2023. However, last year, the number went down to 1570.</p>

            <h1>TSMC ADR Drops 3.61%; Experts See Short-Term Fluctuations in Taiwan Stock Market</h1>
            <p>The US stock market's Nasdaq and Philadelphia Semiconductor indexes fell. Nvidia dropped by 3.5%, and TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) fell by 3.61%. Yesterday, Taiwan's stock market reached a new high during the day but closed lower. Experts believe that the technical indicators of Taiwan's stock market show a correction after rising too much. The overall upward trend has not been broken. They expect the market to be up and down in the short term, but generally strong.</p>
            <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give 15% of their profits from selling chips to China to the government. Today, US Commerce Secretary Lutnick confirmed that the US is talking with Intel about buying a 10% share. He also repeated his belief from before joining the government that the US needs to make its own chips. He said, "We cannot depend on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Nvidia and other popular stocks that benefited from the current AI boom took a short break from rising. Most of the four main Wall Street stock indexes closed lower today. The Nasdaq fell by over 300 points.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a little, by 10.45 points or 0.02%, closing at 44922.27 points. The S&P 500 index fell by 37.78 points or 0.59%, closing at 6411.37 points. The Nasdaq index dropped a lot, by 314.82 points or 1.46%, closing at 21314.95 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index went down by 104.81 points or 1.81%, closing at 5671.51 points.</p>
            <p>On August 19, Taiwan's stock market reached a new high of 24551.42 points during the day. Recently, strong stocks like those in the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) sector pulled back. This caused the index to go from positive to negative. It ended the day down by 129.02 points, closing at 24353.5 points, which is below the 5-day moving average of 24355 points.</p>
            <p>On August 19, the three major institutional investors sold more Taiwan stocks than they bought, by 18.617 billion NT dollars. Among them, dealers sold 6.079 billion NT dollars, investment trusts sold 1.53 billion NT dollars, and foreign and Chinese investors sold 11.008 billion NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Mu Hsien-chueh, the spokesperson for Kinsus, a big company that makes IC substrates, said at a PCB industry meeting on August 19 that their business will grow quarter by quarter in the second half of the year. The total business in 2026 will be better than this year. They still need to watch currency exchange rates. They expect good growth for ABF substrates in the next three years. This is mainly because of high-end servers and AI chip uses. They think that by 2026, there will be a good balance between supply and demand for high-layer ABF substrates.</p>
            <p>Getac Holdings, a company that makes strong industrial computers, held a meeting for investors on August 19. Chairman Hwang Ming-han said that their mechanical parts products did better than expected. They have raised their forecast for the growth of mechanical parts revenue for all of 2025 from 8% to 12% to 12% to 20%.</p>
            <p>Lintong, a microcontroller (MCU) maker under the Sunplus Group, said at an investor meeting that their business in the second quarter was not as strong as expected for a busy season. Their outlook for business in the second half of the year is still careful. Sunplus Innovation, a company that makes image signal processing chips, said that most customer orders are urgent. They expect their revenue in the second half of the year to be similar to the same period last year.</p>
