            <h1>Thailand's New Leader Names Cabinet Members, Says He Will Rebuild Trust</h1>
            <p>Bangkok, September 6 (Central News Agency) â€“ The person chosen to be Thailand's next Prime Minister, Anutin, announced today that he will choose experienced people for important jobs. An old diplomat will be the Foreign Minister. A high-level government worker will be the Finance Minister. And a former leader of a big oil and gas company will be the Energy Minister.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Anutin Charnvirakul said that these people â€“ Sihasak Phuangketkeow (a diplomat), Ekniti Nitithanprapas (an economist), and Auttapol Rerkpiboon (former head of PTT, a big Thai oil company) â€“ will lead their departments. He believes they will "bring trust" to the government.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Anutin promised today to lead the temporary government and prepare for new elections, as he had said before.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the parliament voted for Anutin to become the new Prime Minister. This ended a time when there was no clear leader for one week, after the previous Prime Minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was removed from her job.</p>
            <p>Anutin said at a meeting at his party's office, which was shown on Thai TV: "I think it is clear in politics that we will end the parliament within four months. I will form the new cabinet quickly."</p>
            <p>The former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who is a very rich man, suddenly left Thailand for Dubai in the United Arab Emirates yesterday, before the parliament voted. He said he went to visit friends and get medical help. The highest court will decide on September 9 if he must go back to prison. He was allowed to stay out of prison for health reasons after he came back from living abroad in August 2023. Some people think this court decision might send Thaksin to prison again.</p>
            <p>Anutin told reporters yesterday: "There will be no special treatment, no harm to anyone, and no revenge."</p>
            <p>Anutin has been a Deputy Prime Minister, Interior Minister, and Public Health Minister before. Many people know him for making cannabis legal in 2022. The King of Thailand still needs to agree for Anutin to officially become Prime Minister.</p>

            <h1>Surfer Dies After Shark Attack in Sydney, First Time in Over 3 Years</h1>
            <p>Sydney, September 6 (Central News Agency) â€“ Today, a surfer was attacked by a shark in Sydney, the main city of New South Wales, Australia. Police have said that the man died because of his serious injuries. This is the first time someone has died from a shark attack in Sydney in more than three and a half years. Because of this, some beaches have been closed for a short time.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the attack happened at Long Reef Beach, which is in the northern part of Sydney. Police said that just after 10 AM today, the man, whose name is not yet known, was surfing with friends about 100 meters from the shore when a large shark attacked him.</p>
            <p>John Duncan, a police chief for the Northern Beaches area of Sydney, said in a live TV meeting with reporters that other surfers pulled the man out of the water. But he had lost too much blood and died right there. His injuries were "very bad."</p>
            <p>Police also said that the man was an experienced surfer. Two pieces of his surfboard were found and sent for testing.</p>
            <p>Officials said that they do not know yet what kind of shark attacked the man today. The Northern Beaches Council in Sydney said that lifeguards are using jet skis to look for sharks at different beaches.</p>
            <p>The last time a shark killed someone in Sydney was in February 2022. That time, a swimmer was attacked near a beach. Before that, it was in 1963. This is the fourth shark attack that caused a death in Australia this year.</p>
