            <h1>Minister Gong Ming-hsin talks about minimum wage formula; Hong Shen-han says it shows employers' ideas</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 4th (CNA) â€“ The discussion about the minimum wage is coming soon. Earlier, Economic Minister Gong Ming-hsin said that the current way of calculating the minimum wage is not suitable this year. Labor Minister Hong Shen-han replied today that Gong Ming-hsin was sharing the thoughts of employers. He added that the Labor Ministry's job is to fully understand important economic numbers and the current economic situation for the discussion.</p>
            <p>Around the world, there are worries about equal tariffs. Gong Ming-hsin said earlier that even though the economy grew well in the first half of this year, this was mostly in high-tech industries. Small and medium-sized businesses and traditional industries were greatly affected. If they calculated the minimum wage using the old formula, the minimum wage would surely increase. He stated, "The old formula, at least for this year, is not very suitable." He plans to tell the Executive Yuan and the Labor Ministry his department's ideas.</p>
            <p>Today, Hong Shen-han responded to Gong Ming-hsin's comments for the first time. Hong Shen-han said that Gong Ming-hsin was just sharing what employers think. But, he explained, how the minimum wage is changed each year must include ideas from workers, employers, the government, and experts, to consider everything together.</p>
            <p>Hong Shen-han said that the Labor Ministry, as the body that reviews the minimum wage, will, according to legal rules, fully understand the current economic numbers, the social situation, and the opinions of all involved parties. They will think about everything carefully during the review. (Editor: Guan Zhong-wei) 1140904</p>

            <h1>UMC's August revenue falls below NT$20 billion, showing a decrease month-on-month and year-on-year</h1>
            <p>Hsinchu, September 4th (CNA) â€“ UMC, a company that makes computer chips, announced its August revenue. It dropped below NT$20 billion, reaching NT$19.16 billion. This is a decrease of 4.39% from the previous month and about 7.2% less than the same time last year. This shows a decrease both from the month before and the year before.</p>
            <p>UMC had previously expected that its chip shipments in the third quarter would increase by 1% to 3% compared to the second quarter. They also expected the average selling price of their products in US dollars to stay the same, with factory use rates between 74% and 76%.</p>
            <p>UMC's total revenue for the first eight months of the year was NT$155.816 billion, which is a 1.86% increase from the same period last year. The total revenue for July and August combined was about NT$39.2 billion. Experts believe that UMC's business performance in the third quarter should meet their expectations.</p>
            <p>UMC expects that its 22-nanometer and 28-nanometer technologies will continue to be chosen by customers. The company also hopes to get a bigger share of the market in wireless communication. To meet customers' needs for different ways of making products and to make the supply chain stronger, UMC plans to start making products at its new factory, phase 3 of Fab 12i in Singapore, in 2026.

            <h1>Does removing new youth housing loans from the Banking Act cause property speculation? Peng Jin-long: The situation is different from last year</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 4th (CNA) â€“ Today, the Executive Yuan decided that starting September 1st, people applying for new youth housing loans will not be counted towards the limits set by Article 72-2 of the Banking Act. Some people are worried if this new rule might cause property prices to increase again. Peng Jin-long, the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission, said that based on the number of applications, the new youth housing loans should now be for people buying homes to live in. Also, the Ministry of Finance has made improvements, so this situation should be completely different from last year.</p>
            <p>Article 72-2 of the Banking Act states that the total amount of money commercial banks can lend for building homes and businesses cannot be more than 30% of their total deposits and money from selling financial bonds. This is often called the "banking real estate loan limit." Recently, there were reports that people applying for home loans were told by banks that they had no more money to lend. The Executive Yuan decided today that starting September 1st, new youth housing loans will not be included in the Banking Act's limits. People think this means more money will be available for home loans, but it also makes them worried that house prices might go up again.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Peng Jin-long attended a Ghost Festival worship event with other department heads. After the event, Peng Jin-long told reporters that problems with home loans involve many different things. He spoke only from the Financial Supervisory Commission's point of view. He said the commission manages Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, which is a way to manage how much money banks have for lending.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long pointed out that over the past 10 years, real estate loans have grown by almost 85%, while deposits have only grown by about 73%. Recently, the property market has been quite busy, so the amount of money available for loans is tighter. Many facts show that we must try our best to help people who want to buy their first home to live in. Banks are special businesses that must provide loans for people's daily needs. Therefore, for the Banking Act, new youth housing loans made after September 1st will not be counted towards the Article 72-2 limit. This is to give more room to public banks that offer home loans.</p>
            <p>When asked by reporters if this relaxation might cause another wave of property speculation and what other rules are in place, Peng Jin-long said that for new youth housing loans, from their highest point last year to the first half of this year, they should now be for people buying homes to live in. This is true for both the number of loans and their purpose. Also, because the Ministry of Finance introduced improvements last year, these loans should already be for people buying homes to live in. So, the situation should be completely different from last year.</p>
            <p>This morning, Ruan Ching-hua, the Deputy Minister of Finance, explained more at a press conference after the Executive Yuan meeting. He said that last year, the number of applications for new youth housing loans was over 8,000 at its peak, but in July this year, it had dropped to just over 3,000. He believes that after the rules are relaxed, the ability to give out loans will increase. (Editor: Zhang Jun-mao) 1140904</p>
