As many people continue to work from home, cities are changing. Empty offices mean fewer people in some areas during the day. However, instead of just seeing empty buildings, cities are finding new ways to use public spaces. For example, some cities are creating more outdoor areas like parks, plazas, and pedestrian zones. These new spaces are designed for people to gather, relax, and socialize. They often include comfortable seating, green areas, and sometimes even small cafes or activity spots. The goal is to bring life back to urban centers and offer residents more opportunities to connect with each other, even if they are not going into an office every day. This shift shows how urban areas are adapting to new ways of working and living, making cities more enjoyable for everyone.

**Work: The Growing Popularity of the Four-Day Work Week**

More and more companies around the world are trying out a four-day work week. This means employees work fewer days, usually four, but still get paid the same amount. Recent studies show that this new way of working can be good for both employees and businesses. For workers, it often leads to better work-life balance, less stress, and more time for family or hobbies. For companies, some reports suggest that productivity does not decrease; in fact, it can even improve. This is because employees might feel happier and more motivated. Also, fewer work days can help companies save money on office costs. While it's not suitable for every industry, many businesses are seeing positive results and are considering making the four-day work week a permanent option.

**Travel: Europe's Popular Tourist Spots Prepare for a Busy Summer**

Europe is getting ready for another very busy summer travel season. After a few quieter years, many people are excited to travel again, and popular destinations like Paris, Rome, and Barcelona are expecting a large number of visitors. This is good news for local businesses, as tourism brings a lot of money to these areas. However, with more tourists comes the challenge of "overtourism." This means that places can become too crowded, which can harm the environment and make life difficult for local residents. Some cities are trying to manage this by limiting the number of visitors, promoting less famous areas, or encouraging tourists to travel at different times of the year. The aim is to make sure that travel is enjoyable for everyone and sustainable for the long term.
