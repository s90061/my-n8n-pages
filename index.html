            <h1>Czech Republic Sends First Documentary to Oscars, Showing a Legendary Photographer's Rebellious Life</h1>
            <p>A Czech documentary film named "I'm Not Yet Who I Want to Be" will represent the Czech Republic at the 98th Academy Awards. It will compete for the Best International Feature Film award. This movie tells the story of a famous photographer from the 1980s. It shows the hidden culture during the time of Czechoslovakia and talks about who people are, being free, and fighting back quietly.</p>
            <p>The Czech News Agency (캛TK) reported that "I'm Not Yet Who I Want to Be" shows the private diaries and thousands of photos of Libu코e Jarcovj치kov치, a famous Czech photographer from the 1980s. She bravely escaped to West Berlin and took photos for top fashion people in Tokyo. The movie shows how this great artist always stayed true to herself, no matter the time or place.</p>
            <p>Libu코e Jarcovj치kov치 is now 73 years old. Her photos show real life, including the hidden culture during the Communist period in Czechoslovakia. She also photographed the LGBTQ+ community, people who were not part of mainstream society, and her own life experiences. Her view is very special. In 2017 and 2019, she won the "Photographer of the Year" award from the Czech Association of Professional Photographers.</p>
            <p>"I'm Not Yet Who I Want to Be" was first shown at the Berlin Film Festival last year. This year, it won "Best Documentary" at the Czech Lion Awards. Kl치ra Tasovsk치, the director, said, "This is the first time in history that the Academy members decided to send a documentary film to compete. We are very thankful. It's a big surprise for us to be chosen from so many good films."</p>
            <p>Before this, the Czech Republic had never chosen a documentary film to compete for an Oscar. They usually chose longer movies. Tasovsk치 said this movie will have a chance to compete for both Best International Film and Best Documentary. "We basically have two choices," she said.</p>
            <p>So far, three films from Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic have won Oscars. These are "The Shop on Main Street" in 1966, "Closely Watched Trains" in 1967, and "Kolya" in 1996. Also, six other films were nominated for an Oscar.</p>
            <p>In 2019, the Czech film "The Painted Bird" was on the Oscar short list. In 2021, the Czech film "Charlatan" also achieved the same success.</p>
            <p>The Czech Film and Television Academy (캛FTA) started in 1995. It gives out the Czech Lion Awards and chooses films for the American Oscars. It currently has 436 members. This time, 194 Academy members voted.</p>

            <h1>Jiang Kai-jie Wins Powerlifting Gold at World Games with Amazing Deadlift Comeback</h1>
            <p>The World Games in Chengdu are ending soon. Today, Taiwanese powerlifter Jiang Kai-jie won a gold medal in a surprising way in the men's equipped middleweight final. In his last deadlift attempt, he successfully lifted 342.5 kg, after starting at 327.5 kg. This gave Taiwan another gold medal.</p>
            <p>Jiang Kai-jie is 36 years old. He has often competed for Taiwan in international powerlifting events. Last year, he surprised everyone at the World Powerlifting Championships by winning second place. This also earned him a spot at the World Games in Chengdu, China. Today, he competed in the men's equipped middleweight final. In the first two parts, squat and bench press, he lifted 352.5 kg and 227.5 kg. He was in 5th place for a while.</p>
            <p>Then came the last part, the deadlift. Jiang Kai-jie first lifted 315.0 kg, then 327.5 kg. For his third lift, he decided to add 15 kg, aiming for 342.5 kg. Before he started, he kept cheering himself on. In the end, he not only lifted the weight successfully but also won the gold medal with a total score of 107.54 points. He beat two Ukrainian athletes, Vitalii Kolomiiets and Mykola Barannik, in a surprising win.</p>
            <p>Also, in the women's equipped middleweight, Taiwanese athlete Huang Yen-tzu almost won a medal. But she could not lift 215 kg in her last deadlift attempt. She finished in 4th place with a total score of 108.86 points. Another Taiwanese female athlete, Hung Hsiu-ching, finished in 7th place with a total score of 102.07 points.</p>
            <p>With one gold and one silver medal from powerlifting today, along with the gold medal won by 21-year-old roller skating athlete Liu Chiao-hsi in women's speed slalom freestyle, Taiwan's team now has 3 gold, 5 silver, and 4 bronze medals. This puts Taiwan in 22nd place among 76 countries. Tomorrow, famous powerlifters Tian Ji-sen and Yang Sen will compete in the men's equipped super heavyweight category, and they might win more medals.</p>

            <h1>IET-KY: If Semiconductor Products Are for Defense, Trump Will Likely Make Them Tax-Free</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump recently said that tariffs (taxes) on imported semiconductor chips could be "possibly 200%, 300%." High Yung-chung, the leader of IET-KY, a company that makes special semiconductors, said that the US government's rules are not final yet. Right now, semiconductors have no tax. He thinks that if the products are needed for national defense, President Trump would likely find a way to remove the tax.</p>
            <p>News from other places said that former US President Donald Trump recently stated he would announce tariffs on imported steel and semiconductor chips in the next two weeks. He said the first taxes would be low to encourage companies to come to the US. Then, as more manufacturing is done in the US, the taxes would slowly go up, "possibly as high as 200%, 300%."</p>
            <p>IET-KY Chairman High Yung-chung said that the US government's rules are not decided yet. Now, semiconductors are tax-free. If the products are needed for defense, Trump would find a way to remove the tax.</p>
            <p>High Yung-chung pointed out that IET-KY already makes products in the US. However, they still face pressure from taxes because their raw materials come from all over the world. But right now, the taxes are not active, so it does not affect the company much.</p>
            <p>High Yung-chung mentioned that IET-KY has received a $4 million grant from the Texas Chips Act (TSIF) and has started building a new factory. They are also trying to get federal chip grants. But because the new US government wants more investment, including more use for defense and making machines in the US, IET-KY has changed its plans to try and get the federal government grants.</p>
            <p>At the same time, High Yung-chung suggested that companies applying for US government grants need a clear plan for their investment. He also said that it is very important to hire good advisors.</p>
            <p>Talking about the good things about investing in Texas, High Yung-chung explained that North Texas is the biggest place for high-tech manufacturing in the US. Texas Instruments also started in Texas, which created many semiconductor engineers and good facilities in North Texas. This is a strong point for North Texas.</p>
            <p>Also, High Yung-chung explained that Texas does not require workers to join a union, which makes it easier for companies to operate. Texas also does not have a state income tax, and property is cheaper. This makes it a good place for companies to invest. Also, the airport is very easy to use.</p>
            <p>But High Yung-chung stressed that investing in the US costs more than in Taiwan. Labor costs are much higher, and building factories takes longer. Taiwanese companies that want to invest in the US must be well-prepared and understand their own situation. Companies that open factories in the US can use the good things about Taiwanese companies, like controlling costs and caring about employees' personal lives. But they must not treat American employees the same way they treat Taiwanese employees.</p>
