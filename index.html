            <h1>US Adds Tariffs to 407 Steel and Aluminum Products; South Korea Helps Companies</h1>
            <p>South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said today that the United States has put more taxes on steel and aluminum products. Because of this, the South Korean government will give more help to small and medium-sized businesses in the country that are affected.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency reported that starting August 18th, US Eastern Time, the government of US President Trump will add a 50% tax on 407 types of steel and aluminum products. The US had already put a 50% tax on all imported steel and aluminum products, which started on June 4th.</p>
            <p>According to South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Korea International Trade Association, the new list of products with added taxes includes machines, car parts, electronic devices, and home appliances.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a press release, "To make sure our companies are hurt as little as possible, the government will greatly expand its current help programs for small and medium-sized businesses. This will help them deal with the import rules from Washington."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that on August 15th, the Trump government added more products to the list of steel and aluminum imports that get a 50% tax. Hundreds of related products were added to this list, starting on August 18th.</p>
            <p>That evening, the US Department of Commerce announced in the Federal Register that the Bureau of Industry and Security added 407 product codes to the US Import Tariff Schedule. This is to identify goods that will have extra taxes on their steel and aluminum parts.</p>
            <p>The announcement said that for parts that are not steel or aluminum, Trump's taxes on goods from certain countries will still apply.</p>

            <h1>CNN: US Allows H20 Chips to China Again; Beijing Doesn't Like It, but Chinese Companies Still Want Them</h1>
            <p>CNN reported that the US government has stopped some export rules. It now allows Nvidia's special AI chip, the H20, to be sold in China again. However, China is not happy about this. They even said the chip could be a risk to national security. Still, Chinese companies are very eager to buy these chips.</p>
            <p>A few weeks ago, the US changed its rules about technology and removed the ban on selling H20 chips to China. After this, Beijing said the H20 chip was a national security risk. They even asked leaders from Nvidia, a big AI chip company, to explain. China also told its companies not to use this chip.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that China's unhappy reaction shows that Beijing wants to make all its own computer chips. It also shows China's belief that its own advanced chip industry is growing fast.</p>
            <p>This cold reaction from China might also be a political move. Even though China has made big steps in making chips, it still needs American chips and technology.</p>
            <p>Experts say that Huawei, a big Chinese tech company, has already made chips that work as well as or even better than the H20. But China still wants more advanced AI processors. These are still not allowed to be sold to China because of US export rules.</p>
            <p>Xiang Ligang, a leader in a Beijing tech group, said that when US President Trump first put rules on Huawei many years ago, China's chip technology grew very quickly. This happened mainly because the US put more export rules, which made China feel more frustrated and push harder.</p>
            <p>He said, "We have this ability. It's not what they think, that China cannot work if it's blocked, or that China will be finished."</p>
            <p>For Xiang Ligang, the sudden change in US policy shows that it is very important for China to have its own chip supply chain. He also said, "For Chinese companies, if we want to make sure our chip supply is safe enough, it means we might only have the choice to rely on chips made in China."</p>
            <p>On the other hand, China is worried that the H20 chip could be a national security risk. It is said that the H20 has features like "tracking location" and "remote shutdown." Some US lawmakers asked for these features to be added to Nvidia chips, but Nvidia said it does not put these features in its chips.</p>
            <p>Xiang Ligang also said that China thinks the US is not playing fair. He pointed out, "You refuse to sell us what we really want. You think products that are old news are something you want to sell and take over our market? Do you really think we are that naive?"</p>
            <p>Even with Beijing's worries, Chinese companies are still very eager to get these chips.</p>
            <p>Bernstein, a company that studies stocks, believes that without Trump's export rules, Nvidia could sell about 1.5 million H20 chips to China this year. This would bring in about 23 billion US dollars. Big buyers include ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, and other Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent.</p>
            <p>Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst at Bernstein who studies China's chip industry, thinks that the main reason Chinese companies want H20 chips is that Huawei cannot make enough of its own chips, and Nvidia has a well-developed system.</p>
            <p>He stressed that even if China wanted to replace all H20 chips with chips made in China, there would still not be enough. Bernstein expects that Huawei will ship about 700,000 advanced chips this year, which is much less than what the Chinese market needs.</p>
            <p>However, experts still say that the speed of China's semiconductor technology growth should not be ignored. Lin Qingyuan said that the US has made its export rules tighter over the years. This has made Beijing more eager to make its own chips and has also given them a chance to do so.</p>
            <p>He said that after Huawei showed its best smartphone in 2023, which had advanced chips that US officials thought were hard to make, chip manufacturing technology seemed to stop growing. But Chinese companies that make chip equipment are still making steady progress.</p>
            <p>Bernstein also predicts that the share of AI chips made in China will go up from 17% in 2023 to 55% by 2027. At the same time, the market share for US suppliers like Nvidia and AMD will fall a lot, from 83% to 45%.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Coast Guard Ships Often Enter Diaoyu Islands Waters; Japan Uses "Sea Guardian" Drones to Watch</h1>
            <p>Sankei Shimbun reported that Chinese Coast Guard ships often go into Japan's waters around the Senkaku Islands (also called Diaoyu Islands). The Japanese government has decided to use large drones called "Sea Guardian" (MQ-9B) from its Coast Guard. These drones are now being used.</p>
            <p>The report says that several sources shared information. Because the waters around the Senkaku Islands are very large (4740 square kilometers), they decided to use the "Sea Guardian" drones. These drones have the newest radar and surveillance tools. They will work with current patrol boats and manned planes to make monitoring better and to expand security.</p>
            <p>Since Japan made the Senkaku Islands its property in 2012, Chinese Coast Guard ships have often sailed in those waters. From 2020, Chinese Coast Guard ships have been seen there almost every day.</p>
            <p>According to the Japan Coast Guard, Chinese Coast Guard ships sailed in the outer area next to the Senkaku Islands for 355 days in 2024. This was 3 days more than in 2023, setting a new record. The Coast Guard also found that since June last year, all Chinese Coast Guard ships seemed to have objects that look like machine guns.</p>
            <p>The Japan Coast Guard started using "Sea Guardian" drones in 2022 and now has three of them. A large "Sea Guardian" drone is 11 meters long, 24 meters wide, and 4 meters tall. It can fly as high as about 12,000 meters and as far as about 4,800 kilometers. It can stay in the air for 24 hours. This big drone has an infrared camera, radar, and other tools. It can be controlled from the ground to watch ships and other things.</p>
            <p>The report states that by using "Sea Guardian," the Japanese government wants to show that it is trying to stop China from changing the situation on its own and strongly claiming ownership of the Senkaku Islands. It is still unclear if this will scare China away.</p>
