**White House: Treasury Secretary Bessent to Visit Japan for Expo Event on July 19**

The White House announced today that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead a group to Japan. They will go to the Osaka Kansai Expo event on July 19. A senior U.S. official said that Bessent will not have official meetings or trade talks with Japan during this trip.

The White House said that President Donald Trump announced Bessent would lead a presidential group to Japan for the Expo event on July 19. Other members of the group include U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau.

Earlier this week, Trump said new tariffs of 25% on Japan would start on August 1. People are watching to see if Bessent will meet with Japan's Minister of Economic Revitalization, Akazawa Ryosei, who is discussing the tariffs with the U.S.

Since Trump announced equal tariffs in early April, Akazawa Ryosei has visited the U.S. seven times to talk about tariffs, but there have been no clear results yet.

Recently, Trump has often said he is unhappy that Japan does not want to buy more U.S. cars and rice. On July 7, he posted a letter on social media that he sent to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The letter said Japan would face new taxes of 25%, which is more than the 24% announced in early April.

The Japan Times reported that Japan's Foreign Ministry said Bessent and Akazawa Ryosei talked on the phone for 30 minutes yesterday after Trump sent the letter. They had an open and deep talk and agreed to continue discussions.

The report also said a senior U.S. official stated that Bessent's trip to Japan is mainly for the Expo event. He will not have official meetings or trade talks with Japanese officials.

During the 2025 World Expo in Osaka Kansai, there is an event called "National Day" where participating countries show their culture and traditions. America's "National Day" is planned for July 19, and Bessent will be there as a U.S. government official.
