A White House official said that countries still discussing trade deals with the US might get more time before new taxes on goods start. This is for countries that are willing to agree.

US President Trump's temporary stop on tariffs is ending soon, on July 9th. The US has only finished talks with the UK, China, and Vietnam. Another country, Cambodia, also said it reached a deal with the US.

Stephen Miran, a White House economic advisor, said he is hopeful for more deals this week. He explained that trade agreements take time, and the final decisions often come close to the deadline. He expects countries that are serious about reaching a deal but need more time to get an extension. Countries that are not willing to compromise may face higher taxes.

**Top tennis player Sabalenka wins easily, moves to Wimbledon quarterfinals.**

Aryna Sabalenka, a tennis player from Belarus, won her match at Wimbledon easily. She won in two sets against Elise Mertens from Belgium. Sabalenka has not lost a set yet in this tournament and is now in the top eight players in the women's singles.

Sabalenka, who is 27 years old, has never reached the final at Wimbledon. She is now the only player left from the top six seeded players.

Sabalenka couldn't play in Wimbledon last year because she was hurt. In 2022, she was not allowed to play because players from Russia and Belarus were banned after the war started in Ukraine. She showed strong play by winning 6-4, 7-6 against Mertens, wanting to make up for lost time. She will play against Laura Siegemund from Germany in the quarterfinals on July 8th.
