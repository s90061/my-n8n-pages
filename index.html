            <h1>Akie Abe Visits Digital Lee Teng-hui Exhibition, Hopes AI Will Carry On Shinzo Abe's Wisdom</h1>
            <p>Akie Abe, the wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visited the "Digital Lee Teng-hui" special exhibition today. Using artificial intelligence (AI) technology, she spoke Japanese and took photos with the late President Lee Teng-hui. Akie Abe also mentioned that she is preparing "Digital Shinzo Abe." She hopes to use technology to pass on Abe's life wisdom and aims to finish it before July next year.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Akie Abe, Lee An-ni (the chairperson of the Lee Teng-hui Foundation), Jin Meiling (former national policy adviser to the President's Office), and Akio Yaita (executive director of the Indo-Pacific Strategic Think Tank), among others, went to the National Taiwan Library. They visited the "PROTOTYPE: Mr. Democracy 2.0 Digital Lee Teng-hui Special Exhibition" organized by the Lee Teng-hui Foundation.</p>
            <p>Akie Abe looked at Lee Teng-hui's image on the screen. She spoke to the AI Lee Teng-hui in Japanese and took a photo. Something funny happened during this. When Akie Abe introduced herself to AI Lee Teng-hui as Akie Abe, the wife of Shinzo Abe, the AI only heard "Akie Abe." So, it replied, "You are not Shinzo Abe's wife, because Shinzo Abe's wife is Akie Abe."</p>
            <p>After seeing the exhibition, Akie Abe told reporters that she did not know what AI Lee Teng-hui was before. After visiting, she found it very amazing. She said it can take photos and talk. It helps people understand Lee Teng-hui in many ways.</p>
            <p>Shinzo Abe passed away three years ago. Akie Abe is also thinking about "Digital Shinzo Abe" to remember and pass on Abe's life wisdom using technology. Akie Abe said she hopes it can be finished before July next year so everyone can see AI Shinzo Abe.</p>
            <p>Akie Abe said that Lee An-ni is her "Taiwanese sister." Lee An-ni has very modern ideas. Akie Abe learned a lot today and will take what she learned back to Japan.</p>
            <p>Lee An-ni said that the Digital Lee Teng-hui special exhibition will be open for a long time. She hopes people can come to talk and take photos with Lee Teng-hui, listen to him sing, and see him "move" in photos. The main goal of creating AI Lee Teng-hui is to find the true meaning of "immortality." The digital Lee Teng-hui exhibition is just the start, and there is more to do in the future.</p>

            <h1>Diving Accident Near Guishan Island: Yacht Crew Member Drowns</h1>
            <p>There was a diving accident near Guishan Island in Yilan today. A 33-year-old yacht crew member, Mr. Li, sadly drowned while free diving. When he was pulled out of the water, he showed no signs of life. He was taken back to shore and rushed to the hospital, but he could not be saved. The police are still investigating what caused the accident.</p>
            <p>Because of Typhoon Kagas, the wind and waves along Taiwan's northeast coast are getting stronger. The Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area Administration announced around noon today that Guishan Island would be closed for two and a half days, starting from noon until September 23. Soon after this announcement, news came of someone drowning near Guishan Island.</p>
            <p>Around noon, the First Patrol District of the Coast Guard Administration received a report. A male crew member named Li from a yacht drowned while diving near the "Turtle Tail" area of Guishan Island. He showed no signs of life when rescued. Another yacht helped take him back to Wushih Port in Toucheng. He was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late.</p>

            <h1>Remembering the 921 Disaster: Vice President Hsiao Says Disaster Prevention Needs Everyone's Help to Protect Our Home</h1>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said that 26 years ago today, the 921 earthquake happened in Taiwan. The pain from this disaster still stays in many people's hearts. So, every year on September 21st is "National Disaster Prevention Day." Preventing disasters needs everyone's effort to protect our beloved home.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao shared on Facebook that "National Disaster Prevention Day" on September 21st reminds everyone to learn from past events. It also encourages us to work harder on disaster prevention and be fully prepared for the future.</p>
            <p>She said that besides the national alert drill everyone's phones received two days ago, the government also started the "All-out Defense Resilience Committee." This committee is working on different ways to prepare for tough situations. They are also making important buildings stronger, teaching disaster prevention in schools, and sharing experiences with other countries. All these efforts help Taiwan become more resilient to disasters.</p>
            <p>The Vice President stated that the government has created a handbook called "When Crisis Comes: Taiwan's All-out Safety Guide." This guide uses simple pictures and words to teach people how to prepare disaster supplies and how to stay calm during a disaster. This helps people make disaster prevention a part of their daily lives.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that preventing disasters needs everyone's help to protect our beloved home. When a crisis happens, having the right knowledge and preparations can greatly reduce harm. The better we prepare for disasters, the safer our lives will be, and the more resilient our country will become.</p>
