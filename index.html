            <h1>China says there is a higher risk of infectious diseases due to more rain.</h1>
            <p>China's National Disease Control Bureau said today that there is a higher risk of diseases carried by insects and animals. This is because many people are moving around, and there has been a lot of rain. The Bureau also said that the upcoming "National Day holiday" and Mid-Autumn Festival are popular times for travel. People need to be careful and plan their trips well to prevent sickness.</p>
            <p>China's official TV news channel, CCTV, reported that the Disease Control Bureau announced the current situation of important infectious diseases and health advice today.</p>
            <p>The Bureau explained that the risk of diseases carried by insects and animals is high. This is due to several reasons: people are moving a lot, there is more rain, insects that carry diseases are very active, and animals that carry diseases are moving more widely. Also, they looked at how infectious diseases usually spread and checked disease information from many sources. They said that there is a higher chance of many people getting gut infections like Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease and Norovirus. However, other quick breathing illnesses like the flu are not very common.</p>
            <p>The Bureau also warned that in one week, the "National Day holiday" and Mid-Autumn Festival will start. This is a very busy time for travel. Before going on holiday, people should pay close attention to health advice from the government. They should also find out about any disease outbreaks at their travel destination. It is important to prepare and plan travel activities carefully.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Disease Control Bureau said that after returning home, people should check their health. If they have a fever, cough, vomiting, or skin rash, they should try not to go to group events. They should see a doctor quickly and tell the doctor where they traveled and what they ate.</p>

            <h1>Mayor Chen Chi-mai Checks Flood Control in Renwu and Qishan Because of Typhoon Kashima's Rain.</h1>
            <p>Today morning, Mayor Chen Chi-mai went to Guanyin Lake detention basin and Qishan No. 5 pumping station. He checked flood prevention work and made sure side drains were clear. This is to prepare for the heavy rain that Typhoon Kashima's outer winds might bring to the mountains of Kaohsiung.</p>
            <p>This morning, Mayor Chen Chi-mai visited Renwu, Qishan, and other areas. He checked the flood prevention work and how well the drains were cleared. First, he visited the Guanyin Lake detention basin. To make Dazhe and Renwu areas better at handling floods, the city government turned Guanyin Lake into a flood control pond that also acts as a detention basin. It can hold up to 560,000 tons of water.</p>
            <p>At the site, Mayor Chen Chi-mai told the Water Resources Bureau to make the area look nicer. He also asked them to think about building bridges to connect the inside and outside of the lake. This would make Guanyin Lake detention basin useful for both flood control and recreation.</p>
            <p>After that, Mayor Chen Chi-mai went to Qishan No. 5 pumping station. He checked how the pumping machines were working. This station has 4 pumping units. They help to guide water away and pump it out strongly. This greatly improves the problem of water collecting in low-lying areas nearby.</p>
            <p>During his visit, Mayor Chen Chi-mai also checked the cleaning of side drains in Dazhe and Qishan. He made sure the drains were open. He also gave drinks to the workers to thank them for their hard work. He thanked the cleaning staff for helping to clear the side drains and keep the environment clean. He also reminded them to be careful and stay safe.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau said they are still sending out many people to clear main roads and water outlets. Today, 642 people and 77 vehicles worked to clear side drains and water outlets on main roads in the city. They cleared a total length of 37.13 kilometers. They removed 6706 blocked water outlets by the road and 4162 blocked drain covers.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen Chi-mai said that the city government has started all its disaster prevention plans. Before the typhoon warning is completely lifted, they will continue to improve disaster response in all areas. Because there is still a high chance of rain in the mountains from the typhoon, he asks people to avoid going to the mountains for hiking or camping.</p>

            <h1>People in Nantou's Mingjian Township say "No" to an Incinerator. The Environmental Ministry asks local areas to talk more.</h1>
            <p>Today, people in Nantou's Mingjian Township again said they are against building an incinerator. The Environmental Ministry said that managing trash is a local matter. The Ministry wants all local areas to be able to deal with their own trash. However, they should still talk well with local people. The Ministry also said that reducing trash from the start is the most important way to solve the problem.</p>
            <p>Today, the Mingjian Township Anti-Incinerator Self-Help Association and environmental groups held a press conference at the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Central Taiwan Innovation Campus. They spoke against the Nantou County Government's rough decision to build an incinerator in Mingjian Township. They explained the harm an incinerator would cause to local residents and local businesses. They strongly said that an incinerator should not be built.</p>
            <p>During the press conference, some people became very angry and pushed with the police for a short time.</p>
            <p>Today, Environmental Minister Peng Chi-ming was at the "2025 Asia Carbon Pricing Forum." When he spoke to the media, he said that local governments are mainly in charge of trash and waste management, and the Environmental Ministry helps them. From the Ministry's point of view, they hope that all local areas can manage their own trash.</p>
            <p>Minister Peng said that in the past, Nantou was like "kicking the ball around." They used to send their trash to the Taichung incinerator to be burned. But now, other cities and counties cannot help them. This is why so much trash has piled up. He supports Nantou dealing with its own trash, but they must talk openly with the public. They also need to make local people less worried about air pollution and how it might affect farming.</p>
            <p>Minister Peng stressed that the best way to handle trash is to reduce it from the beginning. He gave Changhua as an example: after checking trash bags, the amount of trash there has gone down by 20% to 30%. He encourages all city and county governments, environmental groups, and people to work together to reduce trash at the source. This will help lower the burden on Taiwan's limited ability to process trash.</p>
