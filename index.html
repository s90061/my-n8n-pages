Yemen's Houthi rebels recently attacked commercial ships in the Red Sea. This shows that the group, which is supported by Iran, is increasing its threats to trade ships. Because of these actions, international oil prices went up for the second day in a row today.

In New York, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August delivery went up by 40 cents, or 0.59%, closing at $68.33 per barrel. In London, the price of Brent crude oil for September delivery went up by 57 cents, or 0.82%, closing at $70.15 per barrel.

**Trump Not Worried About Musk Forming New Party: "Third Parties Always Help Me"**

Billionaire Elon Musk has announced he is starting a new political party called the "America Party" after a disagreement with former US President Donald Trump. Today, Trump said he is not worried about Musk's new party. He believes it could actually help him, stating that "third parties have always helped me."

Musk strongly disagreed with a large tax cut and spending law that Trump supported. The day after Trump signed that law, Musk announced the formation of his "America Party" to challenge the traditional two-party system in the US. When asked by reporters during a cabinet meeting if he was worried about Musk's party, Trump replied, "No." He added, "I think this will help us, it should, third parties have always helped me," but he did not explain further.

Trump had previously called Musk's plan "ridiculous." However, some news reports and analyses suggest that Musk's party could indeed be a threat to the Republican Party, which currently has a small majority in Congress. Although Musk has not given many details about his party's platform, he plans to participate in next year's US midterm elections. He aims to win several seats in both the House and Senate and has even said he wants to remove members of Congress who supported Trump's controversial law.

Matt Shoemaker, a national security analyst and former intelligence officer, said that Musk's America Party could be a major factor that changes the 2026 midterm elections, especially for the Republican Party. Unlike other third parties that have appeared in the past, Elon Musk has almost unlimited money and is popular among many young American men. Shoemaker believes Musk's personal brand could attract independent voters and young people who are good with technology and are unhappy with politics. These voters might normally support Republicans in important voting areas.
