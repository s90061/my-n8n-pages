            <h1>Train Delay: No Relief for Extra Train Conductor, Taiwan Railways Delayed by 16 Minutes</h1>
            <p>Today, July 26, was the first time people voted to remove politicians from office. Taiwan Railways (TRA) added an extra train, the 5371 Tze-Chiang Limited Express, from Qidu to Taitung. When the train arrived at Chaozhou Station, the train conductor's replacement was not there. After quickly sending someone else, the train was delayed by about 16 minutes. TRA said they will find out who is responsible.</p>
            <p>Today, people voted to remove 24 Kuomintang lawmakers and Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an, who was suspended. To handle more travelers, TRA added extra trains for the weekend, including the 5371 Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Qidu to Taitung today. But news came out that when the train reached Chaozhou Station, the train conductor's replacement could not be found.</p>
            <p>TRA explained that a deputy manager in charge of assigning train staff in Kaohsiung made a mistake. They wrote the wrong date for the extra train, so a conductor was not assigned. After the train staff department was told, they immediately sent a conductor who was waiting to work.</p>
            <p>Because of this mistake, where a conductor was not assigned, the train left about 16 minutes late. TRA said that their Southern Operations Office will review what happened and make improvements. They will also find the people responsible for the mistake to stop it from happening again.</p>

            <h1>Uni-President Lions Speed Up Finding New Players; Leader Says Foreign Players Being Taken by Others Shows Good Talent Scouting</h1>
            <p>On July 26, it was reported from Taipei that Cristopher Mercedes, a foreign pitcher for the Uni-President 7-ELEVEN Lions in Taiwan's baseball league, has been signed by a Korean team. Team leader Su Tai-an thanked Mercedes for his help. He said that the Lions already had two foreign pitchers they wanted to sign. Because this happened suddenly, they will now move faster. Su also said that even though foreign pitchers are often taken by other teams, it means the Lions are good at finding talented players.</p>
            <p>After their game yesterday, the Lions were suddenly told that Cristopher Mercedes, their foreign pitcher, was bought by the Kiwoom Heroes in the Korean league. Also, Joe Wieland is sure he wants to retire. So, now the team only has three foreign pitchers left: Brock Dykxhoorn, Yohander MÃ©ndez, and Felix Pena.</p>
            <p>Today, Mercedes went with the main team to Taipei Dome. Before the game, he talked and hugged his teammates. Team leader Su Tai-an said that it is common for foreign players to be taken by other teams during the season. This means Mercedes played very well if another team wanted him. Su met Mercedes before the game to say thank thank you. Mercedes helped the Lions a lot to win the first half of the season. Mercedes was sad to leave, and the Lions wished him well.</p>
            <p>When asked why foreign players have often been taken by other teams recently, Su Tai-an said that it also shows something good: it means the Lions are good at choosing players. Su mentioned that they already had two foreign pitchers they wanted to sign. They will consider any good players before the deadline for foreign players. Now, they are speeding up their plan to find new players. They also quickly met with the scout department to bring foreign players to Taiwan as soon as possible.</p>
