They beat their strong opponent, Puerto Rico, with a score of 12 to 1. This was the first time Taiwan joined this competition, and they won.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, and Taiwan's representative to the U.S., Yu Tai-hsiang, sent congratulatory messages immediately. They praised the Taiwan team for their excellent performance. Ambassador-at-large Liu Po-chun, who helped lead the team to the U.S. for this exchange, said she hopes to encourage the players to "see the world."</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Department of Education stated that the team showed amazing strength.

            <h1>"Magical Taiwan â€“ Taiwan Literature Exhibition" Opens in Osaka at Culture Expo</h1>
            <p>"We TAIWAN: Taiwan Culture in Osaka, Kansai Expo" opened the "Magical Taiwan â€“ Taiwan Literature Exhibition" today. Wang Shih-sze, the Deputy Minister of Culture, said the exhibition space feels like a magical place. It brings spirits, demons, and mythical creatures into a classical setting. Chen Ying-fang, the director of the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, hopes the exhibition will help Taiwan and Japan feel a connection. She also hopes it will show the diverse and accepting nature of Taiwanese literature.</p>
            <p>The exhibition is held at the Osaka Central Public Hall. This old building was built in 1918 in a Western style. The ceiling in the exhibition room has paintings of Japanese myths. The Taiwan literature exhibition uses three double-sided displays shaped like theater stages. These displays show six themes, including "Indigenous Culture," "The Influence of Japanese Culture," and "Rediscovering Taiwanese Folk Customs."</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sze said that the Osaka Central Public Hall is a magical place. This very old venue matches the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, which is in a national historic building built in 1916. She added, "Today, we bring monsters, spirits, and mythical creatures into this space. We also make this place full of blessings."</p>
            <p>She explained that in Taiwan, the relationship between gods and people is special. "We are a country that treats gods as friends," she said. In many literary works, you can see people's hopes, desires, things they regret not doing, and things they care about deeply. These feelings become characters in stories and are kept forever.</p>
            <p>She said that when we see spirits, demons, and monsters, we can think about them differently. Perhaps in literature, they are not really scary. Instead, they are desires and wishes that could not be achieved in this life. These desires continue in different times and different stories. They complete their purpose and make the world between humans, gods, and mythical creatures complete.</p>
            <p>The National Museum of Taiwan Literature planned this exhibition. Chen Ying-fang said they worked specially with the Taiwan Fu Cheng Huang Temple this time. This temple is the first City God Temple in Taiwan. When they talk about spirits, demons, and monsters, they also want to show Japanese visitors how special Taiwanese gods are. Taiwanese gods are not just powerful protectors; they also represent blessings and good fortune. This unique cultural idea, like the content of Taiwanese literature, is diverse and accepting. It can include different ideas and voices.</p>
            <p>She said she hopes this literature exhibition will help Taiwan and Japan find common feelings. At the same time, she wants people to see their differences and understand each other better. This is the main goal of this exhibition for visitors.</p>
            <p>Chen Ying-fang pointed out that this literature exhibition starts with Indigenous literature. It shows how Taiwanese literature has grown over time. It not only shows Indigenous literature but also includes works by Japanese writers who lived in Taiwan and wrote about it from an outsider's view. For example, Mitsuru Nishikawa (1908-1999) and Haruo Sato (1892-1964) showed Taiwan's strange appearance through different cultural perspectives.</p>
            <p>She also said that the exhibition shows Taiwanese folk customs as an important source of creative power. It also presents works by modern writers who combine Taiwan's real society and natural environment. These works blend history, nature, and magical realism. Additionally, Taiwanese poetry is also wonderful. Through different types of works, she hopes Japanese visitors can feel the charm of Taiwanese literature, which is like word magic.</p>
