        const text = `**Trump and Musk Disagree**

US President Donald Trump said on July 1st that he might consider sending Elon Musk, a rich tech businessman, out of the country. This is because Musk has criticized a new government spending law that Trump supports. Musk also said that if this law passes, he would start a new political party called "America Party."

Musk used to be a big supporter of Trump and even led a new government department for him. However, they started disagreeing publicly in June. Musk has also been critical of the Republican party for not helping the electric car industry enough.

President Trump also said that the government might look into the money Musk's companies, like Tesla and SpaceX, have received from the government. Trump thinks Musk is angry because the new law might stop supporting electric cars, and he warned that Musk could lose a lot more.

**Investigation into Recall Petitions in Nantou**

Authorities in Nantou have looked into groups that want to remove Legislator You Hao and County Councilor Chen Yu-ling from their positions. The main people leading these efforts, Lin Jing-tong and Cai Yi-chu, were questioned by the police. After being questioned, they were allowed to go home but must stay in their homes.

The group trying to recall You Hao said they followed all the rules. They stated that volunteers collected all signatures, and there were no fake names. They asked the court to quickly find out the truth and clear their names. There were also rumors that some people who signed had already passed away.

Legislator You Hao said that the current government is using the legal system unfairly against them, especially because the vote to recall Chen Yu-ling is very soon. He believes that the people of Nantou are simply trying to use their power to remove Chen Yu-ling because they are unhappy with her.
