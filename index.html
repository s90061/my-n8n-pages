A former government official and a former KMT party leader in Keelung were kept in detention by the court. They are suspected of illegally using personal information to support a recall effort against a politician. The group trying to recall the politician asked KMT legislator Lin Pei-xiang to apologize. Lin Pei-xiang said he respects the court's decision.

The recall group leader, Chen Ching-yi, said that Lin Pei-xiang, as the head of the KMT in Keelung, should apologize to the public. Chen said it's wrong for a political party to use people's private information without their permission, even if they are party members.

Lin Pei-xiang said he believes people are innocent until proven guilty and will respect the judicial process. This case is about a recall attempt against two DPP city council members. The court extended the detention of the two men for another two months because they might try to change evidence or talk to witnesses.

Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani hit his 30th home run of the season in the 4th inning, helping his team win 6-1 against the Chicago White Sox. This means Ohtani has hit 30 or more home runs for five seasons in a row. His teammate, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, also got his 8th win as a pitcher.

Before hitting the home run, Ohtani accidentally hit the umpire's knee with a foul ball. He stopped to check on the umpire before hitting his long home run. This hit was very powerful and flew for a long time.

The Dodgers played well and gave Yamamoto a big lead early in the game. The Dodgers have won 13 of their last 16 games and are leading their division. Yamamoto pitched for 7 innings, giving up only 1 run and striking out 8 batters to earn his win.

**First "Knowlesi Malaria" Case in 20 Years from Outside Taiwan, Travel Warning for Philippines Raised**

Taiwan has a new case of malaria from outside the country. A foreign man got a fever and dark urine after visiting Palawan Island in the Philippines. This is the first case of "Knowlesi malaria" in 20 years that came from outside Taiwan. Because of this, Taiwan has raised its travel warning for the Philippines to Level 1, which means "watch out."

Malaria is a disease caused by mosquitoes that carry parasites. This new case is from a type of malaria called Knowlesi malaria, which is usually found in monkeys in Southeast Asia. The man did not take medicine to prevent malaria and was bitten by mosquitoes there.

He started feeling sick with a headache, fever, and muscle pain before coming to Taiwan. He went to the hospital and was diagnosed with malaria. This type of malaria has become more common in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand since 2004. The government reminds people traveling to Palawan Island to use mosquito repellent and wear long-sleeved clothes. If you plan to stay in jungle areas or are at high risk, you should talk to a doctor before your trip about preventing malaria.
