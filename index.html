            <h1>Naomi Osaka Beats Coco Gauff at US Open, Reaches Quarter-Finals</h1>
            <p>Today, Japanese player Naomi Osaka won against Coco Gauff from the US. The scores were 6-3 and 6-2. With this win, Osaka has moved into the quarter-finals of the US Open in women's singles.</p>
            <p>Naomi Osaka won the US Open in 2018 and 2020. Coco Gauff won the US Open in 2023.</p>
            <p>Osaka, who is the 23rd seed in the tournament, beat Gauff, the 3rd seed, in two sets today. The match only took 1 hour and 4 minutes. Osaka also beat Gauff in their first match at the US Open in 2019, when Gauff was only 15 years old.</p>
            <p>Before this year's US Open, Gauff changed her coach. She hoped to make her serves better. But in this match, she had problems again. She made 5 double faults. Gauff also made 33 mistakes that were not forced, which is much more than Osaka's 12 mistakes.</p>
            <p>After the match, Naomi Osaka said, "I feel a bit emotional, I don't want to cry."</p>
            <p>She also said, "I really enjoy my time here. This is my favorite court in the whole world, and it means a lot to me to be back."</p>
            <p>Osaka's performance at the US Open now is her best in a Grand Slam singles tournament since she had a baby in 2023 and returned to playing the next year.</p>
            <p>Next, Naomi Osaka will play against Karolina Muchova from the Czech Republic. Muchova won her match against Marta Kostyuk from Ukraine with scores of 6-3, 6-7 (0/7), and 6-3. This win means Muchova also got a spot in the quarter-finals.</p>

            <h1>Iga Swiatek Wins Easily, Moves to US Open Quarter-Finals</h1>
            <p>Today, Polish tennis star Iga Swiatek won her match in the fourth round of the US Open women's singles. She beat Ekaterina Alexandrova from Russia, who was the 13th seed, with scores of 6-3 and 6-1. Swiatek easily moved on to the quarter-finals of the US Open.</p>
            <p>Swiatek, who is the 2nd seed in this year's US Open, beat Alexandrova in about 1 hour. After this win, Swiatek has reached at least the quarter-finals in all four Grand Slam tournaments this year.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first set, both players were playing well. The score was 3-3. Then, Swiatek won the 7th game and two more games in a row to win the first set.</p>
            <p>In the second set, Swiatek continued to play strongly. She controlled the match and easily won the second set with a score of 6-1. This meant Alexandrova was out of the tournament.</p>
            <p>Swiatek has won 6 Grand Slam titles so far. Four of these wins were on the clay courts at the French Open. However, today's win shows that she can play very well on any type of court.</p>
            <p>Swiatek, who is 24 years old, was happy with how she played after the match. She said, "Things are different every month. As long as I feel good about my game and my mindset is good, I can handle any surface."</p>
            <p>In the US Open women's singles quarter-finals, Swiatek will play against the winner of the match between Amanda Anisimova from the US and Beatriz Haddad Maia from Brazil.</p>
