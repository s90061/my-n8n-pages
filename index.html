            <h1>Oil Prices Rise Sharply as Markets Look at Trump-Putin Meeting and U.S. Interest Rate Cuts</h1>
            <p>Oil prices went up a lot today, about 2%. They reached their highest point in a week. This happened because U.S. President Trump warned that talks with Russian President Putin about the war in Ukraine could have "serious consequences" if they fail. Also, people in the market think the U.S. might lower interest rates next month. This could make people want more oil.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures went up by 1.21 U.S. dollars, or 1.8%. The price closed at 66.84 U.S. dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil went up by 1.31 U.S. dollars, or 2.1%. The price closed at 63.96 U.S. dollars.</p>

            <h1>Trump to Hold Talks with Putin: Hopes to Prepare for U.S.-Russia-Ukraine Summit</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump will meet with Russian President Putin in Alaska. Trump said today that his main goal for tomorrow is to prepare for a three-way meeting between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine. He hopes this meeting will happen soon, and he might invite some European leaders. He also believes that if he were not the U.S. President, Putin would take over all of Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for almost three and a half years. Trump is planning to have a one-on-one talk with Putin tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska, which is the biggest city there. This will be the first time current presidents from the U.S. and Russia have met since 2021.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Trump spoke to the media in the Oval Office at the White House. He said he thinks tomorrow's meeting with Putin will be "a good meeting." But he said the second meeting is more important. This would be a three-way talk between Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and himself. He added, "Maybe some European leaders will be invited, maybe not, I'm not sure yet."</p>
            <p>He believes that Putin wants peace, and Zelenskyy also wants peace. He said, "We will see if they can get along. If they can, that would be very good."</p>
            <p>Trump stated that his only goal tomorrow is to get ready for a meeting with the leaders of the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine. He hopes it can happen soon, preferably right there in Alaska.</p>
            <p>He said, "We will see everyone's position clearly." He believes he can tell if the meeting will be good or bad within minutes. "If the meeting does not go well, it will end quickly; if it is good, there will quickly be a peaceful result."</p>
            <p>Trump thinks Putin wants to make an agreement. In Trump's opinion, if he were not the U.S. President, Putin would try to take all of Ukraine. "But I am the president, and he will not fool me."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told the media that Trump will travel to Alaska tomorrow morning. He will have a one-on-one meeting with Putin. After that, the U.S. and Russian teams will have a dinner, and then a press conference will be held.</p>
            <p>Since Trump returned to the White House earlier this year, he has been trying to get a permanent ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. But so far, he has not gotten any major agreements from Russia.</p>

            <h1>Russia and Ukraine Exchange Prisoners Before Trump-Putin Summit</h1>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine said today that they have exchanged 84 prisoners of war each. This is the latest exchange in a series of prisoner swaps between Russia and Ukraine this year. Hundreds of people have been set free so far.</p>
            <p>This exchange happened before Russian President Putin and U.S. President Trump are set to meet for a summit in Alaska on August 15th.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media that the exchanged prisoners included "both soldiers and regular people." Some of them "had been held by the Russians since 2014, 2016, and 2017."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that "people who bravely defended Mariupol" were part of this exchange. Mariupol is a port city in Ukraine. Russian forces surrounded it for almost three months in February 2022 before they took control of it.</p>
            <p>The Russian Ministry of Defense announced on Telegram that the United Arab Emirates helped with this prisoner exchange. The Russian people who were released are now getting "mental and medical help."</p>
            <p>Large-scale prisoner exchanges were the only real success from three rounds of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian groups. These talks happened in Istanbul from May to July.</p>
            <p>In the most recent talks last month, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange 1200 prisoners from each side.</p>
            <p>A Russian negotiator said that Moscow also offered to give back the bodies of 3000 fallen soldiers to Kyiv.</p>
