Taiwan's top badminton player, Chou Tien-chen, had a tough first match at the BWF Super 300 Canada Open. He played against Julien Carraggi from Belgium. Chou, who is ranked 6th in the world, surprisingly struggled against Carraggi, who is ranked 61st.

In the final game, Chou kept playing well and stayed ahead. He was leading 14-9 at one point. Even though his opponent caught up, Chou used his experience to score three more points and win the match 21-17. This win helped him move on to the round of 16.

**Taipei Plans New Air Quality Zone, Daan District Construction Sites to Be Controlled First**

Taipei City's Environmental Protection Department is planning to create a fifth Air Quality Control Zone. This is to make the air cleaner and keep people healthy. The new zone will include major roads in the Zhongshan and Fuxing areas. Construction sites in the Daan District will be the first to follow new rules. These changes are expected to start in phases in 2027.

Since 2021, Taipei has already set up four air quality zones. These zones cover famous places like the National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and Taipei 101. In these areas, older diesel trucks and buses need a special "excellent" mark, and older motorbikes need to pass an exhaust test every year. Some construction machines also need a "clean emission" mark.

The new fifth zone will be put in place in two steps. The first step, in 2027, will cover parts of Zhongshan North and South Roads, and Fuxing North and South Roads. The second step, in 2028, will add 14 main roads in Daan District and all construction sites there. Also, starting from 2027, some construction machines that are two years old or more will need a special mark to enter the zone.

The Environmental Protection Department said that Daan District will be a test area for controlling construction sites. If rules are broken, fines from NT$500 to NT$5,000 will be given. The goal is to have these rules cover the whole city by 2030. Since the first two zones started, there have been about 15,000 fines, which is about 300-400 fines each month.

**Hey Song Company Works with 34 Schools to Promote Environmental Protection, Helps Create First Junior High Eco-School in Taoyuan**

The Hey Song Education Foundation has been teaching about protecting the environment for a long time. They have helped 34 schools change and teach about environmental sustainability. They also helped create the first junior high school in Taoyuan to become an "eco-school," meaning it focuses on environmental education. The Ministry of Environment gave them an award for their great work.

The Hey Song Education Foundation announced today that the Hey Song Company started the foundation in 2013. It helps schools become "Eco-Schools" by following a special program. Hui-Chi Junior High School in Taoyuan is one of the schools that worked with the Hey Song Foundation. It is the first junior high school in Taoyuan to get this eco-school certification.

The principal of Hui-Chi Junior High, Li Wen-yi, said that their teachers used the "Green+ Campus Ecology Project" from the Hey Song Foundation. They learned from other eco-schools. They designed outdoor classes using nearby Tiger Head Mountain and Taolin Railway. Students went on walks to watch eagles and clean mountains. This helped students connect with nature and care about their local area.

The Hey Song Foundation said that many students at Hui-Chi Junior High come from single-parent, grandparent, or new immigrant families, and they don't often get to do outdoor activities with their parents. Through the classes, students watched red-bellied eagles on Tiger Head Mountain and saw a documentary. They started to think, "If an eagle eats a poisoned mouse, will it also get poisoned?" So, they suggested that the community use less mouse poison and instead use eco-friendly ways to control pests. This kind of thinking and caring is very important for environmental education.

Thanks to these lessons, Hui-Chi Junior High School got its "Eco-School" certification this year. It is the first junior high school in Taoyuan to get this. This gives more young people a chance to learn about the environment and connect deeply with the land. The Hey Song Foundation has worked on environmental education for 12 years, helping over 47,000 teachers and students from 68 schools. They will continue to help schools with environmental education. In 2024, they also started a "Seed Teacher Project" to train teachers in 13 areas of Taoyuan, creating a network to help each other with environmental education.
