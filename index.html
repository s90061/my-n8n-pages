A man named Hsieh, 46, had a history of domestic violence. On July 7, he followed his wife, Ms. Chang, and her sister when they left their home. He then attacked them with a knife on Mingde Road in Tucheng. Both women died from their injuries after being taken to the hospital. The police quickly found Mr. Hsieh in Changhua and arrested him.

Earlier, in May, Ms. Chang had asked for a temporary protection order, which was approved in late June. On July 6, Mr. Hsieh went to his wife's home and broke things at the door. He was taken to the prosecutor for breaking the protection order but was later released because it was his first time and no physical harm was done.

On July 7, the court held a hearing for a full protection order for Ms. Chang. After the hearing, as Ms. Chang and her sister rode a scooter, Mr. Hsieh followed them in his car. He stopped, got out, and attacked them. After questioning, Mr. Hsieh was sent to the New Taipei District Prosecutor's Office on July 8. He claimed he committed the crime because his wife's family had looked down on him for a long time. The court decided to keep him in custody without allowing visitors or communication, as he is accused of murder and breaking the domestic violence law.

**Bangladesh Changes Friends: Moves Closer to China and Pakistan, Away from India After Prime Minister Removed**

After protests last year led to the removal of Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the country's foreign relations have changed. Because neighboring India did not like that their ally, Hasina, was forced out, Bangladesh is now becoming closer to China and Pakistan, who are not close to India.

Hasina, 77, went to New Delhi after thousands of protesters entered her home in August. She did not attend her trial in Bangladesh in June for crimes against humanity and was sentenced to six months for not showing up. Bangladesh's current leader, Muhammad Yunus, said that many people in Muslim-majority Bangladesh are now angry at India because India gave Hasina a safe place.

Meanwhile, Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, visited China first in March. During this trip, he got investments, loans, and aid worth 2.1 billion US dollars. China is also talking directly with other important politicians in Bangladesh. Leaders from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is expected to win next year's election, said China wants to work with Bangladesh's next elected government with "sincere and strong feelings." Bangladesh is also becoming closer to Pakistan, which is India's long-time rival. In June, officials from Bangladesh and Pakistan met with Chinese officials in Beijing to discuss working together in trade, industry, education, and farming.
