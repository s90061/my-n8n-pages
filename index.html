            <h1>Australia's Great Barrier Reef Coral Declines, Worst in Nearly 40 Years</h1>
            <p>A study released today shows that the amount of coral in two of the three areas of Australia's Great Barrier Reef dropped the most in one year that has ever been recorded. This happened because of a very bad coral bleaching event in 2024, which affected the largest area ever.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) said the amount of coral in the southern and northern parts of the Great Barrier Reef had the biggest yearly drop since they started checking 39 years ago. After growing steadily for several years, the coral cover went down by about one-fourth to one-third.</p>
            <p>Mike Emslie, who is in charge of the long-term study, said, "We are now seeing bigger changes in how much hard coral there is." He noted that this has been happening for almost 15 years, which shows that the ecosystem is under stress.</p>
            <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the biggest coral reef system in the world. It is about 2,400 kilometers long and is located off the coast of Queensland in northern Australia.</p>
            <p>Since 2016, the Great Barrier Reef has had five summers of big coral bleaching events. Large areas of coral turned white because of high temperatures, which put them at a higher risk of dying.</p>
            <p>The report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science stated that the coral bleaching event in 2024 was the most serious ever. All three main areas had serious to very serious bleaching.</p>
            <p>Even though the United Nations suggested putting the Great Barrier Reef on UNESCO's list of endangered World Heritage sites, it has not been officially added yet.</p>
            <p>The Australian government has tried for many years to stop the Great Barrier Reef from being listed as an endangered World Heritage site. This is because the Great Barrier Reef brings about 6.4 billion Australian dollars (about 124.5 billion New Taiwan dollars) to Australia's economy each year.</p>

            <h1>Chiayi County Wife Suspected of Stabbing Husband to Death, Autopsy on 8th to Confirm Cause of Death</h1>
            <p>In Chiayi County, a husband and wife had another argument about money early this morning. The wife, Ms. Huang, is thought to have used a fruit knife to stab her husband, Mr. Zhuang, to death. Police and prosecutors checked the body and found many sharp wounds on Mr. Zhuang, mainly on his neck, chest, and back. An autopsy is planned for August 8th to find out the exact cause of death.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi District Prosecutors Office stated that after police, prosecutors, and a doctor checked the body, they found Mr. Zhuang had many sharp wounds. These were mostly on his neck, chest, and back. Because the hospital had already sewn up the wounds a little, it was not possible to see how deep they were. An autopsy is planned for August 8th to confirm the cause of death.</p>
            <p>The Shuishang Police Station in Chiayi County said that at about 1 AM, they received a call for emergency help in Sanhe Village, Shuishang Township. When police arrived, they found 36-year-old Mr. Zhuang with knife wounds. They quickly called the fire department to take him to the hospital. He later died even after doctors tried to save him. The person suspected of doing this is Mr. Zhuang's 30-year-old wife, Ms. Huang.</p>
            <p>Police said that when officers arrived, Mr. Zhuang was lying on the floor in a room on the third floor, and there was a lot of blood. They immediately started helping him. Ms. Huang, who is suspected of the crime, was sitting quietly nearby. The couple's three sons, aged 7, 5, and 2, had already been taken to the first floor by family members. The knife, thought to be the murder weapon, was on the living room floor on the first floor.</p>
            <p>Police stated that Mr. Zhuang had several knife wounds, and many stab wounds on his chest and back. After questioning, the case was sent to the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office as a murder case.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors said that Mr. Zhuang and Ms. Huang often argued over small things from 2019 to 2024. They had reported each other to the police for domestic violence. In 2019, their family was listed as a high-risk family, but this status was removed the next year.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors found that Mr. Zhuang and Ms. Huang worked as delivery drivers to earn money for their family. However, Ms. Huang had almost stopped working as a delivery driver after her third son was born two years ago. Mr. Zhuang was the only one earning money through deliveries. Recently, because of a storm and continuous heavy rain in early July, Mr. Zhuang did not get many delivery orders. The couple started arguing about money again. Mr. Zhuang would curse at Ms. Huang. It seems they argued about money again early this morning, which led to this sad event.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors said that after this murder, they immediately told the social welfare department, and social workers were sent to investigate. The three young children are currently being cared for by relatives. After an urgent placement evaluation, the 2-year-old son will be cared for by relatives, and the 7-year-old and 5-year-old sons need urgent placement.</p>

            <h1>Dawu Mountain Trail Severely Damaged, Closed Until Year-End</h1>
            <p>The Beidawu Mountain hiking trail has been damaged by heavy rain. Many parts of the path have fallen in, and parts of the road base are gone. The Pingtung Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency said today that the trail will be closed until December 31st this year. People who have paid for mountain huts can get all their money back.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency released a statement saying that the Beidawu Mountain trail was first planned to be closed until August 10th. However, after checking the damage, they found that parts of the trail at 0.45 km, 0.55 km, 0.65 km, 2.45 km, and 6.1 km have fallen in. At 1.5 km, a wooden bridge was hit by falling rocks. At 2.6 km, the road base is gone, and the path has become narrower. Also, parts of the connecting industrial road have been washed away underneath.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung Branch said that the Beidawu Mountain trail will now be closed for a longer time, until December 31st this year. People who have already paid for a place to stay can ask for a full refund through the mountain hut application system.</p>
            <p>In addition, other trails managed by the Pingtung Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency, such as the Liuyi Mountain Trail, Lingshan Trail, Shuangxi Arboretum Trail, Shimen Mountain Trail, and Gaoshifo Trail, are open again starting today. However, the western part of the Jinshuiying Trail is still closed because some parts of the Dahan Forest Road have collapsed. It will be checked again after the road is fixed.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung Branch asked people to be careful. They said that the soil in the mountain areas still has a lot of water. This means there is still a risk of falling rocks, landslides, and fallen trees. People should avoid going to the mountains for now.</p>
