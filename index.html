The weather office says that Typhoon Danas's outer part, along with strong afternoon rain, will cause heavy rain in Changhua and Yunlin today. Areas south of Miaoli, including Taitung (and its islands Lanyu and Green Island), Hengchun Peninsula, and Hualien mountains, might also have heavy rain.

The weather office warns that there will be short periods of very strong rain. People should be careful of thunder and strong winds. In the mountains, watch out for landslides and falling rocks. In low areas, be careful of floods.

**Tainan Mangoes Are Popular Again in Malaysia, Thanks to Mayor Huang Wei-che's Promotion**

Tainan mangoes are very popular! After being praised in Singapore, they are now a big hit in Malaysia too. Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che announced today in Malaysia that Tainan is working again with a large supermarket chain there. This means people in Malaysia can enjoy fresh Tainan mangoes this year.

Mayor Huang went to Southeast Asia on July 3rd to promote Tainan's farm products. Because Typhoon Danas was getting close to Taiwan, his event today was changed to a quick visit. After the event, Mayor Huang quickly returned to Taiwan to keep an eye on disaster plans and make sure the city is safe.

At today's event, many people came to support, including Taiwan's representative in Malaysia. Mayor Huang said that last year, Tainan's farm products went to Malaysia for the first time. They introduced three types of Tainan mangoes â€“ Irwin, Sis, and Jin Hwang â€“ to Malaysian shoppers, and they were very popular. This year, they brought more high-quality Tainan mangoes.

Mayor Huang said that even though there are many mangoes from different countries in Malaysia, Tainan mangoes are special. Their unique smell, full fruit, and sweet taste make them stand out. People in Malaysia really like them.

**Taipower Gets Ready for Typhoon Danas with Over 4000 Workers on Standby**

Taipower announced today that they are fully preparing for Typhoon Danas. They want to prevent damage from strong winds and heavy rain. They have checked all their disaster tools and materials. More than 4000 workers are ready to fix things, and repair vehicles and equipment are prepared. They will quickly help where needed.

Taipower said they learned from past typhoons. They worked with local governments early to cut tree branches to prevent problems. For mountain areas that might have landslides or blocked roads, they will use drones to check and report damage quickly, making repairs faster.

Taipower asks everyone to help prepare for the typhoon. For example, fix signs tightly and take down anything hanging. If you see broken or exposed power lines, do not touch them and tell Taipower right away. For basements in areas that get easily flooded, put up waterproof gates or sandbags at the entrance to stop water.

Also, Taipower asks places like pumping stations or users who need power all the time for life support equipment to get their own generators or backup power systems early.

Taipower said that if power goes out because of the typhoon, they will work hard to fix it quickly. They will restore power by starting with main power stations, then main lines, and finally smaller lines. They will first fix public services like the MRT, trains, water, and phone systems.

Taipower reminds people that if their power goes out, they can use the "Taiwan Power APP" to report it. They can also use the "Typhoon Power Outage Information" section on Taipower's website during the typhoon. Just put in your address and what happened to check or report the outage. Please save the 1911 customer service number for people who cannot use the internet or prefer to call.
