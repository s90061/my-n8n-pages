            <h1>Trump says a Gaza agreement is coming soon, which can end the war of nearly two years.</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C. â€“ US President Trump said today that he believes an agreement to end the war in the Gaza Strip is coming soon. This comes after recent talks with Israel and Arab countries.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Trump told reporters at the White House, "I think we have an agreement."</p>
            <p>He also said, "It looks like we have an agreement for Gaza. I believe this agreement will free the hostages and end the war."</p>
            <p>However, Reuters reported that Trump did not share more details.</p>
            <p>This week, world leaders met at the United Nations headquarters in New York. At this time, the US announced a 21-point peace plan for the Middle East. Its goal is to stop the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has been going on for almost two years.</p>
            <p>According to Steve Witkoff, a special US envoy, this plan was given to officials from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, and Pakistan on September 23rd.</p>

            <h1>iPhone 17 Series Review: Experts Say Air Model Changes Ideas About Thin Phones</h1>
            <p>Taipei â€“ The new iPhone 17 series phones have been on sale for one week. However, Apple's official website and stores still don't have enough phones to meet demand. Tim Ge, a tech expert, reviewed all the new models. He said the standard iPhone 17 offers great value for its price and is the most surprising new product this year. The iPhone 17 Pro model is made for professional photography. The iPhone Air model makes people think differently about how thin a phone can be.</p>
            <p>If you go to Apple's official website today, you will see that if you order an iPhone 17 or iPhone 17 Pro, you will have to wait 2 to 3 weeks for it to arrive. The larger iPhone 17 Pro Max takes even longer, about 3 to 4 weeks. On the other hand, the iPhone Air is not selling as fast. All colors are available now, and you can buy it in Apple stores.</p>
            <p>Tim Ge told reporters that the standard iPhone 17 is very popular this year because it costs less and has clear improvements. It gives a lot of value for its price. It might make people who use mid-range Android phones switch to iPhone. However, most buyers will likely choose the top-tier iPhone 17 Pro series first, then the iPhone 17, and finally the iPhone Air.</p>
            <p>Tim Ge said clearly that the iPhone Air only works with an eSIM (embedded SIM card). It does not use a physical SIM card. This is one reason why some customers hesitate to buy it. Many older people don't even know what an eSIM is. But he agrees that being thin and light is very important. The Air feels great to hold, and when you pick it up for the first time, it feels amazing. It also has a strong titanium frame, so it won't break easily. It is also easy to recognize when you take it out.</p>
            <p>He guesses that Apple might first watch how people react to the new Air product line. Then, they will decide what new features or parts to add to the next version.</p>
            <p>Talking about the iPhone 17 Pro model, Tim Ge thinks it is more like a professional camera this year. All three back cameras are now 48-megapixel. You can change the focus length, which is like carrying eight small lenses with you. The improvements in taking photos and videos are very clear.</p>
            <p>The iPhone 17 is 7.95 millimeters thick and weighs 177 grams. This is lighter than the iPhone 17 Pro, which is 8.75 millimeters thick and weighs 204 grams.</p>
            <p>The iPhone 17 Pro has an advantage over the standard version. It has a new telephoto camera. Its sensor is 56% bigger than the previous model. This camera can take photos with 8 times optical zoom at a 200mm focus length.</p>

            <h1>Labor Group Says Zhengzhou Factory Overworks to Make Phones; Foxconn Says Employee Safety is Important</h1>
            <p>Zhengzhou â€“ A labor rights group has released a report. It says that workers at Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory in China, where the newest iPhone 17 phones are made, still work in very bad conditions. They work long hours and their pay is often late. Foxconn has replied, saying that the company puts the health and safety of its employees first.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times and Bloomberg News reported on this. "China Labor Watch," a human rights group based in the US, did a six-month investigation of Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory this year. They sent undercover workers to talk to more than 100 employees at the factory.</p>
            <p>China Labor Watch found that during busy production times, Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory employs about 200,000 workers. More than half of these workers are "temporary workers." But Chinese law says that the number of temporary workers should not be more than 10% of all company employees.</p>
            <p>These temporary workers do not get the same benefits as regular employees. The China Labor Watch report also said that some of the temporary workers' pay is held back and paid late. This is to stop them from leaving during the busiest time of making Apple iPhone phones.</p>
            <p>Also, most temporary workers earn between 25 and 28 Chinese Yuan per hour. But some earn as little as 12 Chinese Yuan per hour, depending on their experience. Many employees said they often work extra hours to earn more money per hour.</p>
            <p>China Labor Watch pointed out that most workers work 60 to 75 hours per week. This is much more than the maximum legal working hours in China. It is also more than Apple's own limit of 60 hours per week.</p>
            <p>China Labor Watch also said that the Zhengzhou factory has a system that treats some ethnic minority groups and pregnant women unfairly when hiring.</p>
            <p>Foxconn replied to this. They said the company does not accept unfair treatment and puts employee health and safety first. They welcome helpful talks with all groups involved and are willing to share their improvements and progress.</p>
            <p>Apple also said that after learning about China Labor Watch's findings, their team went to the factory and started an investigation right away. Apple "follows the highest standards for workers, human rights, the environment, and ethics."</p>
