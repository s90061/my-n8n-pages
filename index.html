<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506290105.aspx">News Link</a>

Taiwan's pig industry is making big changes. The World Organization for Animal Health recently said that Taiwan is free of three major pig diseases: hog cholera, African swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease. This is a first for Asia and is good for Taiwan's pork exports.

To help with this, Taiwan's Ministry of Agriculture is improving pig farms and slaughterhouses. They want to make them cleaner and more efficient. Jia-Yi-Shiang, a top meat company, is building Taiwan's first automated AI slaughterhouse. The Ministry of Agriculture has approved this plan.

The new AI slaughterhouse in Yunlin is expected to open in 2027. Mr. Chen Kuo-Hsun, the chairman of Jia-Yi-Shiang, said this is important for Taiwan's pork to be competitive internationally. He hopes it will become the "TSMC of the slaughter industry," meaning it will be a leader in its field.

Jia-Yi-Shiang's older slaughterhouse in Pingtung already has a special certificate for food safety (HACCP). They sell pork to big food factories in Taiwan and have also been successful in exporting pork. For example, they were the first to send fresh pork to the Philippines in 2023. In 2024, they were the only company approved to send fresh pork to Singapore, bringing Taiwan pork back to Singapore after 15 years.

Mr. Chen explained that current Taiwanese slaughterhouses still use a lot of manual labor, unlike those in Europe and America. He believes that with Taiwan now free of major pig diseases, the industry must upgrade. He said that only about 20% of Taiwan's slaughtering process is automated, and there are not enough workers. He wants the new AI slaughterhouse to handle 450 pigs per hour, which is much faster than the current 200 pigs per hour. This will also make the process cleaner and more precise.

The new facility will use advanced technology for sorting meat, making soup from bones, and even extracting medical ingredients from organs. It will also be very green, saving water and electricity. For example, it will use solar power and special systems for waste. Mr. Chen also plans to open it as a "tourism factory" for education. He believes this AI slaughterhouse will help Taiwan's pork industry become a global leader.

Yunlin County produces a lot of pigs, about 1.6 million a year. The new slaughterhouse will be able to process 2 million pigs annually. This will help reduce the need to transport live pigs long distances, which is better for animal welfare and reduces disease risk.

Animal welfare groups have been asking for changes in how pigs are sold. They want pigs to go directly from farms to slaughterhouses instead of being sold at live auctions, which can be stressful and harmful for the animals. Mr. Chen's new slaughterhouse aims to support this change.

Mr. Chen has worked in the pig industry for 40 years. He is confident that Taiwan's pork will be a success both at home and abroad.

**Changing the Image of Pig Farms: Modern Farms Are Clean and Odor-Free**

<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506290104.aspx">News Link</a>

Taiwan's Ministry of Agriculture has been working hard to make pig farms better and cleaner. They want to change the old idea that pig farms are dirty and smelly. One farm in Changhua, Lifu Livestock Farm, has successfully changed and is now a good example. You can even talk comfortably in the windy area downwind from the farm, without any bad smell.

Pig farming is a very important part of Taiwan's agriculture. In 2023, it made 85.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is almost 40% of all livestock farming. The government wants to export more pork, but some people worry that there are not enough pigs to supply the market steadily.

Old pig farms often had problems with pollution, animal welfare, and not being efficient. To fix this, the Ministry of Agriculture started a big plan in 2021. It's called the "10 Billion Pig Fund" and has 8 parts. A lot of the money is used to upgrade pig farms and slaughterhouses.

The plan helps pig farms get money to build new, modern pig houses. For example, they can change old concrete floors to raised floors, which helps reduce smells and diseases. They can also change open pig houses to closed ones with special fans and water systems to control smells.

By the end of 2024, over 2,100 pig farms in Taiwan have started to upgrade, which is almost 40% of all farms. The Ministry of Agriculture will continue to help more farms change.

Lifu Livestock Farm in Changhua is a great example. It has new systems with AI to control temperature and humidity, smart feeders for pigs, and better ways to treat wastewater. This helps the farm save energy and is better for the animals.

Mr. Liu Yun-Fu, who runs Lifu Livestock Farm, has been in the pig business for 20 years. He said that old pig houses were hot and smelly, and needed a lot of workers. Now, with modern changes, his farm is more efficient, produces less carbon, and cares more for the animals.

At his farm, AI systems check the temperature, humidity, and airflow in the pig houses all the time. This saves work and helps manage the pigs better. Smart feeders allow mother pigs to eat whenever they want, which reduces their stress. The farm also uses special energy-saving fans and cooling systems to keep the pig houses at a comfortable temperature, even when it's hot outside.

The farm uses a special floor design that separates pig waste, which helps reduce smell and disease. They also have a three-step system to clean wastewater, and the treated water is used to water sugarcane fields, helping the environment.

Mr. Liu also uses UV lights to kill germs and keep the air clean. He is proud that even in the downwind area, there is no bad smell or dust. He also has a special freezer for dead pigs, which are regularly taken away, to prevent diseases from spreading to other farms.

With all these modern changes, Lifu Livestock Farm has healthy pigs and a high success rate for young pigs, about 95%. Mr. Liu believes that pig farming must keep changing and become more sustainable. He hopes Taiwan's pig industry can become known around the world for its quality.

**Taiwan's Fresh Pork Exports: Confidence in Quality, Worry About Stable Supply**

<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506290103.aspx">News Link</a>

In late May this year, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to be free of three major pig diseases: hog cholera, African swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease. This is a big step for Taiwan's pork exports, as the Ministry of Agriculture believes it will make Taiwan's pork much more competitive in international markets.

Pig farmers are happy about the quality of Taiwan's pork, but they are concerned about whether they can produce enough pigs to meet the demand for exports.

Taiwan was first certified free of foot-and-mouth disease in 2020. Then, after successfully preventing African swine fever, the Philippines and Singapore started importing fresh pork from Taiwan in 2023 and 2024. After Taiwan was declared free of hog cholera this May, the Philippines quickly allowed more types of Taiwan pork to be imported, including pig skin and internal organs. The Ministry of Agriculture is now working hard to restart fresh pork exports to Japan.

Mr. Chen Kuo-Hsun, chairman of Jia-Yi-Shiang, a company that has already successfully exported fresh pork to the Philippines and Singapore, is very positive about the Japanese market. He believes that Japanese consumers will soon be able to enjoy high-quality Taiwanese pork once the government finishes negotiations.

Mr. Chen explained that Taiwan's fresh pork will definitely be competitive in Japan. Currently, Japan imports frozen pork from Europe and America by sea, which takes about a month. Fresh pork would need to be sent by air, which is very expensive. However, Taiwan is close to Japan, so fresh pork can be sent by sea in just five days, and chilled pork tastes much better than frozen.

Different markets want different parts of the pig. For example, Japanese consumers like pork loin, while Singaporeans prefer pork ribs for their "Bak Kut Teh" soup. Filipinos enjoy fried pig skin as a snack, and Koreans like pork belly for barbecue.

Singkung Meat Products in Pingtung used to export chilled fresh pork to Japan before the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. Mr. Yang Min-Jui, a manager at Singkung, said that many pork exporters closed down after the disease. Singkung managed to survive by switching to producing cooked pork products for export to Japan.

Mr. Yang said that pork companies are very happy that Taiwan's fresh pork can now be exported again. However, there are still challenges. For example, Japan has already found other suppliers. Also, the Japanese Yen is weak, which makes imports more expensive for Japanese buyers. And right now, Taiwan's pork prices are quite high, making it hard to compete with other countries. A big problem is that Taiwan doesn't have enough pigs to meet its own needs, let alone export a lot.

Mr. Yang believes that the Japanese like Taiwan, so exporting to Japan again would be good for both sides. But he thinks the Taiwanese government needs to make sure pork prices are stable and that more pigs are raised. This will make Taiwan's pork more competitive.

For the future, Mr. Yang suggested that the government could help create a strong brand for Taiwan pork, like Spain's Iberico black pig, which sells for a high price because of its quality and story. Taiwan pork could also focus on quality and value instead of just price.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, before the foot-and-mouth disease in 1996, Taiwan had over 10 million pigs. This number has gone down steadily, to about 5.2 million pigs by the end of 2024.

Mr. Lin Cheng-Shiang from the Taiwan Frozen Meat Industry Association said that because there are not enough pigs, Taiwan can only meet about 90% of its own pork needs, and has to import the rest.

While expanding pork exports is good for the industry and could lead to selling high-quality pork, Mr. Lin said that to export more, Taiwan needs to raise more pigs. This is difficult now because of stricter environmental rules and fewer young people wanting to work in pig farming. Even though pig farms are much cleaner now, many people still don't want to live near them, so the industry might not return to its past size before the foot-and-mouth disease.`;
