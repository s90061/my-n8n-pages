            <h1>Typhoon Vipa Approaches: Kenting Beaches Closed, Dawu Mountain Trail Shut</h1>
            <p>The weather office has issued a sea warning for Typhoon Vipa. It is expected to be closest to the Hengchun Peninsula tonight and tomorrow. Today at noon, Kenting National Park Management Office closed all beaches in Kenting. No one is allowed to enter. They also told visitors not to go near the ocean to watch the waves, to keep themselves safe.</p>
            <p>According to the weather office, at 2 PM today, the center of Typhoon Vipa was about 500 kilometers south-southeast of Eluanbi. It was moving northwest at 23 kilometers per hour. It will be closest to the Hengchun Peninsula and other areas tonight and tomorrow. The waves at Nanwan Beach are getting stronger. By noon tomorrow, the waves are expected to be 2.7 meters high.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-shan, the deputy director of the Kenting National Park Management Office, told Central News Agency that after the sea warning was issued, all beaches were closed. He asked visitors not to go near the waves to stay safe.</p>
            <p>Because Kenting beaches are closed, visitors can only stand on the shore to look at the sea and take photos. A person named Cai from Hengchun said that after noon today, even though it was not raining in Kenting, the cloudy weather made it feel like a typhoon was coming. He hoped it would not rain too much.</p>
            <p>Also, the Pingtung Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency announced that because of Typhoon Vipa, the Dawu Mountain National Trail and Hui Gu Mountain Cabin will be closed from July 18 to July 20. For hikers who had booked to stay at Hui Gu Mountain Cabin during this time, they will get a full refund. (Editor: Hsieh Ya-chu) 1140718</p>

            <h1>QR Code Issue on Recall Vote Notices: New Taipei Election Commission Says It Was Removed After Asking for Instructions</h1>
            <p>The first round of recall votes for lawmakers will happen on July 26. Lawmaker Chang Chia-ling said that the New Taipei City Election Commission said yesterday that the QR code on the voting notice was printed wrong. But today, when she scanned it, it went to the correct link. The New Taipei City Election Commission replied that they had to remove the QR code after asking the Central Election Commission.</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-ling, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party in New Taipei City, said on Facebook yesterday that the New Taipei City Election Commission had told civil affairs staff the day before to take apart all the wrongly printed voting notices so the Election Commission could collect them.</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-ling told Central News Agency that the QR code on the voting notice was printed incorrectly. But because the notices had already been sent to district offices, the staff had to quickly take them apart so the New Taipei City Election Commission could collect them. She said this was a big mistake in the election process and wasted public money.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Election Commission said in a message yesterday afternoon that during the printing of the recall notices, they found a mistake when testing. They corrected it right away, and the delivery of the notices would happen on time.</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-ling posted again today, saying that the New Taipei City Election Commission said the "printing mistake" was because the QR code was accidentally linked to the 2024 presidential and lawmaker election inquiry website, as the QR code function was not supposed to be open for this recall vote. But when she scanned the QR code on the voting notices that were supposed to be collected and destroyed, it linked correctly to the polling station inquiry page for this recall case.</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-ling asked, "Are the voting notices that New Taipei citizens received the original ones that were supposed to be collected and destroyed? Or are they newly printed notices? If there was no mistake, why did they ask to collect and destroy them? This made all the civil affairs staff very busy!"</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Election Commission explained in a message that the Ministry of the Interior has two systems for checking polling stations: one by ID number and one by household and neighborhood. For this recall vote, the system to check polling stations by ID number and its QR code function were not open. After asking the Central Election Commission, they had to remove that QR code, so they printed new notices.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Election Commission said that all the voting notices and recall announcements for the New Taipei City lawmaker recall case have been printed. Currently, district offices are sending them to homes. They will be delivered by July 22, as planned. (Editors: Chang Ming-kun, Lin Shu-hui) 1140718</p>

            <p>You can check your payment status online two hours after you pay (for convenience store payments, it takes 3 business days, not including holidays). The Joint Committee of Technical and Vocational College Admissions reminds students, whether they pay individually or as part of a group, to check their payment status during the payment period.
