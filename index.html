            <h1>McKinsey Report: China's Rare Earth Controls Could Affect Millions of German Jobs</h1>
            <p>A new study by the consulting company McKinsey shows that about one million workers in Germany work in industries that need rare earth materials a lot. These industries include making cars, producing energy, and making airplanes. If China stops providing these materials, up to 4 million direct and indirect jobs could be at risk. This also means about 370 billion euros worth of products could be in danger, which is 9% of Germany's total economic output.</p>
            <p>On October 9th, China said that from now on, any export of technology for mining and processing rare earths must get approval first. This makes it harder to export these materials. The world relies heavily on China for rare earths. As trade tensions between the US and China continue, Beijing's changes to its rare earth policy also worry German industries.</p>
            <p>According to an internal McKinsey report seen by the German business newspaper "Handelsblatt," industries that use rare earths in their production, like car manufacturing, renewable energy equipment, semiconductors, machines, and aerospace, contribute about 150 billion euros to Germany's economy each year. This also supports about 3 million indirect workers.</p>
            <p>If China limits rare earth exports, the total direct and indirect impact could be 370 billion euros. This is about 9% of Germany's total economic output (GDP). It would hurt jobs and Germany's main industries.</p>
            <p>Cornelius BÃ¤hr, an expert from the German Economic Institute (IW), said that McKinsey's numbers are reasonable. Earlier research by IW showed that about 1.3 million workers in Germany make products that contain rare earths. If the supply stops, it would greatly affect jobs.</p>
            <p>Christian Hoffmann, a partner at McKinsey's German office, told Handelsblatt that in the past, industries mainly worried about how raw material prices changed. But now, it's more important if there is enough supply to continue production.</p>
            <p>For example, Germanium is an important material used to make fiber optics, semiconductors, and military equipment. At the end of last year, China stopped exporting it to the US and greatly reduced its supply to the European Union. Because of this, Europe's imports in the first half of this year were almost 60% less than the same time last year. Some raw material companies said that European businesses first thought the risk was not so big. But now, "the market is in a panic, and industries are shocked."</p>
            <p>Hoffmann pointed out that Germany has tried many times in recent years to make sure it has enough key raw materials. But every time the market became stable for a short time, these plans were put aside. He said that many businesses only recently understood that having a secure supply of raw materials needs a long-term plan.</p>
            <p>Hoffmann praised the "Raw Material Fund" plan that the government set up last year. He thinks it is the right way to help businesses find new sources of rare earths outside of China.</p>
            <p>This fund will be managed by Germany's state-owned KfW bank. It will lower risks for businesses and encourage investment. The government will also help cover the extra costs. This will make China's cheap rare earths less competitive.</p>
            <p>Hoffmann suggested that different industries should work together. Manufacturers, mining companies, universities, banks, and private investment funds should all take part. They should create a complete supply chain from getting raw materials, processing them, to storing them. They could also form special buying groups or trade platforms. This would make them stronger when talking about prices in the international raw materials market. This would further protect German jobs and the future of its industries.</p>

            <h1>Trump Goes to Middle East for Gaza Peace Summit, Says War is Over Three Times</h1>
            <p>Since becoming president, Trump has worked hard to stop wars. Today, as he flew to the Middle East, he said three times, "The war (in Gaza) is over." He also believes the ceasefire will continue. He is going to Egypt to lead a "Peace Summit." He hopes to end the cruel war that has lasted for two years.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, on Air Force One, US President Donald Trump told reporters, "All these countries support this (peace) agreement. Everyone supports it. This has never happened before." When a reporter asked if he was sure the fight between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas was over, Trump said, "The war is over. Do you understand?"</p>
            <p>Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, starting a new war between Israel and Hamas. Numbers show that over 67,000 Palestinians have died in the war. On October 8th, Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first part of his Gaza peace plan. He called it a "historic and never-before-seen" step.</p>
            <p>The next day, he said, "We have made sure all remaining hostages will be set free. They should be released on Monday (the 13th) or Tuesday (the 14th)." But he also admitted that it would be "hard to find" the bodies of some hostages who died.</p>
            <p>According to the ceasefire agreement made by Israel and Hamas recently, Israel should release 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 Gaza residents who were held. Hamas, in return, should release the remaining 47 hostages taken during the attack across the border on October 7, 2023, whether they are alive or dead.</p>
            <p>However, Trump shared few details about the second part of the peace agreement and what will happen in Gaza in the future.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "There will be disarming, there will be troop withdrawal." This seemed to mean that Israel wants Hamas to give up its weapons, and Hamas wants Israel to take its soldiers away. But Trump did not explain more.</p>
            <p>According to the White House schedule, Trump is expected to arrive in Israel tomorrow morning. He will meet with the families of the hostages and give a speech in the Israeli Parliament (Knesset).</p>
            <p>On October 13th, he and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will lead the Gaza Peace Summit together in Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort by the Red Sea. More than 20 leaders from different countries are expected to be there.</p>
            <p>It is still not clear if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will attend. Hamas has already said it will not take part.</p>

            <h1>US Senate Passes Defense Bill, Invites Taiwan to RIMPAC Drills, Gives $1 Billion in Military Aid</h1>
            <p>The US Senate has passed its yearly defense bill. It "strongly suggests" inviting Taiwan to join the RIMPAC military exercises and to work together on developing and making drones. The full text of the approved bill is not yet public. However, congressional staff told Central News Agency today that the part about giving Taiwan $1 billion (about 30.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars) in military aid will stay in the bill.</p>
            <p>After many hours of voting on October 9th, the Senate passed the big yearly "National Defense Authorization Act" (NDAA) late at night. The vote was 77 to 20. This bill allows for about $925 billion in military spending. A staff member for Democratic Senator Jacky Rosen said that the bill includes military aid for Taiwan under the "Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative."</p>
            <p>The bill also "strongly encourages" the Secretary of Defense to invite the Taiwan Navy to join the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) military exercises when it is right to do so. If the Secretary of Defense decides not to invite them, he must explain why.</p>
            <p>The RIMPAC military exercises are led by the US military. They happen every two years and are the world's biggest international naval exercises. Through these drills, the US military helps armed forces in the Pacific region work better together. The US Navy has said that RIMPAC is a special chance to train. It helps participating countries stay friends and work together, which is very important for keeping sea routes safe.</p>
            <p>Besides the Taiwan Navy joining the RIMPAC exercises, the bill also tells the Department of Defense to work with Taiwan to make a joint plan. This plan is for developing and making drones and anti-drone technology together. It also says to check Taiwan's important digital systems and suggest ways to make them stronger.</p>
            <p>The bill says that for countries like Israel, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and NATO members, the Secretary of Defense can set an order of importance for defense supplies using the Defense Priorities and Allocations System.</p>
            <p>For the defense industry partnership between the US and Taiwan, the bill says that the Secretary of Defense should create a partnership between the Department of Defense's "Defense Innovation Unit" and the right groups in Taiwan. This will give US and Taiwan defense technology companies more chances to sell their products and make Taiwan's defense industry stronger.</p>
            <p>Congress has always been a strong supporter of Taiwan in the US. The Senate's version of the "National Defense Authorization Act" clearly shows that lawmakers are working to help Taiwan's defense in several ways.</p>
            <p>For example, the bill states that the office of the Secretary of Defense must first provide a "Taiwan Security Assistance Roadmap." This is a plan for several years that aims to meet the defense needs of Taiwan's military. It also needs a report about possibly creating a "regional readiness stockpile" to help Taiwan. If these are not provided, only some travel money can be used.</p>
            <p>Also, on October 9th, Republican Senator Dave McCormick said in a statement that this year's "National Defense Authorization Act" also includes the "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act." This part strongly supports Taiwan joining the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
            <p>The House of Representatives already passed its own "National Defense Authorization Act" in September. Because the two versions are different, they will talk to agree on a final version with the same words. After both houses vote again and pass it, it will be sent to the White House for the President to sign into law.</p>
            <p>According to US law, after the defense authorization bill becomes a law, the money will only be available after it is included in an appropriation bill. In other words, the defense authorization bill gives the government permission to decide "how to use money." The exact amount of money to be used later will depend on the agreement reached by the two political parties on the appropriation bill.</p>
