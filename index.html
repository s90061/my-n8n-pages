            <h1>Naomi Osaka Beats Coco Gauff at US Open, Moves to Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>On September 1st, Japanese player Naomi Osaka beat Coco Gauff from the US. Osaka won 6-3, 6-2 and is now in the quarterfinals of the US Open women's singles.</p>
            <p>Naomi Osaka won the US Open in 2018 and 2020. Coco Gauff won the US Open in 2023.</p>
            <p>Osaka, who is the 23rd seed in the tournament, won against Gauff, the 3rd seed, in just 1 hour and 4 minutes. She also beat Gauff in their first match at the US Open in 2019, when Gauff was only 15 years old.</p>
            <p>Gauff changed her coach before this year's US Open to improve her serves. But in this match, she had problems again and made 5 double faults. Gauff made 33 unforced errors, which is much more than Osaka's 12 errors.</p>
            <p>After the match, Osaka said, "I feel a bit emotional, I don't want to cry."</p>
            <p>She also said, "I really enjoy my time here. This is my favorite court in the whole world, and it means a lot to me to be back here."</p>
            <p>Osaka's performance at this US Open is her best in a Grand Slam singles match since she had her baby in 2023 and returned to playing tennis the following year.</p>
            <p>Next, Osaka will play against Karolina Muchova from the Czech Republic. Muchova reached the quarterfinals by beating Marta Kostyuk from Ukraine with scores of 6-3, 6-7 (0/7), 6-3.</p>

            <h1>Iga Swiatek Wins Easily and Moves to US Open Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>On September 1st, Polish tennis star Iga Swiatek won her fourth-round match at the US Open women's singles. She beat Ekaterina Alexandrova from Russia, the 13th seed, in two sets: 6-3, 6-1. This win means Swiatek is now in the quarterfinals of the US Open.</p>
            <p>Swiatek, who is the 2nd seed in this year's US Open, took about 1 hour to beat Alexandrova. Because of this win, she has reached at least the quarterfinals in all four Grand Slam tournaments this year.</p>
            <p>The first set was very close at the start, with the score tied at 3-3. But then Swiatek won the 7th game, and then won two more games in a row to take the first set.</p>
            <p>In the second set, Swiatek kept playing well and did not let her opponent score many points. She easily won the second set 6-1, which meant Alexandrova was out of the tournament.</p>
            <p>Even though Swiatek has won 4 of her 6 Grand Slam titles on the clay courts of the French Open, this win today shows that she plays very well on all types of courts.</p>
            <p>Swiatek, who is 24 years old, was happy with her performance after the match. She said, "Things are different every month. As long as I feel good about my game and have a good mindset, I can handle any court."</p>
            <p>In the US Open women's singles quarterfinals, Swiatek will play against the winner of the match between Amanda Anisimova from the US and Beatriz Haddad Maia from Brazil.</p>
