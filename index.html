            <h1>Nanto Cat Luo River Water Rises; Hsu Shu-Hua Asks People to Move Cars from Low Areas</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Cheng Wei-chen, Nantou, August 3) For many days, it has rained in Nantou County. Many places have loose soil and falling rocks. At 13.4 kilometers on County Road 54, the road is damaged and might collapse, so it is now closed. People traveling between Jiji and Shuili can use Provincial Highway 16 instead. The water level of the Caoluo River is getting higher. People are asked to move their cars from low-lying areas.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration said that because of strong winds from the southwest, there will be short periods of heavy rain. Today, some mountain areas in Nantou County will have very heavy or extremely heavy rain. Some areas in Nantou County will have heavy or very heavy rain. The rain forecast at 10 AM said that Nantou mountain areas might get 100 to 190 millimeters of rain in the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p>Nantou County Mayor Hsu Shu-hua said on Facebook in the morning that the Caoluo River's water level is now high. She has asked the Nantou City Office to tell village leaders to announce more often for people to move cars from under bridges and from low areas. They have also put up warning lines, and water pumps are still working.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-hua also said that there are falling rocks at 28 kilometers on County Road 89. The Alishan Highway has landslides and cannot be used. They have asked a contractor to help clear the road.</p>
            <p>The Jiji Township Office said that at 13.4 kilometers on County Road 54, before Pujih Bridge, the road has big cracks and has sunk. It could fall apart at any time. This part of the road is now closed. People going from Shuili to Jiji can use Provincial Highway 16. However, at 12 kilometers on Provincial Highway 16, a hillside fell a few days ago, so only one way is open for traffic.</p>

            <h1>Experts: Kang Ding Warships Get New Missile System and Radar; Can See Farther, Attack Faster</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Yu Kai-hsiang, Taipei, August 3) Taiwan's navy has updated its Kang Ding class frigates. They now have a new missile system called Huayang Vertical Launch System, made by CSIST, and Sea Sword II missiles. Experts said today that the Sea Sword II missiles can fly much farther than the old Sea Chaparral missiles. Also, the new launch system does not need to move up, down, left, or right to aim. It can fire missiles very fast, one after another. The updated spinning radar gives a 3D picture of the battle. This means it can see far, be very exact, and react quickly.</p>
            <p>To make its fighting power stronger, the navy has put aside NT$43.1599 billion from 2022 to 2030. This money will be used to improve the fighting systems of six Kang Ding class frigates (also known as La Fayette class ships) in the 124th Fleet. The first ship to be updated, the Chen De, left port for sea tests on the morning of July 28. It should finish its upgrade and be ready for service again by the end of this year. Starting next year, one ship will be updated each year until all are done, making the navy stronger.</p>
            <p>The upgrades for the Kang Ding class ships include anti-air missiles, battle control systems, detection systems, towed sonars, and missile systems. For the missile system, the ships used to have Sea Chaparral short-range anti-air missiles. After the upgrade, they will have the "Huayang" Vertical Launch System (VLS), which was developed by CSIST. This system will carry 32 Sea Sword II (TC-2N) anti-air missiles.</p>
            <p>The Vertical Launch System at the front of the ship has 8 parts. Each part can hold 4 Sea Sword II missiles. Su Tzu-yun, an expert from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said that the Sea Chaparral missiles could only fly about 8 kilometers. But the Sea Sword II missiles can fly about 30 to 40 kilometers. Also, there are more of them, and they launch faster. When fighting, the new missiles do not need to move up, down, left, or right like the old ones. They can launch instantly and then turn towards the target. They can even fire many times quickly. This makes them much better than the Sea Chaparral.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kang Ding ships have new Type 997 spinning radar systems from BAE Systems in the UK. This makes them much better at finding things. Su Tzu-yun said that the old radar on the Kang Ding ships was 2D. But the new radar is 3D. This means it can find targets, their distance, and their height. This gives the Kang Ding ships a 3D view of the battle. Also, public information shows it can "lock on and track" more than 200 targets at the same time. This means it can see farther, be more exact, and react much faster.</p>
            <p>The original Kang Ding class frigates are based on the La Fayette class frigates from the French Navy. They belong to the 124th Fleet of Taiwan's navy. Their home port is Zuoying Naval Base. Their main jobs are to defend the Taiwan Strait from air attacks, find and attack submarines, protect other ships, stop blockades, and work with other ships to stop enemies on the water. There are 6 ships in total: Kang Ding (PFG-1202), Hsi Ning (PFG-1203), Kun Ming (PFG-1205), Di Hua (PFG-1206), Wu Chang (PFG-1207), and Chen De (PFG-1208).</p>

            <h1>Guangxi Mercedes Driver Shows ID to Force Way; Special Privilege Display Causes Public Anger Across Nation</h1>
            <p>(CNA Taipei, August 3) A man in Guangxi recently posted a video. He said that a woman driving a Mercedes-Benz showed an ID card and told him to let her pass. She also seemed to know his personal information. He thought a public official was using their power wrongly. Today, officials shared their investigation results. They said the woman used her husband's ID card, which was for administrative law enforcement, to scare the man. News reports said that showing "special privilege" like this is too much. A small argument became a big public issue across the country.</p>
            <p>On July 22, Mr. Li was driving in Fangchenggang City, Guangxi, when he met a Mercedes-Benz car. The woman driving the Mercedes showed an ID card that said "Administrative Law Enforcement" and forced him to let her pass. The man in the car with her (who was the woman's father) even used his car license plate to say his home address and last name out loud, which is private information.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li thought a public official was using their power to get his personal information. He was very angry and complained. But the police did not come to help. So, he put the video online. More than ten million people watched it.</p>
            <p>On July 31, police officers from the local station came to his home late at night. They said the videos showed the woman's car license plate and shared her private information. They asked him to delete the videos and say sorry. He deleted the first video. Then he posted it again with parts covered, and it got a lot of attention again.</p>
            <p>At first, the police said it was "not suitable to say" if the woman was a public official. Later, because many people were talking about it, they changed their statement. They announced that they had formed a team to look into the matter.</p>
            <p>Today, the investigation team from the Fangchenggang City Committee and City Government in Guangxi shared their findings about the whole event. They said the 28-year-old woman driving the Mercedes, whose last name is Hou, is not a public official herself. Her husband is a Level 2 firefighter at a fire station in Shangsi County, Fangchenggang City. The "administrative law enforcement ID" that Ms. Hou showed belonged to her husband. She showed it to scare Mr. Li.</p>
            <p>The police are now looking into the bad effects Ms. Hou's actions had after they were shown online. They are dealing with it by law. Her husband, Mr. Li, did not keep his ID card safely. This led to his ID being used wrongly. He might have broken work rules. The Fangchenggang City Fire Rescue Detachment has started an investigation into him.</p>
            <p>About Mr. Li thinking his personal information was shared, the report said this: Ms. Hou's family lives close to Mr. Li's parents' home, and they know each other. But Mr. Li has worked in other places for many years and did not know this. When the driving problem happened, Ms. Hou's father, who was in the car with her, got out to talk. He recognized Mr. Li. That is why he said information like Mr. Li's home address at that time.</p>
            <p>The report made it clear that Ms. Hou and her father do not have "police communication devices" or other tools that police or legal departments use to find people's information. So, they did not look up Mr. Li's personal information at the scene.</p>
            <p>Today, a Chinese news outlet, The Paper, said that an administrative law enforcement ID card, held by a Level 2 firefighter at a small town's fire station, could be used by his wife to scare other people. This shows that the idea of "showing off special power" still exists in some areas, and it is very strong. It means "even a little bit of power is used to the fullest."</p>
            <p>This event also makes people wonder if the police handled the situation and talked to everyone in the right way. The news report said that in today's time of social media, showing off "special privilege" like this gets much bigger when people all over the country pay attention. Then it becomes a national public event. This has a very bad effect on the local area's image. This is a big lesson from this event.</p>
