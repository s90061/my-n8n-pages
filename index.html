            <h1>US Envoy Says Putin Agrees to Let US Give Security Guarantees to Ukraine</h1>
            <p>Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for US President Trump, told CNN today that Russian President Putin agreed to let the United States give "strong security guarantees" to Ukraine. This agreement happened during a meeting between Putin and Trump. It is part of a possible peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Witkoff told Jake Tapper, the host of CNN's "State of the Union" show, "We agreed on strong security guarantees. I would say this can change the situation."</p>
            <p>Also, Witkoff said these security guarantees are like the protection in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This is to stop Russia from invading more in the future.</p>
            <p>He also said that Vladimir Putin agreed to "write into law" that Russia will not go into any land in Ukraine or other parts of Europe. This is also part of the possible peace agreement.</p>

            <h1>British Actor Terence Stamp, Who Played General Zod in Superman Movies, Has Died</h1>
            <p>Terence Stamp, an experienced British actor, died today at 87 years old. Many people knew him for playing General Zod, a main bad guy, in the popular Hollywood movies "Superman" and "Superman II."</p>
            <p>Terence Stamp's family told Reuters in a statement that he passed away this morning. The statement said, "He left behind many great works. As an actor and a writer, he will continue to move and inspire people for many years."</p>
            <p>Reports say that Terence Stamp was born in 1938 in the East End of London, UK. During World War II, he lived through the bombing of London. After leaving school, he first worked in advertising. Later, he got a scholarship to study acting in a special school.</p>
            <p>He was nominated for an Oscar award. He acted in movies like "Theorem" in 1968, "A Season in Hell" in 1971, and "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" in 1994.</p>
            <p>Also, Terence Stamp tried to become the next James Bond, the secret agent 007, after Sean Connery. But he did not get the part.</p>
            <p>Terence Stamp played General Zod, the main bad guy, in the 1978 movie "Superman" and the 1980 movie "Superman II." Christopher Reeve was the main actor in these films.</p>
            <p>Before he died, he also acted in other movies and TV shows. These include "Valkyrie" in 2008, starring Tom Cruise, and "The Adjustment Bureau" in 2011, starring Matt Damon.</p>

            <h1>European Leaders Go with Zelenskyy to the US in a Big Group, BBC Says It's New</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy will go to Washington D.C. to talk with US President Trump. Leaders from Europe and NATO will go with him. The BBC says this has never happened before. It seems that European leaders are a bit worried after the US-Russia meeting.</p>
            <p>The United States wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly. Because of this strong pressure, Volodymyr Zelenskyy will fly to Washington tomorrow. He will try to protect Kyiv's interests. He will also try hard to avoid problems with Donald Trump at the White House again.</p>
            <p>Today, many leaders said they will go with Zelenskyy. They are German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
            <p>At first, it was just going to be a meeting between two people. Now, it seems much bigger. But Trump and Zelenskyy might still have a private talk.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that this meeting is new and has not happened before. It is hard to imagine so many European leaders saying they would fly across the Atlantic Ocean to talk about one issue in such a short time.</p>
            <p>After Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a meeting in Alaska, USA, European leaders seemed a bit worried.</p>
            <p>Their main goal now is to make sure Ukraine gets security guarantees after a peace deal is made between Russia and Ukraine. European leaders also want to talk to Trump about Ukraine's land. They want to show that they will keep supporting Ukraine.</p>
            <p>In February this year, Trump and US Vice President JD Vance publicly criticized Zelenskyy in the Oval Office at the White House. This surprised people all over the world.</p>
            <p>At that time, Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House. It was hard to think that their relationship could get better. But in the next few months, European leaders worked behind the scenes to fix things. Leaders who had a good relationship with Trump tried to make Trump like Zelenskyy for him.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy learned how to give compliments to Trump and how to talk like he was making a business deal.</p>
            <p>In April this year, Ukraine and the US signed an agreement about minerals. Trump and Zelenskyy also had a private talk in the Vatican. Ukraine clearly said they were ready to pay for US weapons.</p>
            <p>In July, Trump and Zelenskyy talked on the phone. Zelenskyy said it was "the best conversation we've ever had."</p>
            <p>People still think that Trump is easily influenced by flattery and likes strong leaders. So, Ukraine is still worried about Putin's influence on him.</p>
            <p>But Zelenskyy keeps learning. Before the meeting in the Oval Office on the 18th, he has European friends who can help him. Merz said about this, "We will give some good advice."</p>
            <p>The BBC pointed out that Keir Starmer will also play a big part in helping Zelenskyy talk with Trump.</p>
            <p>Starmer has worked hard to keep a good relationship with Trump. When Starmer visited the White House in February and when Trump recently visited Scotland, the atmosphere was friendly. He and Stubb might be the European leaders closest to Trump.</p>
            <p>The British Prime Minister's office believes that Starmer's presence at these events can help a lot. He can be a middleman between Trump and Zelenskyy.</p>
