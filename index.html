        const text = `**AI is Changing How We Work, Companies Say**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the way many companies do business. New AI tools, like those that can write text or create images, are becoming common in offices. This means that some daily tasks that workers used to do might now be done by machines. Businesses hope that AI will make them more efficient and help them create new products and services faster.

However, this change also brings challenges. Some people are worried that AI could cause job losses. Companies are investing a lot of money in this new technology, and employees are being asked to learn new skills. This "upskilling" is important so workers can use AI tools effectively and take on new roles that machines cannot do. Experts believe that AI will not just replace jobs, but rather change them, creating a need for human workers who can manage and work with AI.

**Extreme Heat Affecting Travel and Daily Life in Europe**

Parts of southern Europe are experiencing very hot summer weather, with temperatures reaching record highs. This extreme heat is caused by climate change and is having a big effect on daily life and the tourism industry. Popular travel destinations are seeing fewer visitors who want to avoid the scorching sun. Many outdoor activities, like sightseeing tours or beach trips, are becoming difficult or even dangerous.

Businesses are trying to adapt to these conditions. Some restaurants are opening later in the evening when it is cooler, and shops are offering more cooling products. Outdoor workers, like construction workers or farmers, are facing serious health risks and often have to change their working hours. Local authorities are also warning people to stay hydrated and avoid the hottest parts of the day. The heatwave is a clear example of how changing global temperatures are impacting both the economy and people's health.

**The Rise of Digital Nomads: Working from Anywhere**

The way people work is changing, and more individuals are choosing to become "digital nomads." These are people who use technology to work remotely from different countries or cities, often traveling for long periods. This trend has grown rapidly since the pandemic, as many companies now allow their employees to work from home. This flexibility means people can combine their jobs with exploring new cultures and places.

Seeing this growing trend, many countries are now offering special visas specifically for digital nomads. These visas make it easier for remote workers to live and work legally in a foreign country for several months or even years. Countries hope that attracting digital nomads will boost their local economies, as these workers spend money on housing, food, and entertainment. This new way of working is creating exciting opportunities for travel and cultural exchange, but it also brings new challenges for communities to adapt to a changing population.`;
