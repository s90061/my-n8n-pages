            <h1>Iran's Money Becomes Less Valuable as It Says No to Nuclear Talks with the US</h1>
            <p>Before Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke at the United Nations meeting, the value of Iran's money, called the rial, went down again today. One US dollar is now worth 1,074,000 rials. This is the lowest it has ever been.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press news agency reported that the rial's value fell a lot because Iran's top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said he would not talk directly with the United States about its nuclear plans. This decision by Khamenei might make it harder for President Pezeshkian and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to have diplomatic talks in New York.</p>
            <p>The big drop in the rial's value also shows that recent talks between Iran and European countries might not stop the United Nations from putting more punishments on Iran for its nuclear program. A 30-day period before these punishments start will end on September 28.</p>

            <h1>Mata'an Stream Barrier Lake Overflows, Forestry Bureau Sent 7 Red Warnings to Hualien County Government</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a natural barrier lake in Mata'an Stream, Hualien, overflowed. This caused serious damage in Guangfu Township. Some people complained that they did not get a warning to leave their homes. The Forestry Bureau's records show that they talked with the Hualien County Government in August about moving people. Yesterday, they sent 7 red alert notices to the Hualien County Government.</p>
            <p>Today, the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture posted its response records for the Mata'an barrier lake on Facebook. Starting from midnight on September 23, they sent 7 red alert notices to the Hualien County Government. At 6 AM, they sent mobile phone alerts to tell people to find a safe place. After the barrier lake overflowed at 2:50 PM, they sent more mobile phone alerts at 3 PM and 4:30 PM, asking people to leave quickly.</p>
            <p>According to the Forestry Bureau's records, on July 26, the Hualien branch created a special team for the barrier lake. They checked the situation and warned people living downstream about possible danger. After that, they used drones to take pictures, checked the risks, and made a system to give warnings. On August 7, they met with the Hualien County Government to plan how to move people and what to do in an emergency.</p>
            <p>At 11 AM on September 21, the Forestry Bureau first sent a yellow warning and mobile phone alerts about the Mata'an Stream barrier lake. They told people to follow government instructions for safety. At 7 AM on September 22, they sent a red warning. They also sent mobile phone alerts at 7 AM, 9 AM, and 12:30 PM, telling people to follow government instructions for safety.</p>
            <p>The Forestry Bureau said that the amount of earth that formed the barrier lake was huge, about 200 million cubic meters. It created a long wall, 2300 meters long. Based on calculations, there was no immediate danger of the wall breaking before the water overflowed. But once the water started to flow over, the water could wash away the wall and cause it to break faster. So, they planned for four possible situations that could damage the wall: natural overflow, overflow caused by a typhoon or heavy rain, an earthquake stronger than 5.0, or water seeping through the wall. They made plans for warnings and telling people to move.</p>
            <p>The Forestry Bureau also said that the barrier lake is in a deep valley in a faraway mountain area. There are no roads, not even paths for people to walk on. So, it was not possible to bring in heavy construction machines. Workers had to be taken by helicopter from the National Airborne Service Corps. This allowed them to quickly install water level sensors on the wall. Also, the slopes of the barrier lake continued to have landslides, so staying there for too long was dangerous for the workers.</p>
            <p>The Forestry Bureau stated that since July 26, they have flown drones 17 times to take pictures. They calculated how much water the barrier lake held and how fast the water level was rising. Experts guessed that even without more typhoons or heavy rain, if only normal rain fell, the barrier lake would overflow naturally by early October. In the two months before the overflow, it was not possible to change the barrier lake using engineering methods, both because of the technical difficulty and the short time. So, before the overflow, they could only work with others to clean the river downstream, fix gaps in the riverbanks, and strengthen the Mata'an Bridge supports.</p>
