            <h1>Reuters: US and Japanese officials are planning for Trump to visit Japan next month</h1>
            <p>News from Washington/Tokyo, September 24 (Reuters) - Two government officials and one person who knows about the matter said that officials from the United States and Japan are planning for US President Trump to visit Japan next month.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this visit comes as the two countries are still talking about how to put their tariff agreement into action. Japan is one of America's closest friends in East Asia and an important partner for trade and safety issues.</p>
            <p>This also means that Trump, who is a Republican, will have his first chance to meet the new Prime Minister of Japan after Shigeru Ishiba. Ishiba is expected to leave his position in October.</p>
            <p>Officials said that the plans are not final until an official announcement is made, and the plans could still change.</p>
            <p>The White House and Japan's Foreign Ministry did not immediately answer when asked for comments.</p>

            <h1>Bloomberg: Intel seeks Apple investment to help revive chip business</h1>
            <p>News from Los Angeles, September 24 (Bloomberg) - Bloomberg News reported today, citing sources, that the American chip company Intel has talked to Apple to ask for investment. This is to help Intel make its chip business strong again.</p>
            <p>People who know about it, but did not want to be named, told Bloomberg that Intel and Apple have discussed how to work together more. These talks are still at an early stage, and they might not reach an agreement. Intel has also contacted other companies to look for possible investments and partnerships.</p>
            <p>Nvidia, a very big company that makes AI chips, announced last week that it will invest 5 billion US dollars in Intel. They plan to work together to make chips for personal computers and data centers.</p>
            <p>SoftBank Group Corp., a Japanese company that invests in technology, announced last month that it will invest 2 billion US dollars to buy shares in Intel. This is to grow its business in the United States. The US government has also bought shares in Intel and owns about 10% of the company.</p>
            <p>After Bloomberg shared this news, Intel's stock price went up by 6.4%, reaching 31.22 US dollars per share. Apple's stock price went down a little, to 252.31 US dollars per share.</p>
