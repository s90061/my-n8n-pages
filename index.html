            <h1>Hyundai Korean Workers Arrested: May Affect Future Investment</h1>
            <p>Hundreds of Korean citizens arrested during immigration raids in the United States left the country by plane today. The government in Seoul has warned that this event was "overwhelming" and might make future investors less willing to invest.</p>
            <p>On September 4, American immigration officers raided a Hyundai-LG battery factory in Georgia. They arrested 475 people for breaking immigration laws. More than 300 of these people were Koreans who were thought to be working illegally in the US.</p>
            <p>After Korea said the problem was solved, a special Korean Air Boeing 747-8I plane was seen leaving Atlanta. South Korea's Yonhap News Agency showed pictures of the workers smiling and waving as they got into cars to leave.</p>
            <p>Korea is a strong security partner and a main investor for the US. Its top companies invest billions of dollars to build factories and facilities in the US.</p>
            <p>Korean President Lee Jae-myung called the raids "overwhelming." He said they could make companies less likely to invest in the future. He blamed the raids on "cultural differences." He explained that in Korea, Americans teaching English with tourist visas is not seen as a "serious crime."</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-myung said that after the workers were arrested, Korean companies would surely wonder if it was worth the risk to set up factories in the US. He added, "This could greatly affect future investment choices, especially when thinking about doing business directly in the US."</p>
            <p>Many Korean companies send their own staff during new projects. People in the industry told AFP that it is common practice to use different visas to bring in skilled workers and avoid project delays.</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-myung stated that for Korean companies, "when setting up new facilities, equipment, and factories, skilled workers are essential. There must be people to install machines, and the US does not have enough local workers for this." He said that companies have always used short-term engineers to train local workers, "but now, even this basic need is being denied."</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-myung pointed out that Seoul is talking with Washington "to make sure that visas for investment are issued properly." This could include "asking for more visas" or even creating new types of visas. He believes that "the US will find a solution."</p>
            <p>"But in the current situation, Korean companies might hesitate to invest directly in the US."</p>
            <p>Professor Kim Dae-jong from Sejong University told AFP that the raids show the Trump government did not understand what was most important. He said they "actively brought in many large factories, but did not pay attention to training local workers."</p>
            <p>Professor Cho Dong-geun, an honorary economics professor at Myongji University, said that Korean companies already knew about these visa problems.</p>
            <p>"It is a shame that action against President Trump's anti-immigration policies did not happen sooner. Something should have been done long ago."</p>

            <h1>Chiu Tai-San Meets US Lawmakers to Explain Chinese United Front's False Information Campaigns</h1>
            <p>Chiu Tai-San, the head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), is visiting Washington D.C. He met with members from both political parties of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. He will also speak at a think tank. The committee shared photos of the meeting yesterday. Chairman John Moolenaar said in a statement that they talked about how to fight against China's false information and united front actions.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the US House Select Committee on China posted several photos on its social media account X. The photos showed meetings with a Taiwanese group at Congress. Those present included Chiu Tai-San, Taiwan's representative to the US, Alexander Yui, and Representatives Rob Wittman, Nathaniel Moran, and Jill Tokuda.</p>
            <p>Representative Moran posted on X that China's United Front Work Department is working harder to hurt freedom and spread false information. He said, "We listened directly to Chairman Chiu Tai-San of Taiwan at the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. We learned how Taiwan strongly defends itself against these threats and keeps freedom in the Taiwan Strait."</p>
            <p>Committee Chairman John Moolenaar said in a statement that they had good meetings. They discussed how to fight China's false information and united front actions. They also talked about how to make the security and economic relationship between the US and Taiwan stronger. The committee is united in supporting Taiwan's democracy and freedom.</p>
            <p>Moolenaar, who strongly opposes China, was recently pretended to be by Chinese hackers. These hackers sent emails to trusted contacts, trying to trick them into opening attachments and links. This was to allow the hackers to get their information during high-level US-China trade talks, without the victims knowing.</p>
            <p>After careful technical analysis, the committee confirmed that the hackers created hidden ways to secretly steal sensitive information directly to their own servers. This is a common sign of spying done by a country.</p>
            <p>On September 8, Moolenaar said that this is another example of China's aggressive cyber attacks. He said these attacks aim "to steal US strategies and use them against Congress, the government, and the American people." He added, "We will not be scared. We will continue to work to keep America safe."</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, Chiu Tai-San will speak at The Heritage Foundation. His speech will be about "Maintaining the Peace and Stability in the Taiwan Strait is in the Shared Interest of Taiwan and the US." Former US Vice President's Deputy National Security Advisor, Steve Yates, will lead the event.</p>

            <h1>US Inflation Data Meets Expectations, European Stocks Close Higher</h1>
            <p>Major European stock markets closed higher today. This happened because US inflation numbers were as expected. This made it more likely that the US central bank will cut interest rates next week. At the same time, the European Central Bank kept interest rates the same for the second meeting in a row, as people expected. They also increased their predictions for economic growth and inflation in the Eurozone this year.</p>
            <p>London's FTSE 100 index went up by 72.19 points, or 0.78%. It closed at 9297.58 points.</p>
            <p>Frankfurt's DAX index went up by 70.70 points, or 0.30%. It closed at 23703.65 points.</p>
            <p>Paris's CAC 40 index went up by 62.20 points, or 0.80%. It closed at 7823.52 points.</p>
