They said they were sorry because the post was not thoughtful and caused unhappiness. They promised to be more careful in the future.

**France and New Caledonia Reach Agreement: New Caledonia to Be a "State within the Republic"**

France announced an important agreement with New Caledonia today. This agreement means that New Caledonia, a French territory, will remain part of France. However, it will also be recognized as the "State of New Caledonia." French President Emmanuel Macron said this agreement is "a bet on trust" and called it "historic." He hopes it will start a new peaceful relationship between New Caledonia and France. Last year, there was serious violence in the area, which caused many deaths and a lot of damage. New Caledonia has about 270,000 people and has been ruled by France since the 1800s.
