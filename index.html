            <h1>Nantou: River Water Rises, Cars Asked to Move from Low Areas</h1>
            <p>Nantou County has had a lot of rain for several days. Because of this, the ground and rocks are loose in many places, and rocks are falling. A section of Road 54, at 13.4 kilometers, is damaged and might fall apart, so it is now closed. People who need to travel between Jiji and Shuili can use Provincial Highway 16 instead. The water in the Maoluo River is getting higher. People are asked to move their cars from areas that are low and might flood.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Agency said that strong winds from the southwest will bring short but heavy rain. Today, some mountain areas in Nantou County will have very strong rain, and other parts of Nantou County will have heavy rain. The forecast at 10 AM predicts that the mountains in Nantou will get 100 to 190 millimeters of rain in the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p>This morning, Nantou County leader Hsu Shu-Hua said on Facebook that the Maoluo River's water level is going up. She asked the Nantou City office to tell local leaders to use broadcasts more often. These broadcasts tell people to move their cars from under tall bridges and from low areas. Also, warning lines have been put in place, and water pumps are still running.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-Hua also said that rocks have fallen at the 28-kilometer mark on Road 89. The Shanshanxi Highway is blocked because of mud and rocks falling, so cars cannot pass. She has asked a company that has a contract for this kind of work to help clear the road.</p>
            <p>The Jiji Township Office announced that a serious crack and sinking have appeared in the road near Puji Bridge, at 13.4 kilometers on Road 54. This part of the road might fall apart at any time. So, this road is now closed. People driving from Shuili to Jiji should use Provincial Highway 16 instead. However, a part of Provincial Highway 16 at 12 kilometers had a landslide a few days ago, so only one direction of traffic can pass there now.</p>

            <h1>Expert: New Parts on Frigate Make It Fight Better and Faster</h1>
            <p>The Navy's Kang Ding ships, which are a type of warship, have been improved. They now have a new missile system called the Huayang Vertical Launch System, made by NCSIST, and new Sea Sword II missiles. An expert said today that the Sea Sword II missiles can travel much farther than the older Sea Chaparral missiles. Also, the new launch system can fire missiles very quickly, one after another, without needing to move around to aim. The ships also have a new rotating radar. This radar gives a 3D picture of the area, helping the ships see far away, aim correctly, and react fast.</p>
            <p>To make its fighting power stronger, the Navy has set aside 43.1599 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This money will be used from 2022 to 2030. It will pay for improving the fighting systems of six Kang Ding-class ships (also known as Lafayette-class ships) in the Navy's 124th group of ships. The first ship to get this upgrade, called the Chengde ship, went to sea for tests on the morning of July 28. It should finish its upgrade and be ready to fight again by the end of this year. Starting next year, one ship will be upgraded each year. This will make the Navy's fighting power complete.</p>
            <p>The upgrades for the Kang Ding ships include better missiles to stop planes, better systems to control fights, better ways to find things, and better sound equipment that can be pulled in the water. For the missile system, the ships used to have short-range anti-aircraft missiles called Sea Chaparral. Now, after the upgrade, they will carry a "Huayang" Vertical Launch System (VLS), made by NCSIST. This system will hold 32 Sea Sword II (TC-2N) missiles that can shoot down planes.</p>
            <p>The new missile system on the front of the ship has 8 parts, and each part can hold 4 Sea Sword II missiles. Su Tzu-yun, an expert from a defense research group, said that Sea Sword II missiles can fly much farther, about 30 to 40 kilometers. The old Sea Chaparral missiles could only fly about 8 kilometers. Also, there are more Sea Sword II missiles, and they fire much faster. When fighting, these new missiles can fire in just "seconds" and then fly towards the target. They can even fire many times quickly. This means they are much stronger than the old missiles.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kang Ding ships have a new radar called Type 997. This radar is made by a British company called BAE Systems. It turns around and helps the ship find things much better. Su Tzu-yun explained that the old radar on the Kang Ding ships showed a flat picture (2D). But the new radar shows a 3D picture. This means it can not only find targets and their distance but also their height. This helps the Kang Ding ships get a full picture of the battle. Also, public information shows that this new radar can "find and follow" more than 200 targets at the same time. So, the ships can see far, aim well, and react more quickly.</p>
            <p>The design for the Kang Ding ships came from the Lafayette-class ships of the French Navy. These ships are part of the Navy's 124th group of ships. Their main port is Zuoying Naval Base. Their main jobs are to protect the Taiwan Strait from attacks from the air, find and fight submarines, protect other ships, stop blockades, and join in stopping enemy ships on the water. There are 6 of these ships now: Kang Ding (PFG-1202), Xining (PFG-1203), Kunming (PFG-1205), Dihua (PFG-1206), Wuchang (PFG-1207), and Chengde (PFG-1208).</p>

            <h1>Mercedes Driver Shows ID to Force Way, Causes Public Anger in China</h1>
            <p>A man in Guangxi recently posted a video online. He said that a woman driving a Mercedes-Benz car showed him an "ID card" and told him to move his car when they met on the road. The woman also knew his private information. The man thought that a government worker might be using their power in the wrong way. Today, the government shared what they found after looking into it. They said the woman was using her husband's official ID to scare the man. News reports said that "showing off special rights" is a big problem. This small argument became a big issue all over the country.</p>
            <p>On July 22nd, a man named Li was driving in Fangchenggang City, Guangxi. He met a Mercedes-Benz car. The woman driving the Mercedes showed him an ID that said "Administrative Enforcement" and made him let her pass. The man in the car with her (who was the driver's father) even looked at Mr. Li's car license plate and then said his home address and last name.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li believed that a government worker was using their power to get his personal information. He was very angry and complained about it. But the police did not come to deal with the situation. So, he put the short video online, and it was watched over ten million times.</p>
            <p>On July 31st, police officers from the local station came to his house late at night. They told him that his videos showed the woman driver's car plate, which was against her privacy. They asked him to delete the videos and say sorry. He took down the first video. Then he put it back online, but this time he covered parts of it, and it became popular again.</p>
            <p>At first, the police said they could not share if the woman was a government worker. But after many people talked about it, they changed their minds. They then said that a group had started to look into the matter.</p>
            <p>Today, a team from the Fangchenggang City government in Guangxi shared what they found after their investigation. They said that the 28-year-old woman, Ms. Hou, who was driving the Mercedes-Benz, is not a government worker herself. Her husband is a firefighter in a town in Shangsi County, which is also in Fangchenggang City. The "official ID" that Ms. Hou showed belonged to her husband. She showed it to Mr. Li to scare him.</p>
            <p>After Ms. Hou's actions were seen online, they caused a bad effect on society. The police are now looking into it and taking action according to the law. Her husband, Mr. Li, did not take good care of his ID. This led to his ID being used in a wrong way. He is thought to have broken work rules, and the Fangchenggang City Fire Rescue team has started an official investigation against him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li was worried that his private information was shared. The report said this happened because Ms. Hou's family and Mr. Li's parents' family live close by and know each other. But Mr. Li has worked far from home for many years and did not know this. When the argument about driving happened, Ms. Hou's father, who was in the car with her, got out and recognized Mr. Li. That is why he said Mr. Li's home address and other private details at that time.</p>
            <p>The report clearly stated that Ms. Hou and her father do not have special tools like "police communication devices" or other equipment used by government legal offices to find people's information. So, they did not look up Mr. Li's private details at the place where the event happened.</p>
            <p>The Chinese news website, The Paper, said today that an official ID card held by a firefighter from a small town could be used by his wife to scare other people. This shows that some people still like to "show off their special rights," and this is happening a lot. They "use every small bit of power they have."</p>
            <p>This event also makes people ask if the police handled the situation and answered questions in a good way. The report said that today, with social media, when someone "shows off their special rights," many people online see it. This makes the issue much bigger and turns it into a national news story. This can hurt the good name of the local area a lot. This is an important lesson from this event.</p>
