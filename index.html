**Oil prices fall a little as Middle East tension lessens**

On June 30th, international oil prices fell a bit. This happened after they had their biggest weekly drop in two years. Investors are guessing how much more oil OPEC+ (oil-producing countries) will make. Also, worries about conflicts in the Middle East affecting oil supplies have gone down.

The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August delivery went down by 41 cents, to US$65.11 per barrel. The price of Brent crude oil for August delivery in London went down by 16 cents, to US$67.61 per barrel.

**Trump to talk about tariffs with trade team, set rates for some countries before July 9**

On June 30th, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Trump will meet with his trade team this week. They will decide on tariffs (taxes on goods from other countries) for countries that are "not negotiating fairly." This needs to be done before the deadline of July 9.

Leavitt also said at the White House press conference that the US is "finishing" a trade deal with India. Additionally, President Trump seemed to threaten new tariffs on Japan. He said this is because Japan does not want to buy rice from the US.

Trump wrote on his social media, "Truth Social," today: "They don't take our rice, and they have a big rice shortage themselves. We will send them a letter, and we hope to continue being trade partners with them for many years to come." Officials from both the US and Japan have been talking about trade for months. However, they have not yet solved difficult issues about tariffs and trade barriers.

Japan has been asking the US to remove a 25% tax on cars, saying it hurts a very important industry. But Trump is not sure about this request because Japan does not import many US-made cars.

When asked if Trump's post meant the trade talks between the US and Japan were over, Kevin Hassett, a White House economic advisor, said that both sides would still continue to talk. Hassett also said that the Trump administration will announce trade deals with several countries after July 4th, which is US Independence Day.
