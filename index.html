            <h1>Taiwan's Drone Industry Grows Fast, Exports Up Over 7 Times</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's drone industry is doing well by focusing on supply chains that are "not red," meaning they don't rely on parts from China. This strategy is helping them sell more drones in other countries. According to customs information, in the first six months of this year, Taiwan sold drones worth 11.89 million US dollars. This is about 350 million New Taiwan dollars. This amount is 7.49 times more than what they sold in the same period last year. Most of these drones went to Poland.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) says that because of changes in world politics, Taiwan's drone industry is becoming a new choice for buyers in Europe. This is because Taiwan has strong skills in information and communication technology, can make things flexibly, and is a democratic country.</p>
            <p>Also, the government is planning to buy about 50,000 drones in the next four years for different government groups. This will help the drone industry in Taiwan grow even more and get more sales.</p>
            <p>Latest customs information shows that from January to June this year, Taiwan's drone exports reached 11.89 million US dollars. This is a big increase of 749% compared to the same time last year. The top five countries that bought drones from Taiwan are Poland, the United States, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong. These five countries bought 97% of all the drones exported.</p>
            <p>In the first half of this year, drones sent to Poland were worth 6.48 million US dollars, which is 54% of all drone exports. This is much more than other places. Since last December, Taiwan has been sending many more drones to Europe, which shows that Taiwanese companies are starting to sell well in the European market.</p>
            <p>Exports to the United States were 1.549 million US dollars, making it the second largest buyer. This is an increase of 209% from last year. Germany was third, buying 1.458 million US dollars worth of drones, which is 258 times more than last year. Also, in past years, Taiwan did not send any drones to the Czech Republic. But recently, customs data shows that the Czech Republic is now the fourth largest buyer of Taiwan's drones in the first half of this year. Hong Kong is in fifth place.</p>
            <p>TAITRA stated that because global supply chains are changing and there are political issues, Europe cares more about military safety, cybersecurity, and important technology. Since the war between Ukraine and Russia and the growing problems in the Middle East, the European Union has been trying to reduce its reliance on Chinese products and work with democratic countries. Taiwan's drone industry is now a new and important option for European buyers because of its strong IT skills, flexible production, and democratic background.</p>
            <p>Europe needs more drones. TAITRA says that drones are needed for military uses like border security, watching over land, and defending against other drones. They are also used for daily life, like spraying crops in farming, checking buildings, and watching cities. European companies and governments are actively looking for reliable partners. This is a very good time for Taiwanese companies to enter the European market.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry of National Defense recently said it will start a big project to buy military drones made for commercial use. To make the local drone market bigger, the government has already looked at what drones different government departments will need in the next four years. These needs come from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Economic Affairs. They need about 50,000 drones in total. After the Executive Yuan approves the plan, these departments will set aside money to buy them.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Excellent Drone Overseas Business Alliance" started in September last year. It has been going to countries like Europe and Japan to sell drones. People in the industry say that the export numbers from the first half of this year show how strong the drone "national team" is when they work together overseas. Even though China still sells commercial drones at lower prices, Taiwanese companies can actively enter drone markets in Europe and America because of the trend towards non-red supply chains and cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Industry experts say that members of Taiwan's drone alliance include companies that make whole drones, parts for drones, batteries, and ground equipment. This means they can make things from start to finish and respond quickly to orders and delivery needs. Also, Taiwanese companies are very good at making important parts like semiconductors, chips, communication parts, and modules. This helps them support many different uses and new designs.</p>

            <h1>Clinic Sign Falls in Taichung, Damages 6 Motorcycles, No One Hurt</h1>
            <p>In Taichung City's Taiping District, a sign from a Chinese medicine clinic fell down on July 26. It is not clear why it fell. The falling sign damaged six motorcycles parked below. Luckily, no one was walking by at the time, so no one was hurt or killed. The clinic has already contacted the motorcycle owners to discuss how to pay for the damage.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiping Police Department in Taichung City released a statement. It said that at 1:47 PM on July 26, the sign of a Chinese medicine clinic on Zhongxing Road in Taiping District fell for an unknown reason. It hit six motorcycles below, causing different amounts of damage to them. No one was passing by, so no one was injured.</p>
            <p>Police think that the sign fell because it was old and its screws became loose. The clinic is now working with the motorcycle owners to handle the payments for the damaged bikes.</p>
