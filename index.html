            <h1>UMC Reportedly Asks Suppliers to Lower Prices by Over 15% Next Year; Material Factories Likely Hit First</h1>
            <p>UMC, a company that makes computer chips for other companies, has reportedly asked its suppliers to cut prices by more than 15% starting next year. UMC did not comment on this news. Experts think that companies making silicon wafers, masks, special gases, and grinding materials will be affected the most.</p>
            <p>It is said in the semiconductor industry that UMC recently sent a notice to its suppliers. UMC asked them to lower their prices by over 15% next year. They also asked for a plan within one month. This is to make costs better, keep their place in the market, and help suppliers in the long run.</p>
            <p>UMC did not comment on the news about asking suppliers to lower prices. The company said that the industry's situation in the third quarter was as they expected and did not get worse. They did not say anything about next year's situation yet. UMC had previously said that chip deliveries in the third quarter might go up by 1% to 3%, and the average price of their products in US dollars would stay the same.</p>
            <p>Experts think that big international equipment makers have not yet received UMC's price-cut notice. The main companies that will be affected are those that supply silicon wafers, masks, special gases, chemicals, and grinding materials. However, they still have one to two months to prepare. We need to see how UMC's suppliers will change to deal with this.</p>
            <p>Investors are worried that the semiconductor industry might change next year, which could put pressure on UMC's operations. UMC's stock price opened higher today but then went down. During the day, it changed from positive to negative. It reached 43.35 NT dollars at one point, falling by 0.9 NT dollars, which is more than 2%.</p>

            <h1>Marine National Park HQ Cleans Beaches on Southern Four Islands, Making Coasts Clean Again</h1>
            <p>The Marine National Park Headquarters (MNPHQ) of the Ministry of the Interior's National Park Agency held a three-day autumn beach cleaning event. On Penghu's Southern Four Islands, they removed 305 kilograms of trash that floated in from the sea. Special trained volunteers used ropes to bring the trash down steep cliffs. This made the coasts clean again.</p>
            <p>The MNPHQ released a statement saying that its "Salute to the Sea â€“ Special Autumn Post-Typhoon Beach Cleaning Action" took place from September 29th to October 1st. Around 70 people joined the event on Dongjiyu Island. These people included members from the Taiwan Promise Charity Association, students from Tainan City's Jiangjun Elementary School, the Southern Four Islands Team of the 7th Peace Preservation Corps, Dongjiyu Inspection Station, local volunteers, and MNPHQ staff.</p>
            <p>The MNPHQ said that Typhoon Huaqia Sha brought strong winds and heavy rain to Penghu's Southern Four Islands. A lot of trash from the sea piled up on the island's coasts and rock edges. Many people worked together to clean the beaches after the typhoon. They collected old fishing nets, buoys, styrofoam, plastic bags, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, glass bottles, and other trash. The total amount was 305 kilograms. Most of it was plastic bottles, and 54% of these came from China.</p>
            <p>The MNPHQ also said that some of the trash on Dongjiyu Island was stuck in the basalt cliffs. These cliffs are very steep, so it was hard for people to reach the trash in the usual way. Luckily, trained special volunteers worked in the hot weather. They used ropes to climb down and remove the trash from the cliffs. This made the beautiful cliffs and sea views clean again, just like before.</p>
