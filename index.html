            <h1>Pharmaceutical Stocks Lead European Markets to Close Higher</h1>
            <p>On October 1st, European stock markets closed higher. This happened even though the US government stopped working because politicians could not agree on a spending plan. Pharmaceutical companies helped the markets grow. This was after the drug company Pfizer agreed to lower medicine prices in the United States and was allowed to avoid some taxes by Trump.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 96.00 points, or 1.03%, ending the day at 9446.43 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up by 232.90 points, or 0.98%, ending at 24113.62 points.</p>

            <h1>Scaffolding Collapse at Ethiopia Church Kills 36, Injures Over 200</h1>
            <p>State media in Ethiopia, a country in East Africa, reported that a temporary scaffolding platform fell down at a church today. This accident caused at least 36 deaths and more than 200 injuries.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that the accident happened around 7:45 AM local time. It was in Arerti town, about 70 kilometers east of the capital city, Addis Ababa. Many people were there for an annual festival to celebrate the Virgin Mary.</p>
            <p>Ahmed Gebeyehu, the local police chief, spoke to the state-run Fana Broadcasting Corporation. He said, "The number of dead people has reached 36, and it might go higher." He also said that over 200 injured people were taken to a local hospital for help.</p>
            <p>Another local official, Atnafu Abate, told another state media, Ethiopia Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), that some people are still trapped under the fallen scaffolding. Some people with more serious injuries have been sent to hospitals in the capital. He did not give more details about those trapped or any possible rescue plans.</p>
            <p>Pictures posted by the Ethiopia Broadcasting Corporation on its Facebook page showed wooden poles lying everywhere after the collapse. Crowds of people gathered among the many broken pieces. Other pictures of the church from outside also showed that the scaffolding was built in a way that was not safe.</p>

            <h1>Corner of 20-Story New York Building Collapses After Gas Explosion; No Injuries Reported Yet</h1>
            <p>Today in the Bronx area of New York City, USA, a 20-story building had a gas explosion. This caused a whole corner of the building to fall down. Emergency workers are now at the place of the accident. The New York City Fire Department said they have not heard about any injuries or deaths yet.</p>
            <p>CBS News reported that the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) stated the explosion happened around 8:10 AM local time. It was at the Mitchel Houses, a large apartment complex in the Bronx.</p>
            <p>The explosion made many bricks and other broken parts of the building fall onto nearby buildings and the sidewalk. Water seemed to be shooting out from the ground, which might mean water pipes were broken. Firefighters are looking through the debris. They are also using drones and special dogs to check if anyone is trapped.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Fire Department got a call about a gas explosion that caused the incinerator shaft of the 20-story building to fall apart. Officials said that no homes inside the complex were affected. This building is public housing owned by the city government.</p>
            <p>Pictures from the scene show that one corner of the tall building, from the ground to the roof, completely fell down. Videos taken by people living nearby show a large cloud of dust covering the street right after the collapse, which happened around 8:10 AM.</p>
            <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams said he has been told about the situation. Officials are still checking what happened. On the social media site X, he asked people: "For your safety, please stay away from the area where this happened."</p>
            <p>The report explained that incinerator shafts in New York City buildings used to burn trash inside the building. Now, they can still use the old openings, but mostly, trash compactors are used instead.</p>
