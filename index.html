            <h1>12-Meter-Tall Capybara to Join Bitan Art Show in New Taipei</h1>
            <p>The New Taipei City Tourism and Travel Department said today that the Bitan Landscape Art Exhibition this year will have a very popular Japanese cartoon character, a 12-meter-tall Capybara, as its main attraction. The exhibition will be open from October 24th to December 21st. Everyone is welcome to enjoy this lovely and comforting event.</p>
            <p>A press release from the Tourism and Travel Department stated that this year's Bitan Landscape Art Exhibition will start on the evening of October 24th. The main display will be a Capybara-themed art installation. Also, a beautiful fireworks show will happen on the same night, which is another big highlight. There will be a scene where the zookeeper and Capybara look up at the night sky to watch the fireworks together at Bitan, creating a lovely and romantic feeling.</p>
            <p>The Tourism and Travel Department mentioned that the 12-meter-tall Capybara will be floating on the water, appearing in Taiwan for the first time. On land, its good friend "Alpaca-kun" will be the main spot for photos. This creates two special attractions, one on water and one on land, giving visitors a varied experience.</p>
            <p>Also, Capybara's friends, "Capybara-chan," "Miss White," "Passionate-kun," "Wild-kun," and "Sunny-kun," will all gather at the east bank plaza of Bitan. This will create a warm and cute atmosphere. Below the Bitan suspension bridge, there will be a fun photo wall to welcome visitors.

            <h1>Israeli News: Hamas Gives 20 Israeli Hostages to Red Cross</h1>
            <p>Israeli news said that Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, has given 20 Israeli hostages who are still alive to the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip today. This happened in different groups. On the same day, former US President Trump arrived in Israel, and people cheered loudly for him.</p>
            <p>The first group of seven hostages had already returned to Israel. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported, quoting Israel's public broadcaster, that the second group of 13 hostages was handed over in Khan Yunis, which is in the southern part of the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>The war in Gaza has lasted for two years. Many thousands of Palestinians have died, and several Israeli hostages were held by Palestinian armed groups. With help from the United States, Israel and Hamas finally agreed to stop fighting and release the hostages.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Trump on the airport runway today with music from a military band.</p>
            <p>In Tel Aviv, at Hostages Square, where many protests happened during the Gaza war, people cheered loudly for Trump. Before his plane, Air Force One, landed, it flew over Hostages Square, where tens of thousands of people had gathered.</p>
            <p>Trump then went to the Israeli Parliament (Knesset). He was ready to tell Israeli lawmakers about his plan for peace in the Middle East.</p>
            <p>The seven hostages who were set free earlier are expected to meet their families and have health checks.</p>
            <p>According to the agreement, Israel will also let go of more than 1900 Palestinian prisoners.</p>

            <h1>Chang Chia-chi's Tea Brand Among World's Top 20, Bringing New Tastes to Taiwan Tea</h1>
            <p>Chang Chia-chi, a young tea maker from Miaoli, has made his own brand known around the world. He has won the top awards in the three most important tea competitions in the world. This year, TasteAtlas, a global food guide, named his brand one of the top 20 best tea brands in the world for 2025. It is the only brand from Taiwan on the list.</p>
            <p>Today, Miaoli County Governor Chung Tung-chin met and honored Chang Chia-chi at the county government office. He praised Chang for his excellent tea-making skills and new ideas, which have put Taiwanese tea on the world stage again. Chung Tung-chin also tried Chang Chia-chi's special champagne-sparkling tea. He said it was smooth and had many layers of flavor, saying, "You know it's a high-quality product as soon as you taste it," and "It makes you want to drink it slowly."</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-chi comes from a family that makes tea equipment. He uses a careful and experimental way to check every step of making tea. He writes down details about the tea leaves and how he controls the temperature and humidity during the drying process. This has helped Taiwanese black tea and Oriental Beauty tea have new and complex flavors.</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-chi, who is 40 years old, has won many awards in international competitions with his brand, FormoCha. So far, he has won all the top awards in major tea competitions, including the Great Taste Awards three-star award in the UK, the highest Gold Award at the World Green Tea Contest in Japan, and the AVPA International Tea Competition in France. Eva Air also chose his tea for their business class. This year, TasteAtlas, a global food guide, named his brand one of the top 20 best tea brands in the world for 2025, making it the only Taiwanese brand on the list.</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-chi pointed out that TasteAtlas has over one million followers worldwide. Their way of choosing is based on how brands perform in important global tea competitions, reviews from experts, and feedback from many customers. Only two Japanese brands made the list. When he found out his brand was chosen, he first thought it was a scam. He said, "I was really surprised and happy."</p>
            <p>About his unique champagne tea, Chang Chia-chi explained that it is different from champagne (the alcoholic drink) which is made from grapes or other fruits. Tea does not ferment, but he uses many steps of oxidation to create different smells and tastes. He then adds bubbles under pressure. After being in a pressure tank for some time, it is bottled. When chilled, it tastes as good as champagne. It can be served with fancy meals, just like champagne, but it has no alcohol.</p>
            <p>Chung Tung-chin said that the county government helps young farmers innovate and change. Chang Chia-chi uses new ideas to show traditional tea-making. This helps the world see the depth and different sides of Taiwanese tea, making the quality and value of tea products much better. He is a source of pride for Miaoli and for Taiwan.</p>
