            <h1>Trump Adds 25% Tariff on Indian Goods, Totaling 50%, Starting August 27</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump signed a special order today. He said that because India buys Russian oil, either directly or indirectly, the US will add another 25% tax (tariff) on Indian products. With the earlier 25% tax already announced, Indian products sent to the US will now face a very high 50% tax. This new tax will begin on August 27.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said: "We put a 25% tax on India, but I think I will raise it a lot in the next 24 hours because they are buying Russian oil."</p>
            <p>Today, Trump signed the order. It says that because India buys Russian oil, the US will add a 25% tax on Indian products. This tax is in addition to the 25% tax that was going to start on August 7. So, the total tax on Indian products will be 50%.</p>
            <p>The White House released a document stating that the extra 25% tax on India will start on August 27.</p>
            <p>Earlier news reports said that India's foreign ministry stated on August 4 that the US and EU were "targeting" India because it buys Russian oil. India said these actions were "unfair" and that India would protect its own interests.</p>
            <p>India is a big buyer of Russian oil. Oil is the main way Russia gets money for its military actions in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued for more than three years with no sign of stopping. Trump had previously warned that he would put "secondary tariffs" on countries, like China and India, that continue to trade with Russia.</p>

            <h1>Hezbollah Refuses to Disarm After Lebanese Cabinet Decision</h1>
            <p>The government of Lebanon met yesterday and decided to ask the military to create a plan. This plan is to disarm Hezbollah, a strong group in Lebanon that gets support from Iran, by the end of the year. Today, Hezbollah said they will not follow this decision. They also said the government's decision makes Lebanon weaker.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that this difficult decision was made after nearly six hours of meetings, led by President Joseph Aoun. The US had put a lot of pressure on Lebanon to make this decision.</p>
            <p>This decision will also help to fulfill the ceasefire agreement that Lebanon and Israel made last November. That agreement was supposed to stop more than a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. This included two months of full-scale war. After the war, Hezbollah became much weaker, their weapons were badly damaged, and many of their important leaders were killed.</p>
            <p>Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam announced at a press conference yesterday after the meeting that the government has asked the military to present a plan by the end of the month. This plan will be discussed and approved by the cabinet. The goal is that by the end of the year, only the national army and other state forces will be allowed to have weapons.</p>
            <p>However, Lebanon's Information Minister Paul Morcos said that two ministers left the meeting because they did not agree with the cabinet's decision. These ministers were Health Minister Rakan Nassereldine, who is linked to Hezbollah, and Environment Minister Tamara Elzein, who is linked to Hezbollah's ally, the Amal Movement.</p>
            <p>Hezbollah is the only group that still has weapons in Lebanon after the civil war from 1975 to 1990. They say they need weapons to fight Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p>
            <p>During yesterday's cabinet meeting, Hezbollah's leader, Naim Qassem, said in a television speech that they would not disarm as long as Israel's attacks continue.</p>
            <p>Today, Hezbollah released another statement. They said they will "consider the cabinet's decision as if it does not exist." They also said, "The Salam government's decision to disarm Lebanon against its enemy Israel is a serious mistake. This harms Lebanon's power and allows Israel to do whatever it wants regarding safety, land, politics, and its future existence."</p>
            <p>Hezbollah has been the most powerful political group in Lebanon for a long time. People who disagree with them say that Hezbollah uses its weapons to force its own ideas on national issues. But after recent fights with Israel, Hezbollah's power has decreased.</p>
