            <h1>Berlin Police Arrest 3 Hamas Suspects, Find Weapons, Suspect Terrorist Attack Plan</h1>
            <p>On October 1st, the German Federal Public Prosecutor's Office ordered the arrest of three people who are believed to be members of Hamas. Prosecutors said the suspects had been collecting guns and bullets for Hamas since this summer. They planned to attack Jewish and Israeli places in Germany. Police found an AK-47 assault rifle, several pistols, and hundreds of bullets during the operation.</p>
            <p>The German Federal Public Prosecutor's Office said the three arrested people are Abed Al G. (36 years old), Wael F. M. (43 years old), and Ahmad I. (44 years old). Two of them are German citizens, and one was born in Lebanon. The Berlin newspaper reported that the two German suspects have Syrian and Lebanese family backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors stated that the three suspects are believed to have joined a foreign terrorist group. They worked as "overseas agents" for Hamas. They had direct contact with the military leaders of the group. They were planning violent actions that would be dangerous for Germany's national security.</p>
            <p>Investigators watched the suspects for a long time. On October 1st, they learned that the suspects were exchanging weapons in the Moabit area of Berlin. The Berlin police quickly raided the location. They arrested the three people there and found an AK-47 assault rifle, several Glock pistols, and a lot of ammunition.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors said that these weapons were meant for Hamas to carry out deadly attacks on Israeli or Jewish places in Germany. The suspects got the guns and bullets from the black market. They wanted to carry out attacks inside Germany.</p>
            <p>This event caused a lot of worry in Germany. Stefanie Hubig, the Federal Minister of Justice, called it a "very serious event." She said that the country has a duty to protect Jewish life and will not allow any anti-Semitism.</p>
            <p>Alexander Throm, a politician from the CDU party, asked for strict actions. These actions include taking away German citizenship from people involved in terrorism. After they finish their prison time, they should be sent out of the country, especially if they have two citizenships. He believes that people who plan terrorist attacks should not be allowed to stay in Germany.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Jendro, a spokesperson for the Berlin police union, said that the weapons found show a worrying threat. He asked the government to quickly give new technology to security departments. He also asked for clearer laws to fight terrorist attacks more effectively.</p>
            <p>The three suspects will be taken to Karlsruhe on October 2nd. A judge from the Federal Supreme Court will decide if they should be kept in prison.</p>
            <p>In December 2023, German prosecutors arrested four Lebanese men in Berlin. These men were following orders from Hamas. They were looking for weapons hidden in Europe. Prosecutors said they were planning to attack Jewish places. At that time, this case changed how German security services saw Hamas. They used to think Germany was only a place for Hamas to hide supplies. But now, they believe Germany has become a target for Hamas's terrorist attacks.</p>

            <h1>Czech Republic Stops Unapproved Russian Diplomats and Official Passports from Entering to Prevent Spies</h1>
            <p>On October 1st, Czech Foreign Minister Jan LipavskÃ½ announced that the Czech government has stopped Russian diplomats and people with official passports from entering the Czech Republic if they are not approved by the Czech state. This is because Russian spies often use diplomatic status to hide their true work. He also said that "Schengen should help Europeans, not be used against Europe."</p>
            <p>On September 30th, Jan LipavskÃ½ wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that his idea led the government to stop Russian diplomats and people with official passports from entering the Czech Republic if they are not approved by the Czech state. This rule applies to international airports in the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>LipavskÃ½ said, "Harmful actions are increasing. We will not risk letting agents work here while pretending to be diplomats. We are setting an example for other countries. I will continue to ask for the strictest rules at the Schengen level. We will protect the Czech Republic."</p>
            <p>Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, called this ban a "crazy measure." The Russian Foreign Ministry is looking into the matter and will give a more detailed answer later.</p>
            <p>According to LipavskÃ½, this ban will be put into practice at the external borders of the Schengen area in the Czech Republic. This mainly includes the six international airports in the country. This rule does not apply to diplomats who are approved and work in the Czech Republic. It also does not apply to people who only travel through the Czech Republic to their country of work or to attend meetings of international organizations.</p>
            <p>Last week, the EU's foreign affairs department suggested new rules as part of new sanctions against Russia. These rules say that Russian diplomats working in the EU must report all their entries and exits within the area. This idea is similar to LipavskÃ½'s argument from the last two years: "limit the free movement of Russian diplomats in the Schengen area." But this idea has not yet received enough support.</p>
            <p>LipavskÃ½ told the Czech News Agency (ÄŒTK) that he is trying to explain to the EU that diplomatic relationships need to be based on the idea of "give and take."</p>
            <p>LipavskÃ½ stressed that Russian spies often use their diplomatic status to hide their work. He said, "So, I believe there is no reason for us to make it easy for them to travel in Europe. Schengen should help Europeans, not be used against Europe."</p>
            <p>The Czech visa center in Russia stopped taking all applications on September 29th. Now, people must apply for visas through the consular department of the Czech Embassy in Moscow. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Czech Republic has stopped giving tourist visas to Russian citizens.</p>
            <p>Two weeks ago, the Czech government also approved a rule. It says that Georgian diplomats and people with official passports need to apply for a visa for short trips to the Czech Republic. This was done because the Georgian government is taking strong actions against its own people's groups.</p>

            <h1>US Crude Oil Stock Increases, International Oil Prices Drop</h1>
            <p>New York, October 1st â€“ International oil prices went down today. This happened because investors were thinking about two things. First, OPEC+ (a group of oil-producing countries) might increase oil production faster. Second, the amount of crude oil stored in the United States has gone up.</p>
            <p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November went down by 1%. It closed at $61.78 per barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price for Brent crude oil for December also dropped by 1%. It finished at $65.35 per barrel.</p>
