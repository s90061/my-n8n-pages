            <h1>Experts Think Taiwan Will Reach Agreement with US Before August 7 Due to New Trump Tariffs</h1>
            <p>US President Trump announced new tariffs on July 31st, which will start on August 7th. These new tariffs include a 20% tax on goods from Taiwan. But talks between Taiwan and the US are still happening. Some experts from other countries believe that economies like Taiwan or India might reach an agreement within the 7-day grace period.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Trump often sets trade deadlines and then cancels or extends them. This has led to people saying, "Trump always backs down." However, analysts think he will not change his mind this time.</p>
            <p>Matthew Aks, an expert on public policy at Evercore ISI, said that he does not expect "big changes" to the new order. But he thinks that some economies, like Taiwan or India, might finalize an agreement within the 7-day period.</p>
            <p>Josh Lipsky, an international economics expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington, also believes that Trump "did not back down." He is "keeping his promises and even doing more" about tariffs, which he made during his election campaign.</p>
            <p>Before announcing these new tariffs, Trump had difficult talks and made many agreements. The most important ones were with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. Trump set different tariff rates and said that the US would get a lot of investment.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te posted on Facebook. He said that the US's new tariff policy, which taxes goods equally, has achieved some success. The US government told them that the tariff rate has gone down from 32% to 20%. But the final meeting has not happened yet, so the final tax rate is not decided. This is why the 20% tariff is "temporary."</p>
            <p>Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun and her team recently had another round of talks in Washington about the new US tariffs. She returned to Taiwan this morning and said, "The talks will continue. We will keep working hard to get a better tax rate."</p>

            <h1>Financial Holdings' Overseas Risk Drops to NT$27 Trillion, Biggest Decrease in One Quarter</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) shared some numbers. By the end of the second quarter, the total risk of financial holding groups overseas was 27.02 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. This amount went down by 2.09 trillion New Taiwan Dollars in just one quarter. This is because the New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger in the second quarter. This is a 7.2% decrease compared to the previous quarter. It is the biggest drop recorded since they started tracking this in 2015. Out of this, the risk in the United States was 9.56 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. The US is still the country where financial holdings have the most risk. But its share of the total overseas risk went down to 35.39%.</p>
            <p>Since the second quarter of 2015, the FSC has been sharing quarterly reports about the risks of financial holding groups both in Taiwan and overseas. These risks include money lent between banks, loans, and total investments.</p>
            <p>In the first quarter of this year, the total overseas risk of financial holding groups reached its highest point ever, at 29.12 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. However, when overseas risks measured in US dollars are changed to New Taiwan Dollars, the strong increase of the New Taiwan Dollar by 10.97% in the second quarter also affected the overseas risk numbers.</p>
            <p>The FSC's data shows that by the end of the second quarter, financial holding groups' overseas risk fell to 27.02 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. This is a large drop of 2.09 trillion New Taiwan Dollars in one quarter. However, the total risk of financial holdings in Taiwan continued to grow to 47.56 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, an increase of 1.12 trillion New Taiwan Dollars from the previous quarter. The total risk, both in Taiwan and overseas, was 74.59 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, a decrease of 974.50 billion New Taiwan Dollars from the previous quarter.</p>
            <p>Looking at the top 10 countries or areas where financial holdings have overseas risk, they are the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. Compared to the first quarter, only Japan saw an increase in risk. The risk in all other countries decreased compared to the previous quarter.</p>
            <p>The United States has the highest risk at 9.56 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. However, the risk of financial holdings in the US fell below 10 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. It dropped by 792.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars in one quarter, which is the biggest single-quarter drop for US risk. The US's share of the total overseas risk also slightly decreased from 35.56% to 35.39%. Compared to the first quarter of this year, both loans and investments went down. But changes in currency exchange rates also played a part.</p>
            <p>Next, China is still the second biggest country for financial holdings' overseas risk. By the end of the second quarter, the total risk of financial holdings in China was 1.896 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. This is the lowest it has been since they started keeping records, falling below 2 trillion New Taiwan Dollars for the first time. It went down by 149.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars from the previous quarter. Looking at why this changed, net investments, net loans, and interbank lending all went down.</p>
            <p>Among the top 10 overseas risk areas, financial holdings' risk in Japan was 1.128 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, an increase of 12.31 billion New Taiwan Dollars from the previous quarter. This was mainly due to an increase in net investments. Because of this, Japan moved up to the 6th position, passing South Korea. The risk of financial holdings in South Korea was 1.073 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, placing it 7th. It decreased by 52.54 billion New Taiwan Dollars from the previous quarter.</p>

            <h1>"Huang Yi & KUKA" Human-Robot Dance Amazes Audience at Osaka Debut of We TAIWAN</h1>
            <p>During the Osaka Expo, "We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka Â· Kansai Expo" is showing many performances that highlight Taiwan's soft power in culture. These shows are held at the Osaka Central Public Hall, a building that is 100 years old. The dance performance "Huang Yi & KUKA," which features a human and a robot, had its first show this afternoon. The delicate and warm performance greatly impressed the Japanese audience.</p>
            <p>The dancer and choreographer Huang Yi has been performing with an industrial robot arm called "KUKA" since 2012. They have performed in 47 cities so far. Since 2017, they have also created audio descriptions especially for people who cannot see well. This is the first time "Huang Yi & KUKA" is performing in Japan. They invited Japanese voice actors to record a Japanese version. This is also the second time the team has made art more accessible by using local languages, after an English version was presented at Lincoln Center in the US last year.</p>
            <p>After the show, during a talk, Huang Yi explained that adding audio descriptions helps more people enjoy art. He believes that if art can reach more people, and if visually impaired friends can also experience art through audio descriptions, then art that seems "useless" can truly help people's lives.</p>
            <p>Performing in Japan this time felt like "a dream come true" for Huang Yi. This is because his idea for dancing with a robot actually came from the popular Japanese comic "Doraemon." He even showed a drawing of "Doraemon" that he made as a child, which his father has kept safely.</p>
            <p>He said that when he was young, life was a bit hard. But the stories of "Doraemon" made him believe that "technology can change fate." Also, the idea that "Doraemon" uses tools to help everyone influenced how he created his performances with robots. He laughed and said he really needs to thank Fujiko F. Fujio for creating "Doraemon."</p>
            <p>Huang Yi also shared his thoughts about KUKA. He said that working with KUKA for more than ten years feels a bit like "transferring a small part of my soul into KUKA." However, as a dancer, his body changes with age. But "KUKA's timeline seems to stay at the moment we first started working together."</p>
            <p>One audience member was curious about KUKA's feelings. Huang Yi described KUKA as a child who never grows up, always looking at the world with a child's eyes. He said that he sees the dancers he works with getting older. He added, "Actually, I also really want to know what KUKA is thinking."</p>
            <p>"Huang Yi & KUKA" will have 3 performances today and tomorrow. Almost all of the 600 seats for each show were booked. Hundreds of people waited in a long line an hour before the show started.</p>
            <p>Miyuki Torii, a 54-year-old audience member from Osaka, told CNA that she saw a promotion for this "human-robot dance" performance at the "Taiwan Spectrum" exhibition area (at GRAND GREEN OSAKA). She was very curious, so she signed up to attend.</p>
            <p>She said she had never heard of the dancer Huang Yi before. She thought "human-robot dance" meant dancing with a robot that looks like a human. But when she watched the show, she found out it was a dance with a robot arm. Yet, it showed human feelings and love so well that she was deeply moved. She understood that "love can truly be shown through dance." She said that because the show was so amazing, she really wants to attend other We TAIWAN events.</p>
            <p>Besides "Huang Yi & KUKA," We TAIWAN will also present other events at the Osaka Central Public Hall. These include "Let Go of Your Mind," a new immersive work by the theatre group "The Gaze"; "Remaining Future VR360 Screening," which features 10 works from 4 main sections; "The Brilliant Past and Present of Taiwanese Cinema," showing 10 selected Taiwanese films; and "Magical Taiwan â€“ Taiwan Literature Exhibition," which is related to Japan's Obon festival.</p>
