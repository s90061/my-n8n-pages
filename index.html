            <h1>Trump: US-Mexico Talks Extended by 90 Days, 25% Tariff Stays</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump announced today that after talking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, there will be 90 days of discussions between the US and Mexico. The current 25% tariff on goods will not change during this time.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that his call with Sheinbaum was "very successful. We are understanding each other more and more."</p>
            <p>Trump said that goods from Mexico entering the US will continue to face a 25% tariff. This is a tax Trump put on Mexico, saying it was linked to the trading of the drug fentanyl.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that cars will have a 25% tariff, and copper, aluminum, and steel will have a 50% tariff.</p>
            <p>After Trump's announcement, Sheinbaum said today that Mexico will try to make a long-term agreement with the US to avoid tariffs.</p>
            <p>She said, "We avoided an increase in tariffs... and we got 90 days to reach a long-term agreement through talks."</p>

            <h1>Police Arrest Man in Hsinchuang Boxed Body Case After Weeks of Searching</h1>
            <p>Police in New Taipei City's Xinzhuang District announced late at night that they have found a man who is a main suspect in the boxed body murder case. After working day and night to check surveillance cameras for 22 days, they finally found video showing someone leaving the body. They then found the man, Mr. Chen, and brought him in for questioning. Police are now trying to understand why he might have been involved.</p>
            <p>The Xinzhuang Police Precinct said around 11:30 PM that on July 28, they received a report about a red suitcase found in a ditch at the end of Lane 381, Xintai Road, Xinzhuang District. Inside, they found the body of a man who had been dead for many days. After an examination, a forensic doctor believed the man was about 60 years old and had been dead for more than 10 days. There were no clear external injuries on his body.</p>
            <p>The Xinzhuang Precinct stated that they asked the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. They formed a special team that went door-to-door, interviewing nearly one hundred people in the area. They also used an "Eagle Eye Team" that worked tirelessly day and night to check many surveillance camera videos.</p>
            <p>The special team said they used 30 police officers to search criminal records based on the dead person's features, trying to find out who he was. During this time, they could not identify the dead person, and because the body had been in the ditch for a long time, the investigation became very difficult.</p>
            <p>Police said that fortunately, their interviews helped them narrow down the search. The "Eagle Eye Team" worked all night to look back at 22 days of surveillance footage, and finally, they found a breakthrough in the case. Police identified Mr. Chen as a main suspect. He was seen near the crime scene around July 6. He is suspected of leaving the body and then running away.</p>
            <p>Police found the suspect, Mr. Chen, late at night at a house on Zhongping Road in Xinzhuang District and arrested him. They will now find out his connection to the dead person, why he committed the crime, who the dead person is, and how the person died.</p>
