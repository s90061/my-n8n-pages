            <h1>Taichung City Takes Full Control of Over 260,000 Streetlights to Speed Up Repairs</h1>
            <p>Starting this year, Taichung City's streetlights will all be managed by the city's Public Works Bureau. This is true no matter who installed them. There are about 268,000 streetlights currently listed. The city will slowly add a system to find their exact location.</p>
            <p>Now, if people see a problem, they just need to give the streetlight's number. This will make repairs much faster.</p>
            <p>Shi Zhichang, a city council member, held a meeting today about how streetlights are kept in the Daan area. He said that last year, he pointed out that Taichung City's streetlights had a problem. Different groups managed them in different ways, which made repairs slow and not always good.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shi said that in the past, many streetlights in the old Taichung County area were put up by local town offices. They did not have full information, so some streetlights were not properly managed. After 2014, the city started listing them better. But still, there was not enough information, making it hard to find their locations. If a typhoon or other natural disaster broke them, they could not be fixed quickly. Only village chiefs could help look for them, which was not very efficient.</p>
            <p>Chen Binghuang, the head of Nanjuang Village in Daan area, said that some streetlights have been fixed much faster this year. However, there are still a few cases where people reported problems many times, but nothing happened. He hopes the city government will truly make repairs quicker.</p>
            <p>Hong Zhiwen, a section chief from the Public Works Bureau, explained that from this year, the bureau will take care of all streetlights in Taichung City. This includes streetlights set up by city groups or those that get electricity from Taipower. There are about 268,000 streetlights listed. They will all get new numbered tags and a special phone number to call. They will also slowly get GPS location systems. In the future, people will only need to give the number to get repairs done quickly.</p>

            <h1>All Blessings Bio-tech Shows Progress on 4 New Drugs, Using Research and Company Mergers to Grow</h1>
            <p>Lin Qun, the chairman of All Blessings Bio-tech, announced that the company is quickly moving forward with its research and development. He said that two new medicines, one for dry eyes and one for a nerve problem in the eye called neurotrophic keratitis, have made big steps recently. Also, international drug companies are talking about working with them to use these medicines.</p>
            <p>All Blessings Bio-tech is changing its plan. Instead of just developing drugs by itself, it will now use two ways to grow faster: working with others to develop drugs and also buying or merging with other companies.</p>
            <p>Today, All Blessings Bio-tech had a meeting for investors. Mr. Lin led the meeting and talked about the latest research results and the company's long-term plans. The company's eye medicines include new drugs for dry eyes, neurotrophic keratitis, glaucoma, and a new type of medicine that stops blood vessel growth. All of these have shown progress recently.</p>
            <p>The main product for All Blessings is the new medicine for dry eyes. They have made the medicine better. Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare has recently approved the second phase of human trials to find the right dose in Taiwan. They plan to start finding people for these trials in the last three months of the year. The company also plans to ask the US FDA for approval to start the third phase of trials.</p>
            <p>For the new medicine for neurotrophic keratitis, trials in the US and Brazil have shown good results in their second phase.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin said that talks are happening with international drug companies about licensing agreements for both the dry eye medicine and the neurotrophic keratitis medicine.</p>
            <p>Also, the new glaucoma medicine has been approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare to start its first and second phase human trials. They will begin looking for patients soon. The new medicine that stops blood vessel growth in the eye, which is a new type of drug, has also been made better. The company plans to talk with the US FDA about it. They hope it will be the first new medicine of its kind in the world.</p>
            <p>In other news, All Blessings Bio-tech announced today that it will work with Argus Bio-tech on research. They signed an agreement to work together on eye problems that use regenerative medicine and also on a joint problem that causes joints to wear out. Mr. Lin said they will first try to combine treatments with their current medicines to see what is possible.</p>
            <p>The company also announced on September 1st that it will invest in Cambios Bio-informatics. This is to help the company develop new precision medicines and to follow new rules from the FDA for reviewing new drugs. This investment will help All Blessings study genes and use AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create new drug models faster.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin hopes that Cambios's strengths in AI gene diagnosis software and its data from patient cases in Asia, along with its current hospitals and research networks, will help All Blessings move faster in developing precision medicine and new drugs.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Police Officer and Friend Charged for Illegally Checking Personal Information</h1>
            <p>A male police officer named Chen from the Fengyuan Police Station in Taichung City is accused of using his job to help his friend, Ms. Wang. He allegedly looked up someone's past criminal record and other private information. He also shared personal details of people who were victims of scams with Ms. Wang.</p>
            <p>After an investigation, prosecutors have charged both Mr. Chen and Ms. Wang. They are accused of breaking laws about protecting personal information.</p>
            <p>The official document from the Taichung District Prosecutors Office says that Mr. Chen worked as a police officer at the Dingjie Police Station in Fengyuan from September 2020 to February 2025. He met Ms. Wang because they both invested in virtual money. They became friends on the LINE app.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wang had a problem with a man named Mr. Wang. In July and November of 2022, she asked Officer Chen to check if Mr. Wang had a criminal record or if police were looking for him. Officer Chen used a coworker's account to log into the police information system. He found Mr. Wang's criminal record and details about his car. Then, he sent this information to Ms. Wang.</p>
            <p>In another case, five people reported to the police that they had been tricked in virtual money scams. After the police took their reports, they wrote summaries of the cases and put them in a police LINE group for work. Officer Chen was in this group and saw the information. He then sent the victims' personal details to Ms. Wang using LINE.</p>
            <p>The National Police Agency looked into the case internally. After their investigation, they sent Officer Chen to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office. The prosecutors then investigated further. Based on what witnesses said and the chat messages on LINE, both Officer Chen and Ms. Wang were charged with breaking laws related to protecting personal information.</p>
