            <h1>Anthropic Increases AI Use Limits, Bans Chinese Holding Companies and Groups</h1>
            <p>The American technology company Anthropic said it will stop Chinese holding companies and organizations from using its artificial intelligence services. It will also make rules stronger for "authoritarian areas."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that this new company is worth 183 billion US dollars. It is famous for its Claude chatbot and its AI models. Amazon gives it a lot of help. Anthropic says it wants to make AI safe and develop it in a good way.</p>
            <p>Companies in places like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran could not use Anthropic's services for businesses before. This was because of laws and safety reasons.</p>
            <p>Anthropic said in a statement today that even with these rules, some groups "kept using our services. They did this through different ways, for example, through companies registered in other countries."</p>
            <p>The statement explained: "This new rule will stop companies or groups controlled by China and other areas where it is not allowed from using our products. This is true no matter where they actually work."</p>
            <p>"Companies controlled by authoritarian areas like China might have to share information because of laws. They might also have to work with spy groups or do other things that could cause national security issues."</p>
            <p>Anthropic said this change to its service rules will affect companies that are owned directly or indirectly by more than 50% by businesses in areas that are not supported.</p>
            <p>The statement said: "For AI to be developed safely and securely, everyone needs to work together to stop unfriendly groups with a lot of power from using it badly."</p>

            <h1>Students from "Study Abroad Program" Go to Cambodia to Help Humanitarian Groups</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education held a meeting today to share stories about its "Study Abroad Program." Yu Song-ai, a social work student from Shih Chien University, went to Cambodia. She worked as an intern at the Youth Empowerment Center (ACE). She helped a group that works with people in need in a poor area. She learned how to work and talk with people from different countries.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education praised 26 students at the "Study Abroad Program" sharing event. Yu Song-ai spoke about her time in the "New Southbound Study Dream" program. She told her story to other students who want to study or work abroad later.</p>
            <p>Yu Song-ai studies social work. She had volunteered in Myanmar for a short time before. This made her want to learn more about different cultures and see how people really live. This time, she used the Study Abroad Program to intern at ACE in Cambodia. Every day was new and challenging. She learned about the language, food, and weather. She also learned how to talk with the children there.</p>
            <p>In a project called "Hope Porridge," Yu Song-ai worked with friends from Singapore. They planned events. They held charity events and helped children in need with their homework in the poor area. Because the team members came from different cultures, they sometimes had different ideas and problems. This made her understand better how to see the good things in each team member. She also learned how to keep the team working well, even with little money and few things.</p>
            <p>Being away from home by herself, Yu Song-ai sometimes felt alone. The work was also very hard. She often had doubts about herself. But she also saw what she needed to learn and improve. She understood that real teamwork in a multicultural place only happens with honest talking. At the same time, she felt more sure that she wants to be a social worker in the future.</p>
            <p>Li Zhi-ying, a student who studies international business at Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, also shared her story. She was part of the "Study Abroad Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students." She went to Kurume University in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, for one year to study.</p>
            <p>Li Zhi-ying thanked the Study Abroad Program. It gives students from families with less money a chance to study in another country. She also talked about one class. In this class, she had to write and give a speech in Japanese. She chose the mascot of Kurume City as her topic. She even went to the city office to talk to the workers there. She learned about how the city advertises itself. Her Japanese skills also got much better. Her paper won the "Best Award" for that school term.</p>

            <h1>CarUX from Innolux Shows Augmented Reality Head-Up Display at Munich Auto Show</h1>
            <p>Innolux Corporation said today that its company, CarUX, will be at the IAA Mobility international car show in Munich, Germany. A special part of their display will be a screen system that stretches across the car from one side to the other, where the front window frame is. This system uses Micro LED technology to show extra information. This information appears naturally together with what the driver sees.</p>
            <p>The IAA Mobility international car show in Munich, Germany, will take place from September 8th to 12th. CarUX will show a new car interior design. It uses many new technologies for cars of the future.</p>
            <p>CarUX said that the Micro LED technology shown there will be very important for car screens in the future. It will be used in three main ways: First, it can project bright information clearly onto the front windshield, where you can see through. Second, it can put together many Micro LED screens without borders. This makes large and flexible display areas.</p>
            <p>Also, a clear screen technology makes augmented reality features look more natural inside the car's view.</p>
            <p>CarUX also mentioned new smart ways to use technology in the car's systems. For example, it has "Vital Sign Sensing" technology. This technology can put sensors exactly in the front part where passengers sit. These sensors check the driver's and passengers' body signs right away. This helps to make driving safer in a more complete way.</p>
