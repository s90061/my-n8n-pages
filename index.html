            <h1>Zelenskyy Meets Trump at White House, Wants to End Russia-Ukraine War Diplomatically</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy went to the White House today to talk with US President Trump. He thanked Trump for trying to stop Russia's attack on Ukraine. Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ready to end the war through talks. He wants Ukraine, Russia, and the US to talk together.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said Ukraine is attacked every day. He added, "We need to stop this war and stop Russia. We need help from the United States and our European friends."</p>
            <p>He mentioned that he is ready to meet with Trump and Russian President Putin. Trump has already said he wants to hold a meeting with all three soon after today's talks.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also thanked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for a new plan. This plan allows NATO countries to buy weapons from the US and send them to Ukraine. He said, "We thank them for this plan and this chance. We thank Europe, they are paying for this."</p>
            <p>Trump also praised this plan. He said it means the US is not giving anything directly to Ukraine. Instead, the US is selling its military equipment to Ukraine's allies.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked what safety guarantees Ukraine needs to reach an agreement, Zelenskyy said his country needs "everything."</p>
            <p>He explained that Ukraine first needs a strong army. This includes weapons, soldiers, training, and information. He said all of these things depend on "big countries" like the United States and other friends.</p>
            <p>Also, Zelenskyy gave Trump a letter. This letter was written by Ukraine's First Lady, Olena Zelenska, to America's First Lady, Melania Trump. He joked, "My wife, Ukraine's First Lady, she wrote this letter. But it is not for you, it is for your wife." This made the reporters present laugh.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Zelenskyy Meet; Trump May Send Troops to Ukraine for Peace</h1>
            <p>President Trump met with President Zelenskyy at the White House today. The meeting felt much calmer than their last public meeting, where they argued. They focused on answering reporters' questions. During the meeting, Trump said that both Europe and the US will help make sure there is lasting peace in Ukraine after the war. But he did not clearly say if US soldiers would stay there for peacekeeping. He said he might answer later today.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy returned to the White House today to talk with Trump about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. This was after US President Trump and Vice President Pence spoke sharply to him in public in February.</p>
            <p>People were very interested in this meeting because Trump had just met with Russian President Putin on August 15th at a military base in Alaska.</p>
            <p>When Trump and Zelenskyy briefly met reporters in the White House, Trump did not directly answer if US soldiers would be in Ukraine for peacekeeping.</p>
            <p>CNN said that Trump not ruling out sending US soldiers to Ukraine is a big change in US policy. It also goes against his promise during his election not to get US troops involved in foreign fights. For Ukraine, which has suffered a lot from the war, safety is key to any peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Trump said the US will work with Ukraine and everyone to make sure there is long-lasting peace. He said this is a long-term goal. "We are not talking about a two-year peace and then chaos again. We will make sure everything is good."</p>
            <p>When asked more about safety for Ukraine, Trump said any agreement after the war would give "a lot of help" for safety. But he said Europe would be the "first line of defense," and the US would also help.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Trump seemed to say no to Ukraine joining NATO in the future. This matches what he wrote earlier on social media. But he also told reporters that "there is no discussion about it right now."</p>
            <p>He said, "We will talk about this today, but we will give them very good protection, very good safety."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that European leaders waiting to meet him and Zelenskyy agree on this issue.</p>
            <p>Leaders from Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Finland, NATO, and the EU were all in Washington D.C. with Zelenskyy today.</p>
            <p>The BBC called this a "never-before-seen moment." They said European leaders felt a bit nervous after the US-Russia meeting.</p>
            <p>Trump also said today that after talking with Zelenskyy and European leaders, he would talk with Putin.</p>

            <h1>No More Arguments on Camera, but Zelenskyy Faces Hard Choices</h1>
            <p>Leaders from the US, Ukraine, and Europe met at the White House. Six months ago, US President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy argued openly. But today, they were much calmer. They did not talk much about what was reported from the US-Russia meeting. Both showed they wanted to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. After these two meetings, Zelenskyy will have difficult decisions to make.</p>
            <p>First, leaders from the European Union, NATO, and countries like the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Finland arrived at the White House. Then, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy arrived. He talked with Trump at the White House, and later the European leaders joined the talks.</p>
            <p>Both leaders answered reporters' questions on camera. Trump did most of the talking. He answered questions about a peace deal for the Russia-Ukraine war, what he talked about with Russian President Putin in Alaska, and safety in Washington D.C.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy was clearly more controlled. He thanked Trump many times for meeting Putin to help bring peace to Ukraine. He only gave short answers and did not speak for a long time or question the US position.</p>
            <p>Six months ago, Zelenskyy, Trump, and US Vice President Pence had a sharp argument in the same place. The Ukrainian group left the White House early. Now, everyone hopes for a ceasefire in Ukraine and wants peace. So, their second public meeting was calm, as expected.</p>
            <p>After the US and Russian presidents met, the White House told US media some things. They said Putin and Trump suggested that Ukraine give up land in the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine. They also suggested that Ukraine not join NATO. The US would offer Ukraine some safety promises. This plan would skip a ceasefire on the front lines and go straight to a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Ukraine has always said no to giving up or trading land. The US, with many European leaders, will talk about what happened in the "Trump-Putin meeting" with Ukraine. Zelenskyy is facing huge pressure, both from inside and outside his country, about war and peace, and about keeping his country's land or losing it. Some people in the US and Europe think that Putin clearly got the upper hand in the Alaska meeting. Trump did not say anything about more economic punishments for Russia.</p>
            <p>After the US-Russia meeting, the White House quickly set up a meeting for Trump with Ukraine and European leaders. During the questions, Trump said he would talk to Putin after his meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders. He hopes Ukraine and Russia will meet.</p>
