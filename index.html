            <h1>Japanese Star Uemura Kenshin Found Guilty of Assaulting Hong Kong Female Translator, Fined Nearly 60,000 NTD</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong, August 13 (CNA) - Uemura Kenshin, a 26-year-old former Japanese idol group member, was accused of touching a female translator's leg. This happened at a party after an event in Hong Kong in March. Today, a judge in Hong Kong's West Kowloon Court said he was guilty of indecent assault. He was fined 15,000 Hong Kong dollars (about 57,200 New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Uemura Kenshin was a member of the boy group ONE Nâ€™ONLY. He became very popular because of his role in the BL drama "Minors." His career was doing very well. However, in early March, after he and another actor from the drama, Motoshima Junsei, had their first overseas fan meeting in Hong Kong, news spread that he was arrested for touching a female translator in a restaurant.</p>
            <p>His company then announced that they ended his contract and removed him from the group. They said he had "broken his contract in a serious way." His Instagram account was also deleted, and all his future events were canceled. This made his fans very surprised and upset.</p>
            <p>Before the court hearing today, many fans waited for several hours in line to listen in court.</p>
            <p>According to reports from AFP, Ming Pao, and Hong Kong 01, Uemura was accused of touching the female translator's leg many times. He did not listen when she said no. He also asked her to go to the bathroom with him.</p>
            <p>Judge Yu Chun-xiang decided that Uemura intended to act badly. He said that Uemura's actions clearly did not respect women.</p>
            <p>After Uemura learned he was fined and would not go to jail, he hugged his male court interpreter. Some fans cried when they heard Uemura was found guilty.</p>

            <p>Taipei, August 13 (CNA) - Typhoon Yangliu is moving away. The weather agency said that Yangliu's strength has become weaker. At 11 PM, it weakened into a mild typhoon. Taiwan island is now out of the storm's circle. The land warning is only for Penghu and Kinmen now. Kinmen, in particular, still needs to watch out for strong wind and rain until early tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Administration, Typhoon Yangliu's center at 11 PM today was at 23.7 degrees North and 118.0 degrees East. This is about 90 kilometers southwest of Kinmen. It is moving northwest at a speed of 30 to 33 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>The weather agency said that Yangliu's strength became weaker in the last 3 hours. Its center is now near the sea southwest of Kinmen. It will move northwest. Taiwan island has left its storm circle. It still affects Penghu and Kinmen, with wind and rain continuing. It is expected that this typhoon's strength will continue to get weaker, and its storm circle will also get smaller.</p>
            <p>Weather forecaster Chu Mei-lin said in a press conference that Yangliu is moving northwest quickly. It is expected to reach China late tonight. Its strength will also slowly get weaker. Taiwan island is now out of the storm's circle. The land warning is only for Penghu and Kinmen. Kinmen still needs to watch out for strong wind and rain from tonight until early tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin said that the eastern part of Taiwan has winds from the south-southeast. So, Hualien and Taitung will still have heavy rain until tomorrow morning. Many strong rain clouds are forming on the east and south sides of Yangliu. Because of this, the southwestern coast and Penghu will still have rain that stops and starts.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin pointed out that after tomorrow morning, the rain will become less, and the weather will become stable. Most places will be partly cloudy to sunny.
