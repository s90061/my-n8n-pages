The world is quickly building more solar and wind power plants to fight climate change. However, this fast growth is putting a lot of pressure on the old electricity systems, or "power grids." These grids were designed for big power stations that use fossil fuels, not for the changing energy from solar and wind, which depends on the weather. This means that even when new green power is ready, it can't always connect to the grid right away.

Countries need to spend huge amounts of money to make their grids smarter and stronger. This includes building new, modern power lines and large batteries to store energy when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. If these upgrades don't happen quickly, it will slow down our move away from fossil fuels. This could make it harder to reach important climate goals. Investing in better grids is now seen as just as important as building new renewable energy sources themselves.

**Many Companies Continue Four-Day Work Week After Successful Trials**

A recent study shows that most companies that tried a four-day work week are continuing with it. This news comes after a large pilot program that involved many businesses around the world. The aim was to see if employees could work less but still produce the same amount, or even more. The results were mostly positive, leading many companies to make the shorter week a permanent change.

Employees in the trial reported feeling much less stressed and healthier overall. They also said they had a better balance between their work and personal lives. For the companies, the trials showed that productivity usually stayed the same, and sometimes even increased. This happened because employees were more motivated and focused during their four working days. This success suggests that the four-day work week could become a more common way of working in the future, changing daily life for many.

**New Technologies Fight Growing Ocean Plastic Pollution**

The problem of plastic waste in our oceans is getting worse, with millions of tons of plastic entering the sea every year. This pollution seriously harms marine animals and damages the natural environments they live in. Scientists and inventors are working hard to find new ways to clean up the oceans and stop the problem from growing.

One promising solution involves new technologies that can collect plastic from rivers before it reaches the sea. Other innovations include advanced recycling methods that can turn more types of plastic waste into new products. There are also efforts to develop plastics that break down naturally and quickly in the environment. While these new technologies offer hope, experts agree that we also need to change how we use and throw away plastic in our daily lives to truly protect Earth's oceans.`;
