            <h1>IAEA Head Visits Singapore, Signs Agreement for Nuclear Training in the Region</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Wu Sheng-hung, Singapore, July 26) The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, visited Singapore. He signed an agreement with officials to help countries in the region with nuclear power. Officials in Singapore said that Singapore actively helps to promote and keep high standards for nuclear safety.</p>
            <p>News reports, including Lianhe Zaobao, said that Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu, and IAEA head Rafael Mariano Grossi signed an agreement yesterday evening. This updates the Third Country Training Programme. They hope to make nuclear capabilities stronger in the region. This includes better ways to check and study radiation in the environment.</p>
            <p>Singapore and the IAEA last worked together on the Third Country Training Programme from 2015 to 2020. They offered training and programs to over 140 people from 27 countries. The training was about nuclear medicine, nuclear laws, food safety, and controlling pests. For the next five years, the IAEA and Singapore will continue to plan training. This will improve skills in areas like human health, radiation in industry, and checking radiation in the environment.</p>
            <p>The report said that Singapore joined the IAEA in 1967. Since then, Singapore has been a member of the agency's board five times. It promotes using nuclear technology in a safe and peaceful way. Minister Fu said that Singapore supports the IAEA's work to use nuclear energy safely, reliably, and peacefully around the world. As a responsible country, Singapore actively helps the IAEA at both regional and global levels to promote and keep high standards for nuclear safety.</p>
            <p>Grossi gave a talk at the National University of Singapore. After the talk, he said that the IAEA's work is growing. The updated plan with Singapore will make sure their cooperation covers new areas. This was Grossi's first visit to Singapore. He met with Singapore's President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, and other officials in charge of energy and technology.</p>
            <p>The report noted that Singapore has not decided yet if it will use nuclear energy. But it might use nuclear energy in the future if the technology becomes safe and possible. Grossi said that ASEAN countries are looking into different ways to make nuclear power. He added that Singapore has the right technology and systems.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Wong wrote on Facebook that Singapore will continue to work with the IAEA. This is to improve its abilities and keep strict safety rules as it looks for energy options that produce less carbon. (Edited by Tang Sheng-yang) July 26, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Online Group with Over 100,000 Members Shared Secretly Filmed Videos, Including Minors</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Hsieh Yi-hsuan, Beijing, July 26) Recently, Chinese internet users said on social media that a group called "MaskPark Shudong Forum" was sharing secretly filmed videos. This group had more than 100,000 Chinese men in it. The videos showed strangers and women they knew being filmed in public without their knowledge. This topic was discussed much more on Weibo than the top trending topic. But it did not appear on the trending list, which suggests the platform may have stopped it from being seen.</p>
            <p>According to a report by Southern Metropolis Daily on July 25, many users on Chinese social media said that an online group from outside China, "MaskPark Shudong Forum," was sharing secretly filmed videos. This group has more than 100,000 Chinese men. This group also has 20 smaller groups, all related to adult content. The largest of these smaller groups has as many as 900,000 members.</p>
            <p>Some users claimed that people in the group would upload videos of unknown women filmed secretly. Pictures they showed proved that tiny cameras were sold within the group. These cameras were hidden in things like water cups and lighters. Some cameras recorded for 24 hours without stopping. The filming happened in places like public toilets, subways, and shopping malls. The people who were filmed were of many different ages, and even children were secretly filmed. Also, some users willingly uploaded private photos of their ex-girlfriends, girlfriends, wives, daughters, and other family members.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned what a person who knew about it, named momo, said. She said that this group shared many videos of private parts of strangers. Some of these private videos could be sold for money. At the same time, this led to a business of selling hidden cameras. "People who joined the group would contact sellers to buy hidden cameras themselves. Before, you could find about 10 or more such groups. The biggest one had 220,000 members."</p>
            <p>The report noted that this event was a trending topic on social media on July 18 and 23. The group then quickly put up a backup website in case the main one was shut down. Now, the biggest "MaskPark Shudong Forum" group has been closed. However, the person who knew about it said that many smaller groups still exist.</p>
            <p>One victim said that in May this year, she got a message from an unknown account. The message said the person had her private videos and photos. It also gave her the website address for the "MaskPark Shudong Forum" group. She found that her private photos, videos, and social media accounts had been put into the group by her ex-boyfriend.</p>
            <p>The victim said that her ex-boyfriend had deleted the proof, so the police investigation later did not lead to anything. She said that the users in the group were very careful. They were not allowed to take screenshots of the chats in the group. All members of the group were anonymous and only talked using IDs. This made it very hard to find out who they were.</p>
            <p>She saw that at the start of May, there were more than 80,000 members. By the end of June, before the event was widely known, the number of members had gone over 100,000.</p>
            <p>The Beijing News published a comment yesterday. It said that even though the Telegram company and its servers are outside China, and anonymous IDs make it hard to find criminals, many people involved in this caseâ€”uploaders, sharers, those making money, and victimsâ€”might be inside China. So, Chinese laws should apply to them. Those who are suspected of crimes "should be caught quickly."</p>
            <p>Right now, many people on Chinese social media are asking for more Chinese news outlets to report on this matter. Many users also mentioned the "Little Cabbage" event in China in 2022. They also talked about the BBC's report in 2023 about a group of Chinese men selling secretly filmed videos. They are asking for more attention to the problem of secret filming.</p>
            <p>Three years ago, Phoenix Weekly reported that there was an online group in China called "Little Cabbage." It had about 50,000 members. Users in this group called underage girls "little cabbages." They would talk to these young girls and then ask them to show private photos. After that, they would sell these private photos inside the group.</p>
            <p>A BBC report in 2023 showed that Chinese people in Japan were selling videos of a type called "chikan," which are rude and unwanted videos. These videos were usually filmed in public places like subways and buses. They were filmed in places like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The people running the site got 30 to 100 videos each month from people in China. The website had over 10,000 members who paid money, and most of them were Chinese men.</p>
            <p>As of noon today, the hashtag "Foreign forum spreading large amounts of private photos of Chinese women" had 250 million views and 260,000 discussions on Weibo. But it was not on the trending list. The top trending topic on Weibo only had 120 million views and 38,000 discussions. (Edited by Chang Shu-ling) July 26, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Election Worker Fired for Stamping Voters' Seals to Count People</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Chang Chi, Hualien County, July 26) Today, people voted in the recall election for a lawmaker. At the polling station in Fengshan Activity Center in Hualien, an election worker used voters' seals on a separate A4 paper. The worker said this was to count how many people voted. People questioned if this was "to check on citizens." The Hualien County Election Commission said the worker has been fired right away.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-yu, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party, heard from people that an election worker at the Fengshan Activity Center polling station in Hualien took voters' seals. After stamping them on the voter list, the worker then stamped them again on a nearby A4 paper. The worker said this was to count the number of voters.</p>
            <p>Voters at the polling station raised their concerns. The election worker replied, "All the papers will be taken back to the election center, and they have no legal power." People asked for the papers to be destroyed right there. The election worker then said, "The election center has already taken them and will deal with them later. Thank you for your concern and reminder."</p>
            <p>People who complained asked if the election worker misunderstood or if a supervisor told them to do this. They questioned, "Is this meant to keep track of people? Such an act is bad for democracy and the rule of law. Hualien is really too much."</p>
            <p>Regarding the public's accusations, Li Wei, the head of the Hualien County Election Commission, told the media that the election worker was in charge of the polling station. After voters get their ballots, election workers usually stamp or sign the voter list. This helps to count how many people voted. But stamping on a blank paper was likely the worker's own idea, and it was the first time they heard of such a thing. They think it might be because the worker did not have enough work experience.</p>
            <p>Li Wei said that around 1 PM, the election worker was fired and replaced. Evidence has been kept safe, and a special committee will meet to decide what to do. Also, this action might break personal data laws or interfere with voting. The information will be put together and sent to the prosecutor's office. (Edited by Huang Shih-ya) July 26, 2025.</p>
