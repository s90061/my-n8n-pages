            <h1>Taiwanese Woman Becomes Interpreter in Italy, Hopes to Share Culture</h1>
            <p>A Taiwanese woman with cool hair often works at big international meetings and business talks in Italy. She can speak Chinese, Italian, and English very well. Her name is Hsiao Nai-yen, and she has been a full-time interpreter in Italy for 10 years. For her, this job is more than just changing words from one language to another. It is also about sharing and connecting different cultures, which is what she has always wanted to do since she was a child.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Nai-yen is 31 years old this year. She studied Italian at Fu Jen Catholic University. In 2015, she started working as a full-time interpreter in Italy. She told Central News Agency that she has not met any other full-time Taiwanese interpreters in Italy yet. This shows how special her job is.</p>
            <h2>Biggest Challenge: Different Topics, from Medicine to Food</h2>
            <p>Hsiao Nai-yen was very good at learning foreign languages from a young age. She believes that living in a country where the language is spoken is the most important part of learning. She studied in Rome for 8 months during college. She was surprised that her speaking skills improved much more than in three years of studying in Taiwan. While traveling in Europe, she saw many international meetings that needed a lot of interpreters. This made her want to do this job. So, after she finished university, she went to Italy to study more and become an interpreter.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Nai-yen said, "The biggest challenge of being an interpreter is that the topics are always different. Today I might work at a dentist meeting, two days later a food show, and then a business meeting or a visit from a government group. The jobs are in many different areas." She thinks that changing between languages is not the hardest part. Understanding the special words and terms for each field is what truly shows her professional skill, like the saying, "one minute on stage means ten years of hard work off stage."</p>
            <p>Hsiao Nai-yen explained that interpreting needs a lot of preparation. You need to know about different industries or the backgrounds of the two companies in a business talk. If it's a food show, you need to understand the special qualities of different foods and what the chef wants to express with each dish. She said, "I wouldn't call it difficult, but it's a challenge. This challenge helps me keep getting better."</p>
            <h2>Machines Don't Understand Human Jokes; AI Can't Fully Replace Interpreters</h2>
            <p>As artificial intelligence (AI) gets better, some people think that translation jobs will be the first to disappear. But Hsiao Nai-yen is not worried. She thinks that AI translation is mostly "direct word change." It is still hard for AI to truly understand the cultural meaning of words. This is especially true for Chinese, which does not have very strict grammar rules. The same sentence can have different meanings in different situations or places.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Nai-yen said, "For example, when someone praises you, Chinese people often answer humbly, 'No, not really.' If a machine translates this directly as a negative sentence, the meaning would be very different." She added that choosing the right word when translating can make a big difference in important talks. A small mistake can cause a deal to succeed or fail.</p>
            <p>She explained that interpreters must accurately say what both sides mean. But in difficult situations, like diplomatic talks, human judgment is needed. You must consider the tone of voice and the goals of your side in the discussion. "If people start to use aggressive words, you need to be very careful about how much you translate. If a mistake in translation causes a misunderstanding or makes the other side angry, the talk could break down."</p>
            <p>Hsiao Nai-yen said that even professional interpreters need special training and a lot of experience to understand the mood in a room. AI cannot easily do these detailed tasks right now. Also, if AI makes a mistake, someone who knows the languages needs to fix it.</p>
            <h2>Interpreting Had a Good Ten Years, but After the Pandemic, Prices Dropped</h2>
            <p>The Chinese-Italian interpreting market has busy and slow times. It's usually slower in the summer or during Chinese New Year. Hsiao Nai-yen usually has 3 jobs a month, but sometimes she has 5 to 10. However, she feels sad that she worked during the "golden ten years" of interpreting. After the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses started to focus on saving money. They would choose cheaper options or hire non-professional interpreters, not caring as much about quality.</p>
            <p>In Italian companies, it's also common to hire friends or family. Hsiao Nai-yen said that if a company needs an interpreter, they often find a relative or friend who speaks English. But just speaking a language doesn't mean you can interpret. Interpreting has many small tricks that people who haven't learned the skills find hard to do.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Nai-yen also noticed that after the pandemic, many companies and government offices would choose to save money over quality. They would pick interpreters with lower prices, not looking at their experience or background.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Nai-yen said, "Translation is a very specific market, and we should respect everyone's choices. But I often get jobs where I have to fix mistakes because the results were not good, or the message was not given correctly. In the end, they still need a professional interpreter." She said that recently, she often gets these "clean-up" jobs. The client might even have to pay for an interpreter twice. So, she hopes that more people will understand and respect how professional interpreting is.</p>

            <h1>German County Mayor from "German Hollywood" Visits Taiwan, Hopes for Semiconductor Investment</h1>
            <p>A group of 60 people from the German state of Saxony will travel to Taiwan this weekend. They will have many meetings about business and education. The County Mayor of GÃ¶rlitz, Stephan Meyer, will also join the group. GÃ¶rlitz is known as "German Hollywood." He hopes to get investments and workers from Taiwan for the semiconductor industry by showing how welcoming his area is.</p>
            <p>GÃ¶rlitz County is in the very east of Germany, next to Poland and the Czech Republic. For a long time after Germany became one country again, many people left the area, and there were not enough workers. Last year, TSMC, a big chip company, said it would build a factory in Dresden. GÃ¶rlitz County is about an hour's drive from this factory. The county saw this as a chance to grow and is now actively inviting Taiwan to join the semiconductor growth happening around Dresden.</p>
            <p>The group of 60 people is led by Michael Kretschmer, the head of Saxony state. They started their visit to Taiwan today. The group includes the Minister of Economy, Dirk Panter, the Minister of Science, Sebastian Gemkow, and members of the state parliament. Stephan Meyer is the only county mayor from Saxony's five counties who is visiting Taiwan with the group.</p>
            <p>According to the local newspaper, SÃ¤chsische Zeitung, Mayor Meyer brought English brochures. These brochures list industrial areas and buildings in GÃ¶rlitz County that are good for factories. Before his trip, he also asked the Taiwanese office in Germany about what kind of investments Taiwan might need.</p>
            <p>Meyer said that GÃ¶rlitz wants to create a place where foreign skilled workers want to stay. He believes that only if international workers feel safe and respected in their daily lives can the area truly benefit from the growth of the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>In Germany, the phrase "welcoming culture" (Willkommenskultur) first described how German society welcomed refugees when many arrived in Europe in 2015. Now, local governments and businesses also use it to mean a friendly living and social environment that is needed to keep foreign skilled workers.</p>
            <p>The AfD (Alternative for Germany) party, which is against immigration, became the second-largest party in Germany after this year's national election. This makes foreign people more worried about facing discrimination or unfriendly treatment when working in Germany. Because of this political situation, the efforts of local governments to create a "welcoming culture" are seen as very important for attracting international workers.</p>
            <p>Because of this, Mayor Meyer has been actively promoting a "welcoming culture" since he started his job. He has made the intercultural week bigger. Last year, he even held a "Taiwan Day" during this week. Through exhibitions, talks, and market events, local students and people could learn about Taiwan in different ways.</p>
            <p>GÃ¶rlitz is called "German Hollywood" because it has many old buildings that are well-preserved, from the Middle Ages to modern times. Many international films, like "The Grand Budapest Hotel" and "Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore," are filmed there every year. The county government also hopes to use this cultural feature to show a friendly "welcoming culture" to international workers.</p>
            <p>When he was a student, Meyer visited Taiwan with the youth group of the CDU party. He feels a connection to Taiwan. Last year, he reached out to the Taipei office in Germany. He is the most active local leader in Saxony who wants to work more with Taiwan and get Taiwanese semiconductor investments and workers because of TSMC building a factory in Germany.</p>

            <h1>Stampede at Indian Political Event Kills 36</h1>
            <p>New Delhi, September 27 (Central News Agency) â€“ The head of Tamil Nadu state in India said that a large crowd event for the famous actor-turned-politician Vijay caused a stampede today. At least 36 people died, and about 58 people were hurt.</p>
            <p>The state head, M.K. Stalin, wrote on social media site X, "I am very sad to hear that 36 people have died, including 8 children and 16 women."</p>
            <p>Another politician, V. Senthilbalaji, said that around 58 people were hurt and have been taken to the hospital for help.</p>
            <p>Vijay, who uses only one name, was speaking to a large crowd when things became messy. He had to stop his speech.</p>
            <p>The 51-year-old said that his "heart is broken" because of this sad event.</p>
            <p>Vijay wrote on social media X, "I send my deepest sadness and care to the families of my dear brothers and sisters who died in Karur County."</p>
            <p>The Hindustan Times newspaper reported that a very big crowd pushed hard against the fence near the stage to see Vijay. This caused the stampede.</p>
            <p>State head Stalin has ordered a group, led by a retired judge, to look into "this sad event." He also said that the families of those who died will receive 1 million rupees (about 340,000 New Taiwan dollars) as payment.</p>
            <p>India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, said that the event was "very sad."</p>
            <p>He wrote on social media, "My thoughts are with the families who lost their loved ones. I hope they can be strong during this hard time."</p>
