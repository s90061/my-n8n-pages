            <h1>Putin: Russia will respond to China's visa-free policy in a similar way</h1>
            <p>China's government recently said that from September 15 this year to September 14, 2026, people from Russia with normal passports can visit China without a visa for 30 days. On September 4, Russian President Putin said that Russia would do the same thing for Chinese citizens, matching China's policy.</p>
            <p>Russian news reported on September 4 that the 10th Eastern Economic Forum was happening in Vladivostok, Russia, from September 3 to 6. Putin met with Li Hongzhong, who is an important leader in China's government. Putin thanked China's leaders for allowing Russian citizens to visit without a visa for a trial period.</p>
            <p>Putin said, "Please tell the Chinese leaders and our friend, President Xi Jinping, that Russia will definitely respond to this friendly action in the same way. We will also have the same policy."</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced the new policy on September 2. He said that because the leaders of China and Russia work together closely, the relationship between the two countries is "at a high level."</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun also said that China thinks it is very important to make it easier for people from both countries to visit each other. China supports more contact between the two peoples. This helps the "strong strategic partnership between China and Russia in the new era." Putin was visiting China when this was announced.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Water Dance Festival starts on September 13, Rainbow Bridge will shine for 37 days</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Water Dance Festival will happen from September 13 to October 19. It will last for 37 days. Every evening, there will be five water dance shows that include the Rainbow Bridge at Cikou Wharf. The city government reminds people that the Rainbow Bridge will be closed during the shows. This is to stop water from spraying on people.</p>
            <p>Taipei City's Department of Information and Tourism said today that this year's event will have water dances, light shows, and water screen shows, just like last year. They are also adding a new platform on the Keelung River that will have two water screens, 120 meters long. From September 13 to October 19, there will be a 5-minute water dance show every 30 minutes, from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM.</p>
            <p>The department said that this year's event is bigger and has better effects. On September 13, for the opening, and on October 4, for the "Chase Love Music Festival," there will be special "water and fire dances" and "people and water dances." These will be fun for both your eyes and ears.</p>
            <p>Also, the department said that during the festival, there will be light decorations along the river every afternoon and evening. Two big cartoon characters, like Bluey, Hey Duggee, and Peppa Pig, will take turns being displayed. Every Saturday, there will also be performers from the YOYO family and other groups.</p>
            <p>The Cikou Ferry Terminal on the Keelung River, near Songhe Road Gate No. 4, was a very busy place for trade and goods a long time ago. The Rainbow Bridge, which connects Neihu District and Songshan District, was finished at the end of 2007. It is 4.5 meters wide and 167 meters long. Only people walking and riding bicycles can use it.</p>
            <p>The Department of Information and Tourism wants to remind everyone that to stop water from spraying on people during the shows, the Rainbow Bridge will be closed in both directions 5 minutes before each show. It will open again after the show ends. Please be careful.</p>

            <h1>Qi Hong, the person behind the Chongqing slogan: I acted because I was sad and angry, but I do not hate (Interview)</h1>
            <p>Qi Hong, the man who put up anti-government signs in Chongqing, said that deciding to act is the most important thing. He said, "Why should I worry so much? I don't like to just accept things. Instead, I feel more sad and angry." Unlike many people in China who have done random attacks in the last two years, he was brave and clever. He did not want revenge or to hate.</p>
            <p>On August 29, big anti-government signs were shown on the wall of a building in Chongqing University Town. This event surprised people in China and other countries. It was surprising because it happened openly in China, where there are many cameras, and the person who did it was not caught.</p>
            <p>One week later, Qi Hong, who is in the UK, is still not back to his normal life. He told a news reporter that he has lost more than 5 kilograms and his wife looks worried. They are mainly afraid of causing trouble for their friends and family. Two friends in Chongqing have already been taken away for questions.</p>
            <p>Before the event, he had already taken his wife and two children to the UK. Then, he used a computer to control the projector from far away. No one knew about his plan before, not even his wife. He said, "If anyone knew, it would be dangerous. It's better if no one knows. If anyone knew, it would make it more dangerous for me." He also said that when he left China, he told his family he might not come back.</p>
            <p>The big signs he projected said things like: "Down with Red Fascism, stop the Communist Party's cruel rule!" "Only without the Communist Party can there be a new China. Freedom is not given; you must take it back!" "Wake up, people who do not want to be slaves! Stand up and fight for your rights!" "No lies, only truth. No slavery, only freedom. The Communist Party's bad government must go!"</p>
            <p>The police took about 50 minutes to find the projector in a hotel room. Cameras in the room showed police rushing in and quickly turning off the projector. The police also found a letter Qi Hong left for them. In the letter, he wrote: "Maybe you are getting benefits now, but one day in this country, you will surely suffer." He asked them not to "help bad people."</p>
            <p>The anti-government signs on the Chongqing building, the letter to the police, and the video of police entering the hotel room were put online a few hours later. Through online accounts, the videos were shared many times. The whole world knew what happened. Even though people in China could not talk about it openly, some small news sites posted short articles the next day with titles like "Respect to the brave person."</p>
            <p>Qi Hong told a news reporter on the phone that even very strict security systems have weak points. He said, "Technology for watching people works both ways. The government watches us, but we can also watch them." He said that technology gives more ways and chances to protest. However, he did not use any special high technology. He used a machine to make the slides and remote control for the equipment. These are common things you can buy.</p>
            <p>After this event, he believes the government will change how it keeps order. For example, they might check hotel registrations more carefully. But he said that unless the government stops everyone from staying in hotels, stops people from going abroad, stops selling knives, or stops selling projectors â€“ "unless society completely stops working, like during a lockdown" â€“ then these kinds of things cannot be stopped.</p>
            <p>This protest against the government was not a sudden act. Qi Hong usually speaks his mind. Every year on June 4th (the day of the Tiananmen Square incident), he posts on social media, but "friends don't dare to click 'like'."</p>
            <p>Qi Hong was born in a village in 1982. He left school at 16 to work. Because he did not have a temporary ID card, police arrested and beat him many times in Guangdong and Beijing when he was young. Later, he settled in Beijing. Because of problems with his children's schooling, he learned about smart people like Xu Zhiyong and many lawyers who fight for rights. They openly asked the government to follow laws and rules. At first, Qi Hong felt these educated people were very different from him, but his ideas slowly changed.</p>
            <p>Xu Zhiyong is still in prison today. In 2000, he started a group to help people's rights and the right to education for children of new families in cities.</p>
            <p>Qi Hong said that when he was young, he felt treated unfairly and helpless. People used to want to get back at others when they were treated badly. But later, he learned about smart people and lawyers who fight for rights. He also studied Buddhism, which taught him not to hate.</p>
            <p>He showed some understanding for the increasing number of random attacks in Chinese society in the last two years. He said, "I believe they don't want to hurt others when things are normal." But when he thought about these problems and acted, he was more thoughtful and also thought about being safe.</p>
            <p>The direct reason for his action was partly inspired by Peng Lifafa, the "brave man of Beijing's Sitong Bridge" who put up protest banners. Qi Hong also felt that living in China had no more meaning. He "felt like he couldn't breathe. This life did not match what he wanted and what life itself should be. He lived without hope."</p>
            <p>He thinks that protesting is not hard. The key is to decide to do it. "Why worry so much? I don't like to just accept things. Instead, I feel more sad and angry about how all kinds of people are treated." Studying Buddhism also made him feel more sympathy for people living in China. He felt more how the Communist Party's system affects people's minds and bodies. However, he did not think this action would have such a big effect, and he does not see himself as a hero.</p>
            <p>Qi Hong has never been to Taiwan. He learned from different news that Taiwan has kept some old Chinese culture. In mainland China, Taiwan's democracy is often called "very messy." But he thinks it is good to allow different ideas. He said, "Here, we only have one opinion. Voting just means 'yes, yes'." He also said that people in Taiwan don't have to bow down to government officials. Ordinary people are very free and brave to say what they think.</p>
            <p>When he left China this time, he did not think about going to Taiwan. He knew that Taiwan's laws usually do not let people from mainland China come to seek safety. Also, he heard that many people from Hong Kong did not get the help they expected in Taiwan. Because of the disagreements between Taiwan and mainland China, he knew that as a Chinese person, he would face problems in Taiwan right now.</p>
            <p>Qi Hong said that even though the Chinese Communist Party does threaten Taiwan, and he understands this makes people afraid, he does not agree with creating conflict. He feels that Taiwanese people are like family. They share the same language, writing, and similar culture. His grandfather was even an officer in the KMT army. "Ordinary people in Taiwan don't need to hate people from mainland China. Even though some mainland Chinese people are tricked, they are also victims," he said. He strongly dislikes creating hatred because it is not helpful.</p>
            <p>Now, Qi Hong's family is in the UK. Many things about their future are not clear, and he does not talk much about it. "I definitely cannot go back to mainland China. Even if they let me, I definitely would not go back. Going there, there's no difference between being alive or dead." He said many things need time, and he hopes to keep learning new things in his new home.</p>
