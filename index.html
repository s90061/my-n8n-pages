            <h1>Man Falls from Electric Scooter, Becomes Paralyzed; Taipei City Office Does Not Have to Pay</h1>
            <p>A man named Hou was riding an electric scooter in Taipei. He hit a pothole and fell, which made him unable to move his arms and legs. He asked the government for money because of this. A first court said that the Taipei City New Construction Office should pay him 4.67 million NT dollars. But a second court has now decided that Mr. Hou was taking a risk by riding the scooter on the road in a wrong way. So, today the court changed the decision, and the office does not have to pay. Mr. Hou can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>This case happened on January 28, 2019, in the afternoon. Mr. Hou was riding his electric scooter out of an alley near National Taiwan University. He wanted to cross the road to go to the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology parking lot. The road was not flat, and there was a pothole and different ground levels. His scooter's front wheel hit the pothole, and he flew off. He hit a metal bolt at the bottom of a lamppost and became unconscious.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hou was taken to Wanfang Hospital for almost 10 hours of emergency surgery. Doctors said he had a head injury, his neck and spinal cord were completely hurt, and he could not move his arms and legs. He stayed in the hospital until December 28, 2019, and then went home to rest.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hou sued, saying that his central nervous system was badly damaged. He cannot work for the rest of his life and still cannot move his arms and legs from the neck down. He needs someone to take care of him 24 hours a day. He asked the Taipei City Public Works Department's New Construction Office and National Taiwan University to pay him more than 25.76 million NT dollars.</p>
            <p>The first court in Taipei thought that the New Construction Office did not manage the road well enough where the accident happened. However, the court also thought that Mr. Hou used a scooter that should be for parks or open areas, and he rode it on the road towards the sidewalk. This was already dangerous. He fell and hit a lamppost base, which made him paralyzed. This showed he was riding the scooter fast. So, he should be responsible for 80% of the accident. The court decided that the New Construction Office should pay 4,676,955 NT dollars, and National Taiwan University did not have to pay.</p>
            <p>The case went to a higher court, the Taiwan High Court, for a second trial. The High Court announced its decision today. The High Court said that at the time of the accident, electric scooters were not allowed on roads or inside National Taiwan University. The scooter's user manual also clearly stated, "Do not ride on public roads."</p>
            <p>The second court decided that Mr. Hou riding the scooter on the road was a risky action that did not follow road rules. This kind of action is not covered by rules for road maintenance. Therefore, the Taipei City New Construction Office and National Taiwan University do not have to pay government compensation.</p>
            <p>The second court's decision also said that the place where the accident happened was supposed to be a sidewalk without cover. It was also a driveway for cars and bicycles entering National Taiwan University. Cars also used this path. If someone drove through the dip in a normal way, it would not be dangerous.</p>
            <p>According to the decision, the court found that Mr. Hou rode his scooter in the wrong direction out of National Taiwan University and made a sharp turn onto the sidewalk. The dip in the road would not usually cause an accident. So, there was no strong link between the dip and Mr. Hou's injuries. The court changed the decision to no government compensation.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Man Seriously Injures Ex-Girlfriend with a Stick on the Street; Prosecutors Ask for a Strong Punishment</h1>
            <p>In Kaohsiung, a man named Chen was angry because his ex-girlfriend, Ms. Wu, met with another man. He thought she had cheated, which led to their breakup. So, on July 25 this year, he used a stick to chase and hit her on the street. Ms. Wu was in great danger. Prosecutors in Kaohsiung have now charged him with attempted murder and asked the Kaohsiung District Court to give him a very strong punishment.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office said that Mr. Chen, 47, and Ms. Wu, 48, used to be a couple. But Mr. Chen was unhappy that Ms. Wu met with other men. He believed she had cheated, which caused them to break up. On the morning of July 25 this year, they met in an alley on Hankou Street in Sanmin District to talk. But Mr. Chen surprisingly used a wooden stick to chase and hit Ms. Wu on the street. She had many open wounds and changes to her head and body. She was taken to the hospital and was in critical condition for some time.</p>
            <p>After the police got the report, they arrested Mr. Chen within two hours. The case was sent to the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office to be investigated for attempted murder. The prosecutors also asked for Mr. Chen to be held in custody. The Kaohsiung District Court decided that night to keep him in custody.</p>
            <p>After finishing their investigation, the prosecutors said that Mr. Chen's violent actions were very serious and greatly affected public safety. They charged him with attempted murder and asked the Kaohsiung District Court to give him a severe sentence to uphold the rule of law.</p>
