            <h1>Trump Calls Supporters "Stupid" Over Epstein Case Disagreement</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 16 (CNA) The way the U.S. government handled the sex scandal of the rich man Jeffrey Epstein has made many people angry. These are mostly loyal supporters of President Trump. Today, Trump strongly criticized his own supporters and some "stupid" Republicans. He also kept criticizing anyone who questioned how the government managed the case.</p>
            <p>News agencies like AFP reported that Trump is facing a big disagreement within his own group. His most loyal supporters, called "Make America Great Again" (MAGA), think that Trump's government is hiding details about Epstein's crimes. They believe this is to protect powerful people who are involved in the case.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump told reporters in the White House that "This is all a big trick. Democrats are behind it. Some stupid Republicans fell for it, and now they are helping the Democrats."</p>
            <p>Also, Trump wrote a long message on his social media site, Truth Social. He said, "My 'former' supporters completely believe these 'lies.' Let them go. Let these weak people work for the Democrats... I don't need their support anymore."</p>
            <p>Many MAGA supporters have long believed that a "Deep State" wants to keep a list of powerful people involved in the Epstein case secret. They are afraid that if the list comes out, it will harm them.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Trump and others promised to show the truth about Epstein's death and the hidden facts of the case. They also promised to make the rumored "client list" public. But now, things are changing.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Epstein was accused by the government of arranging sex for underage people. He died by suicide in prison while waiting for his trial. Pam Bondi, the Attorney General, started an investigation this year. Last week, she said that Epstein did kill himself and that there is no "client list." She also said that the government will not share more information about the case. This news surprised and angered many MAGA supporters.</p>
