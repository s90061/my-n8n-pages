            <h1>Trump Puts More Pressure on the Federal Reserve, Calls for Governor Cook to Resign Immediately</h1>
            <p>After criticizing the head of the Federal Reserve (Fed), Jerome Powell, for not lowering interest rates sooner, US President Donald Trump today put more pressure on the Fed. He posted online, asking Governor Lisa Cook to leave her job right away.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," "Cook must resign NOW!" He also shared a news report from Bloomberg News. This report was about Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, asking for an investigation into Cook for two home loans.</p>
            <p>Pulte is a strong supporter of Trump. Reports say he sent a letter to the US Attorney General. In the letter, he suggested that Cook might have done something criminal and asked for an investigation into her.</p>
            <p>It is not clear yet if this investigation will happen.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve has kept its main lending interest rate the same this year. Before Trump started focusing on Cook, who is a member of the Fed's committee that decides interest rates, he had often criticized Powell.</p>
            <p>Cook became a Fed Governor in May 2022. She was appointed again in September the next year and started her new term that same month. Her term will last until 2038.</p>

            <h1>Pixel 10 Phones to Use TSMC's 3nm Chip for the First Time to Compete in AI Phone Market</h1>
            <p>Today in New York, Google held a big event to show its new products. The main phones, the Pixel 10 series, have Google's own AI chip called Tensor G5. This chip is made using TSMC's 3-nanometer technology. This is the biggest improvement to Google's phone chips ever. Google hopes to get a bigger share of the AI phone market by offering very smooth and natural AI features.</p>
            <p>Last year was the start of AI phones. After Google's Pixel 9 series, other brands like Apple's iPhone 16 series and Samsung's Galaxy S25 series also made AI features standard. Each company has its own special software and hardware.</p>
            <p>Google products have an advantage because they are "AI-native." This means they can connect their own chips, the Gemini AI model, Android operating system, and cloud services. This helps hardware and software work together very well. This is the main difference between Google and other brands.</p>
            <p>This year, Google has made big improvements to its chips. Before, Google worked with Samsung for the design and making of its chips. But now, Google leads the design of the Tensor G5. It uses TSMC's advanced 3-nanometer technology. This is a very important change.</p>
            <p>The improved chip also makes the phone's AI much stronger. Here are the main new AI features of the Google Pixel 10 series:</p>
            <p>‚óè Voice AI Assistant Gets Better: Can Mark Important Points and Talk More Like a Real Person</p>
            <p>The Pixel 10 series' voice AI assistant, Gemini Live, now has a new feature called "visual overlay." This feature uses the camera or screen to see what the user sees. Then, it can mark important objects or information on the screen and give instant help. This can be used in many situations. For example, if you are driving in another country and don't understand a road sign, you can use it to know if you can park there.</p>
            <p>Also, Gemini Live uses a "native audio model" to make conversations more natural. The AI can sense how the user feels and change its tone and answer automatically. This feature works in Taiwan and supports Traditional Chinese.</p>
            <p>‚óè Real-time Call Translation: Keeps a Similar Voice to the User</p>
            <p>The Pixel 10 series' Voice Translate feature can translate calls in real-time. Also, it uses a technology that keeps the voice tone, so the translated voice sounds similar to the user's voice. Google said in an online press conference that this technology does not copy voices. It will not create a lasting voice model, and it will not save the voice for future use.</p>
            <p>This feature will first support English translation for Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, French, Swedish, Russian, Indonesian, Japanese, and Hindi. Japanese and Hindi will be available as a test version. Google said it will add support for more languages in the future.</p>
            <p>‚óè Magic Cue: A Smart AI Assistant That Knows What You Need</p>
            <p>The new "Magic Cue" feature is like a more "active" AI assistant. It will look for and suggest useful information from different apps based on what the user is doing at that moment. For example, if someone asks the user for their flight booking details, it can "automatically" find the correct flight number from their Gmail inbox.</p>
            <p>Google said that when people work, they often have to switch between many apps to find documents, emails, and calendar events. Magic Cue can get related information from different apps and combine it right away. This gives suggestions that are very helpful.</p>
            <p>Magic Cue works across Google's own apps and other companies' apps. Right now, it is only available in the US and some English-speaking areas.</p>
            <p>‚óè Pro Models Get 1 Year of Free Google AI Pro Service, Worth NT$7800</p>
            <p>Today, Google announced four Pixel 10 series main phones. Besides the basic Pixel 10 model, the other three Pro models come with 1 year of free Google AI Pro service. In Taiwan, this service costs NT$650 per month. So, this free trial is worth NT$7800. After the trial, users will need to pay, but they can stop the service anytime.</p>
            <p>The Google AI Pro service includes AI tools like Imagen 4 and Veo 3. Veo 3 can turn text into video. It also gives 2TB of cloud storage and increases the use limit for the writing assistant, NotebookLM.</p>
