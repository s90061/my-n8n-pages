            <h1>Driver Dies After Car Accident on National Freeway 3 in Taichung</h1>
            <p>An accident happened on National Freeway 3 in Taichung's Wuri area tonight. The police said that a man named Cai parked his broken-down car on the side lane. Another driver, Mr. You, who was going in the same direction, hit Mr. Cai's car from behind. Mr. Cai was taken to the hospital but sadly passed away. The police will investigate to find out why the accident happened.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Highway Police Team of the National Freeway Police Bureau explained that the accident happened around 7:07 PM tonight. It was on National Freeway 3, going north, at the 203.7-kilometer mark in the Wuri area of Taichung. One driver was seriously hurt and died after being taken to the hospital.</p>
            <p>The police said that Mr. Cai, who was 57 years old, had stopped his car on the side lane because it broke down. His hazard lights were flashing. Mr. You, 35 years old, was driving his car in the same lane and might not have been paying attention. He then hit Mr. Cai's car from behind.</p>
            <p>The police stated that Mr. Cai was taken to Chung Shan Medical University Hospital for urgent medical care. However, he was declared dead at 8:28 PM. After the accident, traffic was slow for about 1 kilometer. The road was cleared at 7:58 PM. The police will continue to investigate how and why the accident happened.</p>
            <p>The police are asking all drivers that if their car breaks down, they should try to move it to the shoulder of the road. They should also put a warning sign at least 50 meters behind the car (or 100 meters if the car is still in a lane). People should wait for help outside the guardrail or a safe distance in front of the car.</p>

            <h1>Jody Chiang's "No.You" Last Concert Ends, She Hopes to See Fans Again</h1>
            <p>Jody Chiang, a famous Taiwanese singer, had her last "No.You" concert tonight at the Taipei Arena. At the end of the concert, she asked the thousands of fans to sing "Jia Li Lan Lao Lao" together. She was so touched that she cried and stopped singing for a moment. When fans asked for more shows, she shouted, "I hope to see you again!"</p>
            <p>After Jody Chiang sang her first set of songs tonight, thousands of fans wished her "Happy Birthday." She was very moved. She said she doesn't usually celebrate her birthday, but she kept thanking her fans.</p>
            <p>During this concert tour, she sang many of her classic songs again, like "Silent Flower," "Moon, Listen to Me," "Happy Small Station," and "You Must Be Patient." She also invited "Ming Hsing Ke," the oldest glove puppet show group in Taiwan, to perform. She wanted the puppet show to connect with her memories of her father. She also sang "Old Musician" for her father and the musicians on stage.</p>
            <p>Jody Chiang said she still couldn't believe tonight was the last concert. When fans asked for more shows, she laughed and said, "Do you think the Taipei Arena belongs to me? All the dates are already planned. If I could add more shows, I would love to sing more. But the organizers need to arrange it. If it's possible, let's look forward to it, okay?"</p>
            <p>At the end of the concert, Jody Chiang specially asked the band and dancers to come on stage to receive applause from the audience. She invited everyone to sing "Jia Li Lan Lao Lao" together. She cried again and said, "Everyone is crying, how can I sing? Let me calm down." Then, she wiped away her tears and sang, "Let go of the past, then life has hope. Let me hold you tight." With this classic song, she ended her "No.You" concert series, which had 23 shows in Kaohsiung and Taipei. Her final shout of "I hope to see you again" seemed to hint that she might hold concerts again in the future.</p>

            <h1>Serious Mood in Beijing Before Military Parade: Some Take Photos, Others Find It Hard to Go Home</h1>
            <p>The Chinese military parade on September 3rd is coming soon. In Beijing, inside the second ring road, you can see police everywhere. Security has become much stricter, and the atmosphere is very serious. For several weekends in a row, some shops had to close for practice. Some people were busy taking photos in front of the special decorations set up by the government. But for shops and people living near the blocked areas, they had to deal with closed stores and police checks before going home.</p>
            <p>This year, China is holding events to remember the 80th anniversary of the victory in the "Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." The main event is the military parade on September 3rd. On Chang'an Avenue, which runs east to west in front of Tiananmen Square, there are already seats in gold, red, and green colors. On the other side, there are decorations shaped like the Great Wall and a big screen.</p>
            <p>These days, many people in Beijing are riding bicycles along Chang'an Avenue to feel the atmosphere of the parade. But when they ride past Tiananmen Square, staff members check their IDs one by one and look inside their bags. Around Tiananmen Square, staff also tell people not to stop and take pictures. Many people ride slowly with one hand and take photos with the other.</p>
            <p>The Forbidden City in Beijing, which is nearby, is also temporarily closed from August 31st to September 4th for the parade and other events. Normally, many people dressed in Qing Dynasty clothes take photos in the Forbidden City. But these days, because of the parade controls, there are few people at the Forbidden City. Some people have to stop outside the Forbidden City to take pictures. They want to remember the unusual sight of the Beijing Forbidden City without crowds.</p>
            <p>Yesterday was the last weekend before the military parade in Beijing. Although some roads were still closed, this weekend was different from the previous ones because there were no parade practices. The streets felt less serious. Many people rushed to the intersection near Dongdan subway station yesterday to take photos with the special flower beds. There were many people there.</p>
            <p>In the crowd, some children wore red scarves and held the five-star flag while taking pictures with the flower beds. Because there were so many people, at least 10 police officers watched the situation near one flower bed.</p>
            <p>A person named Shu said that China also had a military parade 10 years ago. In the past, when WeChat Moments and social media were not so popular, people didn't know about these places or the decorations on Chang'an Avenue. This time, they decided to come and take photos because they saw videos shared online by other people.</p>
            <p>Around 5:50 PM yesterday, many people looked disappointed because they were stopped at the crossing of Chongwenmen Inner Street and East Chang'an Avenue. This was because controls would start at 6:00 PM. One person who has worked in Beijing for over 10 years said they took a bus past Tiananmen Square and thought the decorations were beautiful. So, they got off the bus to ride a bicycle and enjoy it. But because of traffic rules, they couldn't enter the area. They could only take pictures with the flower beds from outside.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening, at bus stops like Dongdan West Crossing and Wangfujing, people were lining up. At least 50 people were at each stop. They all wanted to take a bus before 11:00 PM yesterday to see Tiananmen Square, which was specially decorated for the parade. Bus routes 1 and 52, which pass in front of Tiananmen Square, were full of people on every bus.</p>
            <p>Around 7:00 PM last night, when a bus stopped at Wangfujing station, a lot of people rushed to get on. A bus conductor leaned out from the bus to guide the crowd. They told people stuck near the bus door to get off so the door could close easily. After each bus arrived, the conductor and the people had to wait for 5 to 6 minutes before the door could close and the bus could leave.</p>
            <p>The government had already practiced the parade for three weekends before. During those times, many people with cameras stood outside the blocked areas, eager to watch. But inside the same blocked areas, some shops had to close early or even stay closed for the whole day to help with the practice. Also, people who lived there had to wait in line outside their homes. They had to show their ID to prove they lived there before they could enter the controlled area. These were some of the problems people faced.</p>
