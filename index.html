A Russian-made drone flew into Lithuania from Belarus and then crashed. This happened on July 10th. Luckily, no one was hurt and nothing was damaged.

The drone was made of light materials like foam and wood. It had wires and other parts inside. Officials are still checking what the drone was for. It could have been for smuggling, spying, or testing Lithuania's air defenses. It might also have been a target that got lost during a military exercise in Belarus.

When the drone first appeared, some thought it was a "Shahed" drone, which Russia uses in Ukraine. But later, it was confirmed to be another type of Russian drone called "Gerbera." The Lithuanian government is still looking into why it entered their airspace. After the drone crashed, the country was on high alert for a short time, and NATO planes were ready.

**Heavy Rains Hit Southern Taiwan, Roads Closed**

Heavy rain has caused big problems in southern Taiwan, especially in Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Taitung. On July 10th, many roads were closed because rivers overflowed. For example, a road to Dawu Village in Pingtung was washed away, making the village hard to reach. More than 2,000 people had to leave their homes in the mountain areas of Pingtung and Kaohsiung.

The weather agency said that from July 9th to 10th, Pingtung County had the most rain, with 794 millimeters in Majia Township. A low-pressure system is now moving north, so central Taiwan might get heavy rain today. Some areas in Pingtung and Kaohsiung have also announced that schools and offices will be closed today, July 11th.

The storms also caused power outages for about 1 million homes across Taiwan. Power company Taipower said 2,454 power poles fell, which is a new record. Many workers are trying to fix the power, especially in the Chiayi and Tainan areas. It is taking a long time because the poles are heavy and fallen trees block the roads.

**US Adds High Taxes on Brazilian Goods, Affecting Taiwanese Firms**

The United States has decided to add a 50% tax on products from Brazil. This new tax will start on August 1st. This could make products from Brazil too expensive to sell in the US, especially for companies making technology and electronics. Taiwanese companies that have invested in Brazil will also feel the effects.

A professor of economics, Robson GonÃ§alves, said that if the tax on technology and electronics is more than 25%, Brazilian companies will not be able to compete in the US market. A Taiwanese company that makes industrial computers said their prices for US customers would have to go up by 50%. They are telling customers to wait or buy from their company's European branch and then import to the US.

Other industries, like chemicals and car parts, will also suffer if the tax is over 20%. They might lose money and international contracts. In the first half of 2025, Brazil sold about 1.1 billion US dollars worth of electronic products to the US. This new tax could hurt Brazil's factories and entire supply chains.
