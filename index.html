            <h1>Over 6,000 Students Join Women's Leadership Training; Yang Yu-Hsin Shares Life Lessons</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education has run a training camp for female university students to develop their leadership skills. So far, more than 6,000 students have taken part. Today, at a special event, Yang Yu-Hsin, who is the director of the Social Affairs Department in Keelung City, talked about how she has faced a rare illness since she was 19. She encouraged young women to think about the meaning of suffering in their lives.</p>
            <p>The Youth Development Administration of the Ministry of Education started this training camp in 2003. It aims to help female students gain self-confidence, get involved in society, and make a difference. Today is both the UN's "International Day of the Girl Child" and "Taiwan Girls' Day." So, the Youth Development Administration held an event called "Becoming a Super Girl â€“ Sharing Session for Past Trainees." Many speakers were invited to share their experiences.</p>
            <p>Yang Yu-Hsin, the director of Keelung City's Social Affairs Department, found out she had a rare illness called Miyoshi distal myopathy when she was 19. Her arm and leg muscles slowly became weak, making it hard for her to move. Today, she joked that when she was 19, her health was at its best. After that, she started to feel how it was to lose her abilities and feel sad.</p>
            <p>Later, she began working with the Rare Disease Foundation. Yang Yu-Hsin saw that many people were in worse situations than her. She thought, "At least my mind is clear, and I can speak." So, she decided to speak for them and act for them. She was lucky to become a lawmaker and helped change laws and policies to give people better support.</p>
            <p>"All suffering has meaning," Yang Yu-Hsin said in her talk today. She encouraged all the students to see their difficulties in life as a blessing that helps them grow. She also asked them to think if their own struggles could help others.</p>
            <p>Shen Li-Chien, who is currently studying at Tsing Hua University, also shared her story today. She won the Presidential Education Award before. When she was born, she had leukemia. During her treatment, her right leg had to be removed. Since she was little, she had to get a new artificial leg every two years. As she grew up, she learned to call these artificial legs "beautiful legs" and saw them in a positive way.</p>
            <p>When she was in school, Shen Li-Chien sometimes faced teasing from classmates, and she felt sad. Later, her father had a chance to legally raise eagles. She joined him in training them and learned from the eagles not to be afraid of what others think. She remembered the brave qualities of birds of prey.</p>
            <p>Shen Li-Chien started to bravely wear shorts outside, showing her "beautiful legs." She said today that if she hadn't taken that step, she might have always lived hidden by long pants. In high school, she began volunteering. She shared her life story and talked about environmental issues in different schools. She hopes that people can also learn good things by looking at the world through an eagle's eyes.</p>

            <h1>Expert Says China's New Rare Earth Rules Will Affect US Defense Industry, Talks Are Needed</h1>
            <p>China has made its rules for exporting rare earths stricter. This has made the trade conflict between the US and China worse again, and a meeting between presidents Trump and Xi might not happen. An expert has said that China's actions will affect the US defense industry. This means the US will definitely need to start talks. There is still time for both sides to discuss things before the new rules start in December.</p>
            <p>On October 9, the Chinese government released six announcements in a row. US media described these new rules as "almost unheard of" controls on exports. Even foreign companies will need permission from China to export if their products contain rare earth materials from China, and these materials make up 0.1% or more of the product's total value. The rules for products made outside China will begin on December 1.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump wrote a long message on his social media platform, "Truth Social," on October 10. He said, "Some very strange things are happening in China! They have become very unfriendly." He criticized China's control over rare earth mineral exports. He also said that he was supposed to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in South Korea at the end of the month, "but now it seems there is no reason to do so."</p>
            <p>Trump also stated that because China is putting "extremely strong" controls on rare earth minerals, he will add a 100% tax on Chinese goods starting November 1.</p>
            <p>Today, the Chinese website of the BBC quoted Jonathan Czin, an expert on China and a researcher at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Czin said that Xi Jinping's recent actions are meant to give him power in the upcoming talks. Also, looking at how China reacted after the US announced new taxes in early April, Czin does not believe China is worried about the US taking revenge.</p>
            <p>China has used rare earths as a bargaining chip before. However, Gracelin Baskaran, who leads the Critical Minerals Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, said that China's newest export rules are aimed at defense manufacturers outside China. This makes the situation very serious.</p>
            <p>"Nothing will make the US act more than targeting its defense industry," she said. "The US will definitely need to start talks because we have few choices. And in a time of growing international tension and possible conflicts, we must make our defense industry stronger."</p>
            <p>Even though a meeting between Trump and Xi seems unlikely right now, Baskaran said that this does not mean that talks are completely impossible. She pointed out that China's new rules will not start until December. This gives both sides time and space to discuss, and talks might begin soon.</p>

            <h1>Hau Lung-bin Says Online "Army" Interfered in Election; Chao Shao-kang Asks China to Stop</h1>
            <p>Hau Lung-bin, who is a candidate for chairperson of the Kuomintang (KMT) party, said that a huge "online army" spread false rumors to attack him. Today, Chao Shao-kang, the former chairman of Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC), said that the KMT chairperson election is a private matter for the KMT. However, he noted that mainland China has interfered greatly. He hopes the Chinese government will stop this. If the Chinese government allows it, then it is involvement. This is now a national security issue, and Taiwan's security agencies should investigate who is behind these actions.</p>
            <p>The KMT chairperson election will be held on October 18. Hau Lung-bin said recently that running for party chairperson has been a big surprise for him. He has faced attacks from an "online army" that is even stronger than a national team. This was more than he expected. Many fake accounts from inside and outside Taiwan spread false information online to attack him. He wonders where these "online armies" come from. The attacks he received were stronger than the "1450" team of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</p>
            <p>Chao Shao-kang, who supports Hau Lung-bin and is the former chairman of BCC, and Liu Tsai-wei, a Taipei City Councilor from the KMT, held a press conference this morning. The press conference was titled "A Serious Warning to Mainland Authorities: Do Not Interfere in the KMT Chairperson Election."</p>
            <p>Chao Shao-kang said that recently, there have been many false messages attacking Hau Lung-bin online. He believes that the language used suggests these false messages came from mainland China. Of course, some are from Taiwan, but many are from the mainland, and many are made by AI. The number of false messages is very large, more than what a regular internet celebrity could do. It must involve many people and resources to spread so widely.</p>
            <p>Chao Shao-kang pointed out that the KMT chairperson election should just be a KMT internal matter. But now, mainland China has interfered a lot. He hopes the Chinese government will step in and stop it. If they don't stop it, they are allowing it. If the Chinese government allows it, then it is interference. This is now a national security issue. Taiwan's national security agencies should also investigate who is doing these things.</p>
            <p>When asked if Hau Lung-bin was talking about his opponent, Cheng Li-wen, Chao Shao-kang said that he did not mention Cheng Li-wen, and Hau Lung-bin also did not say who it was. He said that pointing out this situation does not mean accusing anyone; instead, they simply do not want to see this kind of situation.</p>
            <p>The media asked why China might be interfering in the KMT chairperson election. Chao Shao-kang suggested that mainland China might be looking for a KMT chairperson candidate they can control. Hau Lung-bin has repeatedly said that he will not "lick the communists." In the past, when Hau Lung-bin visited mainland China, he always insisted that the existence of the Republic of China should be recognized. So, for the Chinese government, Hau Lung-bin might not be a good KMT chairperson. He also announced that Hau Lung-bin will hold a discussion about mainland policy on October 14.</p>
            <p>At the press conference, they showed many web pages with false information. They also showed an AI-made video of Hau Lung-bin and Liu Tsai-wei kissing. Liu Tsai-wei said she felt disgusted and heartbroken. She said that the party chairperson election should not be like this, as it harms the party's reputation. She urged the person secretly behind these actions to stop. She also said that tomorrow, she and Chao Shao-kang will report the incident to the police and file a lawsuit to warn the person responsible that she will not let it go.</p>
