The US Justice Department announced that two Chinese men are accused of trying to steal information about COVID-19 vaccines. They believe the men were told by the Chinese government to hack into American computer systems. One man has been caught in Italy and will be sent to the US. The other man is still free. The Justice Department said they will find him and hold him responsible for hurting American cyber security and people.

The department said on July 8 that Xu Zewei was arrested in Italy on July 3. Xu and Zhang Yu are accused of hacking computers between February 2020 and June 2021. This includes a big hacking event called HAFNIUM, which affected thousands of computers worldwide. According to court papers, officials from China's Ministry of State Security in Shanghai told Xu to hack. He worked for a company called "Powerock," which is one of many companies in China that help the government with hacking.

The FBI stated that in February 2020, when the pandemic started, Xu and other hackers working for the Chinese Communist Party targeted US universities to steal important COVID-19 research. The next year, these same hackers, known as HAFNIUM, used weaknesses in US systems to steal more research. The FBI also said that HAFNIUM attacked over 60,000 American organizations to steal private information. More than 12,000 places were affected, including a university in Texas and a law firm with offices around the world.

After hacking, Xu and others put special programs on the affected computers to control them from afar. Xu and Zhang worked together under orders from the Shanghai State Security Bureau. They reported their hacking results and looked for information about specific US policymakers and government agencies, using keywords like "China source," "State Security Ministry," and "Hong Kong." The Justice Department said Xu's case also shows how China uses many private companies to hack and steal information, which helps hide the government's role. These private companies in China look for vulnerable computers to find data they can sell to the Chinese government or others. The department added that this approach leads to more victims in the US and around the world, and a lot of stolen information. Most of this stolen data is not useful to the Chinese government and is sold to other parties.

Xu is accused of crimes like wire fraud, identity theft, and illegally accessing protected computers. His lawyer said Xu does not want to be sent to the US for trial and believes the authorities have the wrong person.

**Tank hits house and cars during Han Kuang exercise in Taoyuan**

Taiwan's important yearly military exercise, "Han Kuang 41," started on July 9. Late last night, a tank crashed into a house and cars in Xinwu District, Taoyuan. This happened because the tank driver was not familiar with the road.

Police said they will handle the situation like a regular car accident. Nobody was hurt in the incident.

People posted on social media that a tank hit a house and cars next to the Mei Hua community on HSR South Road Section 6 in Xinwu District, Taoyuan. The cars that were hit looked completely destroyed. Yangmei police told the media that the tank might have driven down a small road next to houses instead of the main road, possibly due to the driver not knowing the area well.

The military has not yet commented on the incident or confirmed if it was directly related to the ongoing exercise.
