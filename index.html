            <h1>Taiwanese TV Show "Sea of Intimacy" Ends, Yu Tzu-yu Sadly Breaks Up</h1>
            <p>The last episode of the Taiwanese TV show "Sea of Intimacy" had many exciting parts about love. Actor Wu Kang-ren could not get the love he wanted. He went to a gay sauna by himself to let out his feelings. This showed his deep feelings for Lee Ming-shun that he had hidden for many years. This scene was very open and made many people talk about the show.</p>
            <p>In the show, Yu Tzu-yu loved Lee Ming-shun very much. She gave her love for 25 years without saying anything. People made fun of her, calling her an old mistress who was left alone. But in the end, she understood that "true closeness means understanding someone's heart, not how well you know them, or being physically close." Finally, she directly faced him and ended their love. She told Lee Ming-shun, "I don't love you anymore."</p>
            <p>This part of the show was very real and hard to watch. It made many people on social media feel the same way about women's feelings. Many internet users said, "It made me so sad I cried, it was like seeing my past self."</p>
            <p>Lee Ming-shun spoke through a press release about the big talks caused by the last episode. He said, "This show was a journey for me to understand love and choices again."</p>
            <p>All 7 episodes of "Sea of Intimacy" are now available on CATCHPLAY+ (in Taiwan, Indonesia, and Singapore), LINE TV, Hong Kong Now TV, and Amazon Prime Video. This lets viewers watch this exciting story about feelings and social issues as many times as they want.</p>

            <h1>High-Speed Rail Offers Half-Price Tickets for University Students Going Back to School, Buy from August 6</h1>
            <p>Taiwan High Speed Rail announced today that from September 3rd to 9th, they will offer special half-price trains for university students. Besides the usual student discount trains, they will add two extra trains going south and two extra trains going north each day. These trains will stop at all stations and are for students going back to school. You can buy tickets starting from August 6th.</p>
            <p>Many colleges and universities will start classes in September, so students will be going back to school. To help with this, besides the regular student tickets that are 50%, 75%, or 88% off, from September 3rd to 9th, there will be two extra trains going south and two extra trains going north every day. These trains will stop at all stations and offer a 50% discount for students going back to school.</p>
            <p>Taiwan High Speed Rail said there will be 28 special trains in total during this time. Travelers can buy tickets starting from 12:00 AM on August 6th, when ticket booking opens.</p>
            <p>Taiwan High Speed Rail also said that for tickets with the university student discount, you can book them online through the High Speed Rail website. You can also use the T-EX mobile app, buy them at convenience stores that work with High Speed Rail, or at ticket counters at the train stations. You can book, pay, and get your ticket all at once.</p>
            <p>In addition, Taiwan High Speed Rail said that students using the discount must bring their valid student ID card when they travel. If the student ID card does not have a clear stamp for the current school term, or if the stamp is hard to see, students must also show an official paper proving they are still students. This is for checking their identity.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rain in Changhua: Backyard of a Traditional House Collapses, House Foundation Washes Away</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain continues in the Changhua area. In Fenyuan Township, a large part of the ground behind a traditional courtyard house has collapsed. Even though a tarp was used to cover it, soil kept falling away. In Yuanlin City, the foundation of a house washed away. The fallen soil turned into a mudslide. The local government quickly used large bags of soil to build a wall to stop the disaster from getting worse.</p>
            <p>Because of strong winds from the southwest, Changhua has had many days of continuous heavy rain. This has caused some small problems like floods and mudslides in areas such as Fenyuan Township, Changhua City, Yuanlin City, and Ershui Township. For example, in Tong'an Village, Fenyuan Township, there is a traditional courtyard house in the Bagua Mountain area. The ground on the slope next to it washed away. The people living there found a hole about 10 meters deep in their backyard.</p>
            <p>The head of Tong'an Village, Lin Tzu-lung, was told about the problem. He quickly helped the family living in the traditional house to move out. At the same time, he covered the collapsed area with a tarp. However, because of the heavy rain, the collapsed area kept getting bigger. Lin Tzu-lung told reporters today that a new crack, 3 meters long, appeared next to the collapsed area yesterday. If the rain does not stop, the collapse will get much worse, and the people living there might lose their homes.</p>
            <p>Besides the collapsed ground behind the traditional house in Fenyuan Township, a house foundation in Yuanlin City also washed away yesterday. The soil that fell mixed with the rainwater and became a mudslide. Workers from the Yuanlin City office helped the residents leave. They also quickly brought large bags of soil to make a temporary wall. This was to protect houses further down the hill from being affected.</p>
