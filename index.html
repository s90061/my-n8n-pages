            <h1>Xiao S Wins Golden Bell Award, Cries and Thanks Her Sister for Good Luck; Gives Award to Her Mother.</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese celebrity Xiao S (Dee Hsu) won the Best Host for a Variety Show award at the 60th Golden Bell Awards today. She won with her co-host, Patrick Liu, for their show "Miss Buxidi." She cried happily when she won. Xiao S said she wanted to give the award to her mother. She also thanked her older sister, Barbie Hsu, who is in heaven, for helping her. Xiao S said, "You really looked out for me."</p>
            <p>Her sister, Barbie Hsu, first encouraged Xiao S to start "Miss Buxidi." After winning, Xiao S thanked Barbie Hsu, saying, "Thank you for encouraging me." She hopes the award will make her mother feel better. "My mom said she has a big empty feeling in her heart. She said if I won today, it might fill that hole a little bit."</p>
            <p>Xiao S said she wants to put the award next to a photo of Barbie Hsu. This might help her mother feel better quickly. When she thanked Patrick Liu, she joked, "You're great, that's all."</p>
            <p>Patrick Liu said that 11 years ago, when he was on a variety show, a host asked him about his dream. "11 years later, I am hosting a show with that same host, and we won a Golden Bell Award together." He thanked Xiao S, Barbie Hsu, and all the viewers.</p>
            <p>Later, Xiao S spoke to the media backstage. She said this was her second Golden Bell Award. The first time was for hosting "Kangxi Coming," but she was pregnant and not there. This was the first time she received an award on stage. She strongly felt that her sister, Barbie Hsu, helped her win. She held up a necklace and said, "She is here, always with me. She is inside this." She wears the necklace when she misses her sister.</p>
            <p>Since the list of nominees was announced, many people watched this award category closely. Xiao S said that many people told her Barbie Hsu would surely bless her. She tried to stay calm. After winning, she felt, "Sister, you really are amazing!" She joked that Barbie Hsu must have made many powerful friends in heaven.</p>
            <p>Xiao S had not appeared in public for a long time. She said she did not walk the red carpet because she wanted to focus on the awards. She wanted the audience to see a recovered Xiao S, to feel that she is doing well now. About returning to hosting, she said she does not want to push herself too hard. But she was surprisingly calm during the awards ceremony. Maybe hosting again is not as scary as she thought. She laughed and said the first thing she would do after winning is "drink alcohol."</p>

            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, when Trump met Zelenskyy at the White House today, Zelenskyy said that Russian President Putin "is not ready" for peace talks. But Trump said that Putin "wants to end this war."</p>

            <h1>Former U.S. National Security Advisor Bolton Pleads Not Guilty to Misusing Secret Information.</h1>
            <p>According to U.S. news, former National Security Advisor John Bolton said he is not guilty in court today, October 17. He was charged with "wrongly handling secret information." Bolton worked for President Donald Trump for 17 months during his first term. After that, he often spoke against Trump.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that John Bolton faces 18 criminal charges. These include sharing and keeping top-secret national defense information. He said he was not guilty in a court hearing today in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>
            <p>The report said that Bolton was released without bail after the hearing. His next court date is November 21.</p>
            <p>Bolton was charged on October 16. The official document says Bolton sent secret papers by email to two "people who were not allowed to see them." The document did not name these people, but it is thought to be his wife and daughter.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Justice said these papers "showed information about future attacks, foreign enemies, and relationships with other countries."</p>
            <p>Each charge can lead to up to 10 years in prison.</p>
            <p>Bolton said in a statement that he did not do anything wrong. He said he "has become the newest victim of the Justice Department using its power for political reasons."</p>
            <p>Bolton is now the third person who has criticized Trump to be charged in recent weeks. Before him, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James were also charged.</p>
