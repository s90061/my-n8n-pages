A typhoon recently hit southern Taiwan very hard. Some news reported damage to a solar power plant in Xingwen, Chiayi. The Energy Agency explained that the damage was inside the power plant area and did not affect people living nearby. They have asked the company to clean up within two days and make the structures stronger for the future. The agency wants everyone to look at the damage calmly.

They said that even with the strong winds from the typhoon, most solar power plants continued to work well. This shows that these systems are well-built to handle disasters. During the typhoon, solar power produced a lot of electricity, making up 15.2% of all power used. This proves that solar power can provide stable energy even in bad weather.

The Energy Agency also warned about fake pictures and stories online. They said these can cause people to misunderstand and create unnecessary fear. This also makes it harder for the government to do its job during a disaster. The agency asked everyone not to spread wrong information and said the government will continue to watch things closely to keep everyone safe and help green energy grow.

**China Southern Airlines Introduces "15-Minute Boarding" Amidst Competition**

The airline industry in China is very competitive. China Southern Airlines has started a new service called "15-Minute Boarding." This service allows passengers to get on their flight as long as they arrive at the boarding gate 15 minutes before the plane is scheduled to leave. This is different from the usual rule of closing check-in counters 30 to 40 minutes before departure.

This new service is the first of its kind in China. Many people online are calling it the "easiest boarding rule ever," with some even saying they can now catch a plane like a bus. The Chinese airline industry is still getting back on its feet, and companies like China Southern Airlines are trying to attract more customers. This new service aims to make flying easier and quicker for passengers, especially business travelers, and help the airline compete with high-speed trains.

However, if you have luggage to check, you still need to do that 30 minutes before your flight. This new service started on flights between Guangzhou and Beijing, and China Southern Airlines plans to offer it on more routes from Guangzhou in the future.

**Cellular Biotech Teams Up for AI Drug Development and Cancer Treatment**

Cellular Biotech has announced that it is working with Taipei Medical University to create a special platform for developing new drugs using Artificial Intelligence (AI). They will focus on making new small molecule drugs. Cellular Biotech is also partnering with Gene Discovery (G-Mi), a company that studies genes, to help drug companies create new treatments for cancer. Their goal is to develop personalized cancer treatments.

Mr. Tsai Cheng-hsien, the chairman of Cellular Biotech, said his company has been using AI for 15 years. They use AI to improve both their research and how they manage their business. He hopes this will lead to new discoveries in medical, semiconductor, and technology fields.

Taipei Medical University and a new company called Cheng Yu Biotech, with help from Cellular Biotech, have already created 20 new small molecule drugs. Cheng Yu Biotech, which is less than a year old, has already secured a project from a Japanese drug company. This makes them the first Taiwanese company to enter the Japanese market with AI-based drug design services. Cellular Biotech and Cheng Yu Biotech plan to keep working together to find new ways to use AI in drug development.

In addition, Cellular Biotech and G-Mi are combining their strengths. G-Mi has advanced technology for sequencing genes, and Cellular Biotech has experience in AI simulation. Together, they hope to quickly develop new drugs that target specific cancer cells.
