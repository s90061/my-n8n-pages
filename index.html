<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy," hostility, and provocation. This accusation followed a speech in which he stated that Taiwan is "of course" a country, supported by historical evidence and legal proof.

Beijing asserts that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times. It claims the island is one of its provinces and has no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have repeatedly offered to hold talks with China, but these offers have been rejected. China considers Lai a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had deliberately distorted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and maintained that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that openly encouraged conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and a mix of 'Taiwan independence' errors and false beliefs," the office said in a statement.

It added, "The misleading statements made by Lai Ching-te, which go against history, reality, and legal principles, will simply be discarded by history."

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles China policy, stated that Lai was simply presenting historical facts. It called Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country "just a made-up lie without any basis."

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to acknowledge the objective existence of the Republic of China and the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, where 'the two sides are not under each other's control'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan after losing a civil war against Mao Zedong's communists. The Republic of China remains the island's official name.

Lai has repeatedly stated that only the people of Taiwan can decide their future. He also emphasized that since the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak for it.

Over the past five years, Taiwan has experienced increasing military and political pressure from China, including military exercises.

**Taiwan's new AI supercomputer Nano5, Compal, ASE and other Taiwanese manufacturers adopt its computing power**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%96%B0ai%E8%B6%85%E7%B4%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%85%A6nano5-%E4%BB%81%E5%AF%B6%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%88%E5%85%89%E7%AD%89%E5%8F%B0%E5%BB%A0%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E7%AE%97%E5%8A%9B-073107510.html">News Link</a>

(Central News Agency, Taipei, June 24) The National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) held a press conference today to demonstrate how its new national AI supercomputer, Nano 5, is driving innovation and improvements in the semiconductor industry. Companies and academic institutions such as Compal Electronics, ASE Technology Holding, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, and National Cheng Kung University also attended and shared their experiences.

It is understood that Nano 5, Taiwan's new generation AI supercomputer, is scheduled to launch on June 25th. It features NVIDIA H100 GPUs, providing strong AI computing capabilities to various industries.

The NCHC stated that Nano 5 will combine Taiwan's strengths in semiconductors to create a complete AI ecosystem, forming an "AI Team Taiwan."

Nano 5 has a computing power of 4.15 Petaflops. Companies like Synopsys have already benefited from using Nano 5 to make their semiconductor design processes better. Additionally, 15 AI startups are also using Nano 5 to speed up their AI model development and implementation. The NCHC aims to provide full support for Taiwan's AI development, from advanced research to industrial applications.

**Nvidia Secures Entire Wistron Plant Through 2026 to Build AI Servers**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) has reportedly reserved all production capacity at Wistron's newly opened server facility in Taiwan until 2026. This move is to meet the increasing demand for AI servers, as reported by Economic Daily.

Nvidia has reportedly secured all server manufacturing capacity at Wistron's recently launched plant in Zhubei, Taiwan. This is for the production of its next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. These orders, which extend through 2026, show Nvidia's strong effort to guarantee essential AI infrastructure capacity, as demand continues to be higher than supply.

The plant began operations this quarter and was officially opened on June 19. Wistron's CEO confirmed at the event that contracts for AI server production are already in place for at least a year. Economic Daily and Commercial Times reported that Nvidia has effectively secured all future output from the plant.

Wistron's combined operations are estimated to produce 240,000 Blackwell-based systems per quarter. The company has warned that its current capacity might not meet future demand by 2026. To address this, Wistron has acquired an adjacent building to serve as a second AI server site next year, aiming to double its production in Taiwan.

AI server shipments have become a main driver of growth not only for Wistron but also for Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is simultaneously expanding its presence in the U.S. with a new facility near Dallas, Texas.

By reserving full production at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia is ensuring that its cloud and system partners receive the necessary quantities of AI servers, while competitors face tighter supply limitations. Nvidia's control over the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity indicates its strategic goal to dominate the AI hardware ecosystem.
