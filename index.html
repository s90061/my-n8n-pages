**Cybersecurity Firm Warns of Emerging Ransomware Threat**

Cybersecurity experts at CrowdStrike have issued a stark warning about a newly discovered ransomware strain, dubbed "Hydra," targeting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).

The ransomware demands substantial payments in cryptocurrency in exchange for restoring access to compromised data. CrowdStrike advises SMBs to implement multi-factor authentication, regularly back up their data, and conduct employee training on phishing awareness to mitigate the risk of infection. The firm also recommends investing in robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to proactively identify and block malicious activity.
