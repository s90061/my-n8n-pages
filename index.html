        const text = `**Russia Says It Controls All of Luhansk Region**

A Russian-supported official in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk region said on July 1st that Russian forces now fully control the area. This happened more than three years after Russia started its full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Luhansk is about 26,700 square kilometers. It is the first region in Ukraine that Russia has completely taken over since 2014, when Russia took Crimea. In September 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Luhansk, along with parts of Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions, would become part of Russia. Most Western countries and the world do not agree with this.

Leonid Pasechnik, who was made the head of the "Lugansk People's Republic" by Moscow, stated that the area is "100% liberated." However, Russia's Ministry of Defense has not confirmed this, and Ukraine has not commented yet. Ukraine says Russia's claims over these regions are wrong and illegal, and Kyiv will never accept them.

**Road Department Celebrates Staff; Engineer Solves Landslide Problem**

The Directorate General of Highways celebrated its 60th anniversary and honored 16 hardworking employees. One of them, Cai Weiyong, a section chief, was praised for fixing a big problem on Taiwan's Provincial Highway 18, which goes to Alishan. He has worked on this for 26 years.

The problem area, called "Wuwanzai," often had landslides when there were typhoons or heavy rain because the ground was not stable. Cai Weiyong found a way to stop this. He built 8 large wells to collect water deep underground and drain it away. Before, the ground would slide about 20 centimeters each year. Now, it only slides about 2 millimeters. Last year, even with a lot of rain from Typhoon Kaimi, the road stayed safe.

The Minister of Transportation, Chen Shih-kai, said that big projects like roads are finished by many people working together with strong effort and skill. The head of the Directorate General of Highways, Chen Wen-jui, said that Taiwan's provincial roads have grown a lot and are very important for people's daily lives and businesses. They plan to make roads even smarter and more sustainable in the future.

**Tall Dust Devil Seen in Beinan Riverbed**

On the morning of July 1st, people in Taitung saw a dust devil, many meters tall, on the dry Beinan Riverbed. It spun sand and small stones high into the air. People who saw it said it was amazing.

Pan Yongjin and Xie Xinyi, two people who saw it, quickly took videos with their phones. They said it formed suddenly and lasted about 10 minutes before disappearing. The weather was clear and sunny at the time.

A weather expert, Ran Liqun, said that this was a dust devil. These usually happen when the weather is clear and the sun is strong. The air close to the ground gets very hot and rises quickly, creating a spinning wind. If the ground is flat and has loose sand or dust, it is easier for the dust to be pulled up, making the dust devil clear to see. Strong winds, however, can stop them from forming.
