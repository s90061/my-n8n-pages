            <h1>Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng Says US Should Stop Spreading Idea That Taiwan's Status is Not Decided</h1>
            <p>On September 28, Chinese Ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, spoke at a dinner in Washington. The dinner was to celebrate the 76th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. Xie Feng said that this year is the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's return to China. He stated that "Taiwan coming back to China" is an important result of World War II and the world order after the war. He also said that the US should "respect the facts" and stop saying that "Taiwan's status is not yet decided."</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in the US shared this message on its website today. It said that Xie Feng made these comments at the dinner in Washington for Chinese people and students living in the US. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that US President Donald Trump is interested in an economic deal with China. Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to use this chance to ask Trump to officially say that the US is against Taiwan's independence.</p>
            <p>According to the embassy's message, Xie Feng said that US-China relations have "faced some challenges" this year. He noted that leaders from both countries have guided the relationship, and now it is "generally stable." He added that the US and China have many shared interests and chances to work together. They can help each other succeed, grow together, and bring good to both countries and the world.</p>
            <p>Xie Feng also said that because the US and China are two big countries, it is normal for them to have disagreements. The most important thing, he said, is to "respect each other's main interests and important concerns, and respect each other's choices for their social systems and how they grow."</p>
            <p>He then stated that Taiwan is "a part of China that cannot be separated." He repeated that this year is the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's return to China. He called "Taiwan coming back to China" an important part of the results of World War II and the world order after the war. He strongly said that the US "should respect the facts and stop spreading the wrong idea that 'Taiwan's status is not decided.'"</p>
            <p>Xie Feng also said that trade and economic ties between the US and China should help both sides. He said that nobody wins a tariff war or a trade war. He believes that treating each other equally, with respect, and helping each other is the best way to solve problems. He hopes the US will work with China and really follow the important agreements made by both leaders. He wants them to practice three main ideas: "mutual respect, peaceful existence, and working together for shared success." This will help them agree more, understand each other better, and work together more. This way, the relationship between the US and China can keep moving forward "in the right direction."</p>

            <h1>Canadian Chinese School Holds Tea Party for Teachers; Taiwanese-Canadian Politician Shares Challenges and Joys of Learning Chinese</h1>
            <p>On September 28, Confucius's birthday, the Chinese Schools Association of Western Canada held a tea party to honor teachers. They thanked Chinese teachers from different schools for their hard work and dedication to Chinese education overseas. Wade Chang, a politician of Taiwanese descent, remembered how difficult it was to learn Chinese when he was young. He said that thanks to his parents and teachers who kept pushing him, his Chinese skills improved a lot. This opened up many more chances for him in his work life.</p>
            <p>Wade Chang was at the tea party today with about 100 teachers. He looked a bit shy and said, "I'm a little nervous because when I was a child, I was most afraid of teachers. And my Chinese teacher was very strict."</p>
            <p>Wade Chang moved to Canada with his parents when he was in the 6th grade of elementary school. He told Central News Agency, "I thought school in Canada would be easy. But I also had to go to Chinese school on weekends, besides my regular elementary school."</p>
            <p>He remembered the difficult learning tasks his teachers gave him, like writing essays, memorizing Tang poems, and reading from the Analects of Confucius. He said, "It was really hard. Sometimes I had to stay up late to finish my Chinese homework."</p>
            <p>Because his parents and teachers kept pushing him, Wade Chang's Chinese skills continued to get better. This helped his career a lot. He said, "I have worked as a lawyer in Canada, Australia, and Taiwan. Being able to speak both Chinese and English allowed me to have more clients. Now that I am a member of Parliament, I can also serve my voters better using Chinese."</p>
            <p>Mei Yu-Han moved to Canada with her parents when she was two. Her parents "made her" go to Chinese school when she was young. Now, she is a Chinese teacher herself. She said, "I use my own experiences to encourage students to learn Chinese. For example, when I was in 8th grade, I went to Spain with a school trip. One day, a group of us went into a restaurant where only Spanish was spoken. We didn't know how to order food. But then, we found a waiter who understood Chinese. I talked to her in Chinese, and everyone was able to enjoy a great meal."</p>
            <p>At the tea party, awards were given to excellent teachers who had taught for 10, 20, and 30 years. Liu Li-Xin, the Director-General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Vancouver, was very moved. She said that teaching Chinese overseas is very challenging. Things like students' attitudes towards learning and cultural differences can make teaching Chinese difficult. However, many teachers still work very hard, improve themselves, and use technology to make their teaching better.</p>
            <p>She told the Central News Agency, "A good teacher can really change a student's life. My geography teacher at Taipei First Girls' High School put art and music into her lessons. This made the names of places on maps feel more real. It started my dream to explore the world and inspired me to become a diplomat."</p>
            <p>Guo Shu-Chen, the head of the Overseas Community Affairs Council at the Vancouver Office, thanked the teachers at Chinese schools for their effort in promoting traditional Chinese characters. This helps more students learn about traditional Taiwanese culture. She said, "Only traditional Chinese characters can show the beauty and rich meaning of Chinese writing. Even though they seem to have many strokes, their structure is actually easier to understand and learn."</p>
            <p>Some teachers from Hong Kong and China also told the Central News Agency that they chose to join the Chinese school system because they admire the beauty of traditional Chinese characters and the richness of Taiwanese culture. Teacher Deng Mu-Ling from Guangzhou said, "I grew up learning simplified Chinese characters, but I really like traditional characters. Language is a part of culture, and I hope more people can learn about the beauty of traditional Chinese characters."</p>

            <h1>TPBL Taipei Taishin Mars Team Gets Stronger, Raymonn Aims for Player of the Year Award</h1>
            <p>Today, September 29, the TPBL Taipei Taishin Mars team held a press conference for the new season. Head coach Xu Hao-cheng shared that their goal is still to reach the championship finals. Raymonn, a popular player who was named Rookie of the Year last season, proudly announced that he wants to become the league's Player of the Year.</p>
            <p>The 2025-26 season of the Taiwan Professional Basketball League (TPBL) will be the third season for the Mars team. Last season, the Mars made it past the playoff challenge round. However, they lost badly in the first round of the playoffs, being swept 4-0 by the New Taipei Kings.</p>
            <p>Xu Hao-cheng spoke to the media today and said that all four foreign players for the new season are new. He explained that when they looked for foreign players, the most important thing was "team spirit," which is part of the team's culture. All the foreign players arrived in mid-September, and now they are working hard to build good teamwork.</p>
            <p>Zach Lofton, an American guard, is expected to be a strong scorer. He is 193 centimeters tall. Last season, in the Lebanese basketball league, he averaged 26.4 points and 7 assists per game, with a 38% three-point shooting rate. He also had an amazing game where he scored 51 points. He won seven awards, including the league's Player of the Year.</p>
            <p>Xu Hao-cheng also said that the team's overall strength has improved for the new season. There are two players competing for each position. He added, "The team has also hired a skills coach, Edison Jones. He will help each player's individual training become more complete."</p>
            <p>Samuel Manu, known as Raymonn, was named Rookie of the Year in the 2024-25 season. After summer training, he has more ideas for the new season. He has made "Player of the Year (MVP)" one of his goals.</p>
            <p>Raymonn said, "This summer, I improved my shooting skills. I also changed my shooting form a little bit. I feel like I've gotten better in all areas. Of course, the most important improvements are my shooting and scoring consistency."</p>
            <p>Raymonn confidently stated that he hopes to be the best player in the league this year. He wants to play even better on the court and help the team win more games.</p>
