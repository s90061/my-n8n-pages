            <h1>Russian Airlines Attacked by Pro-Ukraine Hackers, Over 40 Flights Cancelled</h1>
            <p>(Moscow, July 28, Central News Agency) Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, was attacked by hackers today. A group of hackers who support Ukraine said they did it. Because of this, Aeroflot had to cancel more than 40 flights, mostly domestic ones. The Kremlin said the situation is worrying.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Aeroflot cancelled these flights after saying their computer systems had problems. The cancelled flights also included flights to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Also, at least 10 other flights were delayed.</p>
            <p>Aeroflot did not say how long it would take to fix the problem. But at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, Russia's capital, the departure boards showed many red "cancelled" signs. This happened during a time when many Russians are traveling for their holidays.</p>
            <p>A hacker group called "Silent Crow" said in a statement that they worked with a Belarusian group called Cyberpartisans BY for this attack. They said the attack was related to Russia's big war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!" Reuters has not been able to check if the statement is true, and Ukraine has not said anything about it yet.</p>
            <p>Silent Crow has said before that they were responsible for several hacker attacks this year. Their targets included Russia's property database, the national telecom company, large insurance companies, Moscow's city IT department, and the Russian office of the Korean car company KIA.</p>
            <p>Russian prosecutors confirmed that today's problems were caused by a hacker attack. They have started a criminal investigation.</p>
            <p>Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, said, "The information we are seeing in public is quite worrying. The threat from hackers is still a danger for all large companies that provide services to people."</p>
