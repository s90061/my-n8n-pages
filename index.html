httpswww.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nv121m51wo

A recent study in the UK suggests that children who use their phones more often tend to have lower well-being. The research, which looked at data from thousands of young people, found a clear link between increased screen time and less happiness or satisfaction with life. This effect was especially noticeable among girls. Experts say that while phones can be useful, too much use might negatively affect young people's mental health. They are calling for more research to understand this complex relationship better and to help parents and educators guide children on healthy phone habits.

The analysis highlights the need for workers to learn new skills and for governments to help people adapt to these changes in the job market.

The popular Italian city of Venice has started testing a new system to manage its large number of tourists. Day-trippers visiting the city now have to pay a 5-euro entry fee during peak times. This trial aims to reduce overcrowding and protect the city's delicate environment and historical sites. Visitors are required to book their entry in advance online and will receive a QR code as proof of payment. This move makes Venice one of the first major tourist destinations to introduce such a fee, as many cities struggle with the challenges of overtourism.`;
