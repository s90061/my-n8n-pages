U.S. President Donald Trump announced on July 14 that the U.S. will provide NATO with "the most advanced weapons." He also threatened "very severe" tariffs on Russia if they do not reach a peace agreement with Ukraine within 50 days. Speaking at the White House with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump stated that these weapons would be sent where they are most needed. He expressed strong displeasure with Russia's actions in the Ukraine war, warning of "secondary tariffs" that would be 100% if no deal is reached in 50 days.

**Eric Chu Criticizes DPP's Double Standards, DPP Regrets KMT-TPP's Political Tactics**

Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu criticized the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on July 14, accusing them of having double standards regarding distributing excess tax revenue to the public. He pointed out that the DPP previously distributed money when the government collected too much tax, but now opposes a recent legislative bill to give NT$10,000 to each person, claiming it would leave debt for future generations. The DPP's Taoyuan City chapter responded, stating that while the use of excess tax revenue can be discussed, they regret the KMT and Taiwan People's Party's "malicious political maneuvering" using their majority in parliament.

**Ukraine's President Zelensky Begins Government Reform, New Prime Minister Proposed**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on July 14 his plan to change the country's Prime Minister and start a new round of government reforms. He has nominated Yuliia Svyrydenko, currently the First Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister, to take over from Denys Shmyhal, who has been Prime Minister since 2020. Zelensky stated that these changes aim to make the government more effective, boost the economy, increase support for citizens, and speed up local weapon production. Svyrydenko, 39, has a master's degree in risk management and has held various public positions since 2015. The nomination needs approval from the Ukrainian parliament, where Zelensky's party has the most seats, so it is expected to pass.
