            <h1>Nebuun Choir Wins Gold in Japan Choir Contest, Shows Excitement with Chest-Framing Hand Gesture</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, July 28, CNA reporter Dai Ya-zhen) A Taiwanese choir went to Japan for the Tokyo International Choir Competition. China complained and asked for the Taiwanese flag to be removed. The name of the group was also changed from "Taiwan" to "Chinese Taipei." However, the Nebuun Choir from Kaohsiung won a gold medal in the Folk Song category on July 27 with a high score. When the choir members heard the news at a dinner, they became very excited. They kept making a hand gesture of drawing a frame on their chests. "There were no words, but everyone understood," they said.</p>
            <p>The organizers received the complaint on July 26. They quickly told the Taiwanese groups that they had to take down the Taiwanese flag hanging in the Dai-ichi Seimei Hall. Also, their name on stage had to change from "Taiwan" to "Chinese Taipei."</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office in Japan, the choir, and legislator Chiu Yi-ying, who came with them, talked a lot with the organizers. But the organizers decided to change the team's name to "Chinese Taipei" and not hang any flags of the participating countries. However, the problem with the flag did not stop them from doing their best. The Nebuun Choir still won the gold medal in the Folk Song group with a very good score.</p>
            <p>When the Nebuun Choir members got the news at the dinner, everyone became very happy. They jumped up and high-fived each other. They shouted "Taiwan number one" and made the chest-framing hand gesture.</p>
            <p>The Nebuun Choir also wrote on their Facebook page to thank their fans. They said, "This trip to Japan was not easy. During the competition, a sudden challenge surprised us, but we decided not to give up or bow down." They added, "This gold medal is not just for us. It is for all of you who believe that 'culture is worth singing about'."</p>
            <p>Their Facebook page also showed the certificate with "Taiwan" written on it. It is known that the organizers made two kinds of certificates, one with "Chinese Taipei" and one with "Taiwan." Both were given to the Nebuun Choir.</p>
            <p>On the evening of July 27, the Nebuun Choir was invited to a friendly gathering between Taiwan and Japan. This event was organized by the Kaohsiung Medical University Japanese Alumni Association. The choir also performed there. Taiwan's representative in Japan, Lee Yi-yang, legislator Chiu Yi-ying, and CNA chairman Lee Yung-te, and others were there.</p>
            <p>Lee Yi-yang told CNA that China used politics in a bad and rude way to spoil music, which made him very angry. He said that besides complaining to the organizers, they strongly criticized China for bringing politics into music.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that China's pressure is actually useless because "Taiwan is Taiwan, and China is China." This is a fact that cannot change. Taiwan is liked and respected by all democratic countries in the world because of its high technology, democracy, and freedom. Its cultural and artistic performances are also noticed globally, especially in international choir competitions where Taiwan has won many world championship titles.</p>
            <p>Lee Yi-yang said, "Taiwan uses our voices and our feelings to reach all parts of the world. We make Taiwan heard by the whole world, seen by the whole world, and loved by the whole world. We will continue to work hard like this in the future and will not be stopped by China's pressure. We will surely show our strength and let Taiwan go to the world, letting Taiwan be recognized by the world."</p>
            <p>Overseas Community Affairs Council member Hsiao Li-li, who is an alumna of Kaohsiung Medical University and knows Nebuun Choir conductor Chen Chun-chih, said she was very happy. She said the Kaohsiung Medical University Japanese Alumni Association could find many Japanese friends and university alumni to listen to the beautiful music that is usually hard to hear. This happened because the Nebuun Choir came to Japan for the competition.</p>
            <p>She said she has known Chen Chun-chih for more than ten years. When a typhoon caused damage in Liugui, he suddenly contacted her one day and said, "Sister, I am going to Liugui to take care of children." Then, he not only moved his clinic from Kaohsiung to Liugui but also used the second floor of his clinic for students to practice choir. He also asked Kaohsiung Medical University students and alumni to help with their studies. This helped these children use their singing talent. He also took them to many competitions. Some even came back to practice singing with Chen Chun-chih after finishing high school. This is how they achieved what they have today. (Editor: Liu Shu-chin) 1140728</p>
