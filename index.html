            <h1>Seven areas, including Taipei and New Taipei, have high temperature warnings. Weather expert Wu Der-rong says it will be sunny and hot until the Mid-Autumn Festival.</h1>
            <p>The weather agency today warned about high temperatures in seven cities and counties, including Greater Taipei. Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that it will be sunny and hot everywhere from today until the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the second half of this week, a tropical disturbance is expected to move through the Philippines. After that, another tropical disturbance will form east of Taiwan. We need to watch this closely.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration today released information about high temperatures. The weather in many places will be hot. New Taipei City, Taichung City, and Tainan City have an orange warning. This means there is a chance of temperatures reaching 36 degrees Celsius for several days. Taipei City, Changhua County, Yunlin County, and Pingtung County have a yellow warning. This means people should be careful of temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his weather column today that the latest European weather model shows a Pacific high-pressure system will cause sunny and hot weather everywhere from today until October 6th (Mid-Autumn Festival). In northern Taiwan, the highest temperatures will often be 37 or 38 degrees Celsius. Around noon, the UV index will often be very high or dangerous. People should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. There is also a small chance of short rains in some mountain areas in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also said that on October 4th and 5th, there will be more moisture from the south. This means there is a chance of some rain in Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that the latest weather maps from the US and Europe show another tropical disturbance forming in the sea east of the Philippines from the second half of the week. Its path is expected to go northwest, through the Philippines, and into the South China Sea. By the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival (October 6th, 8 PM), it will have mostly passed north of Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula. Another tropical disturbance will develop east of Taiwan, but its path is very uncertain. We should keep watching it.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the latest "path forecast map" from the weather agency shows that Tropical Storm Bolaven is still affecting northern Vietnam today. It will become a tropical depression tomorrow. Typhoon Saola is far from Taiwan and will change into a temperate cyclone.</p>

            <h1>UK government plans stricter rules for immigrants seeking permanent residency.</h1>
            <p>British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in a speech that the government is thinking about making it harder for immigrants to get permanent residency. One new rule might be that applicants must show they are valuable to British society.</p>
            <p>This plan is the Labour government's newest immigration policy. It comes because the "Reform UK" party, a populist group, is becoming more popular. Reform UK has been talking a lot about immigration lately. This has made the Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, take a stronger stance on the issue.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that right now, most immigrants can apply for "indefinite leave to remain" after living in the UK for five years. If they get this, they can live in the UK permanently.</p>
            <p>Today, Ms. Mahmood will speak at the Labour Party conference for the first time as Home Secretary. According to a summary of her speech from the Labour Party, the government is looking at changing the rules. Applicants will need to show they have paid social insurance, have no criminal record, and have not received welfare benefits to qualify for permanent residency.</p>
            <p>Ms. Mahmood said they are thinking about only allowing people with good English skills and a history of community volunteer work.</p>
            <p>She announced that the public will be asked for their opinions on these plans later this year.</p>
            <p>The Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, is against immigration. They have become more popular in recent surveys. Last week, they said they might suggest ending the current "indefinite leave to remain" policy. Instead, they would use five-year work visas that can be renewed.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Keir Starmer said that Reform UK wants to bring in a policy to remove many immigrants, which he called "racist." He said this would "tear the country apart."</p>
            <p>Immigration has been one of the most important issues for British voters for a long time. Controlling the number of immigrants was a key reason for the Brexit vote in 2016. However, after the UK officially left the European Union, the number of new immigrants reaching the UK was the highest it has ever been.</p>

            <h1>Oregon state sues to stop Trump from sending troops to Portland.</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, US President Trump ordered American troops to go to Portland, Oregon. Today, Oregon officials filed a lawsuit to stop this action.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, this decision to send troops is similar to what the Republican president did before. He sent troops even when Democratic leaders in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. did not want them.</p>
            <p>Trump said that sending these troops is necessary to stop crime and to stop protests against his controversial plan to deport many immigrants.</p>
            <p>Today, Oregon and Portland officials filed a lawsuit. They said Trump is going too far. They said this action "makes it normal to use the military for regular law enforcement inside the country," especially in areas led by his political opponents.</p>
            <p>Since returning to power in January this year, Trump has kept his promise from his election campaign. He has started to crack down on immigrants without legal documents. However, lawyers and non-government groups say this has often led to human rights being violated.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Trump also promised to fight what he calls violent acts by a network of "left-wing domestic terrorists." But critics believe these actions are meant to stop people from disagreeing with him.</p>
            <p>In their lawsuit, Oregon officials said there is no need to send the National Guard to Portland. They said that, contrary to what Trump says, the protests against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the area are small and peaceful.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit stated that these protests usually have fewer than 30 people. Also, there have been no situations that needed arrests since mid-June.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit added: "But (Trump's) overly strong military deployment could make tensions worse and cause new trouble."</p>
