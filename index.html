            <h1>Trump: US Sunk 3 Ships Near Venezuela</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump said that the United States has "sunk" a total of three ships near Venezuela. The day before, he confirmed that the US carried out a second deadly attack on people suspected of drug trafficking in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Trump told reporters as he left the White House to visit the UK: "We actually sank three ships, not two. You only saw two."</p>
            <p>Trump did not give more details about the third ship or say if more people died.</p>
            <p>On September 15, Trump said that US forces hit a second ship in international waters. Three people died in that attack. Trump called them "drug lord terrorists."</p>
            <p>Early this month, the US military attacked suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea, and 11 people died. After these attacks, people have often questioned if the Trump government's actions were legal.</p>
            <p>The US government showed videos of the two previous known attacks. They said they had strong proof that all the people killed were smugglers trying to bring dangerous drugs into the United States.</p>
            <p>However, the US did not give specific details to support these claims.</p>
            <p>These actions by the US military have made the situation more tense in the Caribbean area. The US has sent many navy ships to this area. This has made some people think that Washington might want to remove the government in Venezuela.</p>
