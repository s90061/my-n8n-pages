            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang: We Won't Give Up Until Ko Wen-je Is Released, After Street Clashes With Police</h1>
            <p>Today, Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), asked people to join a march for justice. From early in the morning, the group stood against the police. Many TPP members and officials went over the fences, and there were pushes and shoves with police officers many times. The event lasted for six hours and then ended. But Huang Kuo-chang said that if Ko Wen-je is not set free, they will not stop protesting.</p>
            <p>Former TPP Chairman Ko Wen-je has been held for almost one year. Today, at 7:30 AM, TPP Chairman Huang Kuo-chang started the march to ask for fair justice. However, the police closed the road to the President's residence early in the morning. They said the group was breaking the law about public gatherings. But the people did not leave. They shouted things like "Give us our road rights!", "Get rid of the bad public assembly law!", and "Ko Wen-je is innocent!". Both sides faced each other many times.</p>
            <p>Around 11:00 AM, the first pushing started between the two sides. Huang Kuo-chang, other TPP officials, party staff, and the people tried to push down the fences. A lot of police officers stood on the other side of the fences, forming a human wall to stop them. Then, the crowd broke through the first layer of fences. Many TPP officials climbed over the fences and moved over the police's human wall, like "body surfing." There were conflicts between both sides several times.</p>
            <p>After 1:00 PM, someone from the Presidential Office came to the place. They received the protest statement from the TPP. After Huang Kuo-chang gave the statement to the Presidential Office representative, Chen Pei-chi stepped forward to share her demands, asking for a fair trial.</p>
            <p>The "justice march" ended after about six hours. Huang Kuo-chang said that the TPP will keep protesting. He said they will not stop until the government releases Ko Wen-je. This event lasted six hours, and he warned that "next time, it might be 12 hours."</p>

            <h1>US Senate Armed Services Committee Shows Support for Taiwan; Taiwan Proposes Joint Military Production</h1>
            <p>Today, the two-day visit to Taiwan by Roger Wicker, the head of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, ended. People involved in foreign affairs said that the visiting group was happy with how Taiwan is working on its safety and how much progress it has made. Taiwan, on the other hand, showed worry about delays in buying military equipment. Taiwan said it is important for them to make military equipment together with other countries.</p>
            <p>Roger Wicker, the head of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, and Deb Fischer, another US Senator, arrived in Taiwan on August 29. They left Taiwan today at 3:40 PM on a US Air Force plane. This was the first time Wicker led a group to visit Taiwan since he became the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was also the first time in nine years that a head of the US Senate Armed Services Committee visited Taiwan.</p>
            <p>People involved in foreign affairs told the Central News Agency this afternoon that the visiting group reacted well to the messages from Taiwan. The group wanted to tell Taiwan that "the United States strongly supports Taiwan and sees Taiwan's efforts in safety and defense." They were happy with Taiwan's actions and progress. This makes the US want to continue supporting Taiwan's efforts in defense.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, when President Lai Ching-te met the visiting group, he said that Taiwan's defense budget for next year will be more than 3% of its GDP. He also said that by 2030, the defense budget will be 5% of its GDP, like what NATO countries do. People involved in foreign affairs said that Wicker and Fischer reacted very positively to this.</p>
            <p>Regarding the delays in buying military equipment, people involved in foreign affairs said that Taiwan showed its concern about this, and the visiting group understood. Taiwan also said that making military equipment together with others is very important. Wicker also mentioned that the US Senate Armed Services Committee will start talking about the "2025 National Defense Authorization Act" next Tuesday. This act will include many laws that support Taiwan. This was also one of the messages Wicker wanted to share.</p>
            <p>When asked about opposition parties trying to limit the defense budget, people involved in foreign affairs said that the visiting group met with different groups through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). They believe the group had good talks and understood that most people in Taiwan agree that the defense budget needs to be increased enough.</p>
