            <h1>Trump: No Meeting with Xi Jinping Without a Trade Deal</h1>
            <p>People are wondering when US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet. Today, President Trump said that if the US and China make a trade deal, he will probably meet Xi Jinping by the end of the year. But if they don't make a deal, he will not meet him. Trump also said that both sides are very close to reaching an agreement.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump talked on the phone with CNBC, a business news channel. When asked about meeting Xi, Trump said that Xi Jinping asked to meet him. If the US and China agree, he will likely meet Xi Jinping by the end of this year. "If we don't have a deal, there will be no meeting," he said.</p>
            <p>He asked, "What's the point of meeting if we can't make a deal?" But he also stressed that the US and China are very close to an agreement now. "We are getting along well with China," he added.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he thinks the US and China can reach a deal. Before this, US and Chinese officials met in Sweden at the end of July. This was their third round of trade talks. They want to fix economic problems and extend the agreement to pause tariffs, which was made in mid-May.</p>
            <p>In May, the US and China met in Geneva and made an agreement. Both countries greatly lowered their high taxes on goods for 90 days. This break in the trade war will end on August 12.</p>
            <p>The US and China had already made early agreements in May and June. They wanted to stop the tariff payback and the stopping of rare earth mineral exports from China. Now, with the August 12 deadline coming soon, China needs to make a lasting agreement about tariffs with the US.</p>

            <h1>Intel's New Processor Might Lose Money Due to Low Production Quality</h1>
            <p>Reuters has reported, using information from people who know about it, that Intel is having big problems. Intel wants to make its new powerful laptop chip, called Panther Lake, using its 18A process. But this summer, only 10% of these chips are good enough. This means Intel might not make much money, or even lose money, on these chips.</p>
            <p>The report says that Intel used to only design and make its own chips. It also used TSMC to make some chips for them. Now, Intel wants to grow its business and become a company that makes chips for others, like TSMC. But first, Intel needs to become as good as TSMC in making chips.</p>
            <p>Last year, early tests of the 18A process did not meet what customers hoped for. But later, Intel said that the 18A process was going well and that they could start making many Panther Lake chips this year.</p>
            <p>Panther Lake chips have new, better parts called transistors and use power more smartly. Intel hoped that by making these advanced chips with the 18A process, other companies would want Intel to make chips for them too.</p>
            <p>However, two people who saw Intel's test production numbers since late last year said that only a small number of Panther Lake chips made recently were good enough for customers. This low "yield" means Intel might find it hard to make a profit from these chips soon.</p>
            <p>In April this year, Intel said it had started an important step called "risk production" for making Panther Lake chips with the 18A process. In May, Intel also showed some laptops with Panther Lake chips at the Computex show in Taipei. But the problems are still there.</p>
            <p>The report explains that chip makers check how many good chips they make by looking at how many mistakes are on each part of a chip. The way they count these mistakes can change depending on how the chip is designed.</p>
            <p>But the two people said that the Panther Lake chips now have about three times more mistakes than what is normal in the industry. This stops Intel from making a lot of these chips.</p>
            <p>According to these people, only 5% of the Panther Lake chips Intel made late last year met the required quality. One person said that by this summer, the quality rate only got better to about 10%.</p>
            <p>But this person warned that Intel might say their quality rate is higher if they count chips that don't meet all performance goals. Reuters cannot say what the exact quality rate is right now.</p>
            <p>Two people who know about Intel's manufacturing said that making many more good chips will be very hard if they want to sell Panther Lake in the fourth quarter of this year. If they cannot improve enough, Intel might have to sell some chips for less profit or even at a loss.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Smart Energy Gets High Credit Rating with Government Support</h1>
            <p>Today, Taiwan Smart Energy (TSE) got a good rating from Fitch Ratings. They received an "A" for their long-term credit as a company that issues debt, and "AA+(twn)" for their long-term credit in Taiwan. The future looks stable because many companies linked to the government support TSE. Fitch expects the government to give more help if needed.</p>
            <p>TSE said that besides Fitch Ratings, they also got an "A-" international long-term credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P) and a "twAA+" domestic long-term rating from Taiwan Ratings. All these ratings are good enough for investing.</p>
            <p>In July, the Fair Trade Commission approved a plan for Taiwan Smart Energy. They said that six companies â€“ China Steel, CPC (Taiwan's oil company), Chunghwa Telecom, ASE, UMC, and Tung Ho Steel â€“ can work together to buy and sell electricity. TSE recently finished raising 1.55 billion New Taiwan Dollars, so now they have 14 shareholders.</p>
            <p>The 14 shareholders of TSE include Taiwan CPC, Chunghwa Telecom, China Steel, Taiwan High Speed Rail, Yao Hua Glass, ITIC, ASE Technology, UMC, Chang Chun Petrochemical, Tung Ho Steel, TECO Group, Sino-American Silicon, Delta Electronics, and Vanguard International Semiconductor. Each company owns between 5% and 12.5% of TSE. Together, the companies linked to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Transportation own more than half of TSE.</p>
            <p>Fitch said that it sees TSE as a company that helps with public policy and has strong ties to the government. Fitch looked past TSE's direct shareholders to the Taiwan government (which has an "AA/stable" rating). Fitch strongly believes that the Taiwan government will give more help to TSE if it needs to.</p>
            <p>Fitch noted that the Taiwan government was very involved in creating and building TSE. Fitch expects the government, through companies it is linked to, to keep most of the shares in TSE. This will give the government strong power over TSE. By the end of 2025, government-related companies will own 52.3% of TSE and will choose 4 out of 7 members for the board of directors.</p>
            <p>Based on the agreement between shareholders, if any shares of TSE are to be transferred, at least 50% of the shares must approve it. This will make sure the government keeps stable control.</p>
            <p>Fitch also said that TSE does not need any financial help, except for the first 1.65 billion New Taiwan Dollars given by the end of 2025. Fitch expects TSE to need very little regular help from the government's budget. This is because TSE's shareholders will take over contracts from buyers who do not pay. This ensures the company fulfills its contract duties.</p>
            <p>Fitch said that all of TSE's shareholders have good credit. This helps them take on contracts if buyers fail to pay. Especially, government-related shareholders use more than 5 billion units of electricity each year. If needed, they can use all of the 4 billion units of electricity that TSE expects to supply each year. These shareholders' credit is linked to the government or they have an "A" rating or higher.</p>
            <p>However, Fitch rated TSE's own credit as "bbb." One big reason for this is that the sales contracts have fixed profit rates. This makes it hard for TSE to raise prices when its costs go up. Because of this, the risk to its income is seen as "weak."</p>
            <p>TSE said that it has talked with Block Development phases 3-1 and 3-2. After the new board of directors is formed, they will decide on buying and evaluating things. A board meeting is expected by the end of August.</p>
