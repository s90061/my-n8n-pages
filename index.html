**Keelung MRT: Not for Profit, Says City Government**

Some people in Keelung are worried that the new Keelung MRT line, when it opens, might not be very useful. They think it might not have enough passengers and could cost the city too much money to run.

The city government, however, said that the Keelung MRT is not made to earn money. Its main goal is to help people travel more easily in Keelung and make train travel less crowded between Shulin and Nangang. They also want it to help develop businesses along the Keelung River area.

The city's transport department explained that building a metro system is very expensive. The money from tickets alone is not enough to cover the running costs. They plan to get money from advertisements, renting out spaces at stations, and other business activities. They also mentioned that other metro systems in Taiwan, like Taichung and Kaohsiung, started with fewer passengers but grew over time with good planning and transport policies.

**Foreign Investors Buy Many Taiwan Stocks Last Week**

Last week, foreign investors bought a lot of stocks in Taiwan, a total of NT$117.2 billion. This happened because the New Taiwan Dollar became stronger, which made it attractive for foreign money to come in. The Taiwan stock market also went up by 534.34 points, reaching a new high.

The stock that foreign investors bought the most was Nanya, with over 123,000 shares. They also bought many shares of UMC and Winbond. TSMC, a very important company, also saw many shares bought by foreign investors.

However, foreign investors also sold some stocks. The top three they sold were Cathay FHC, Taishin FHC, and Pou Chen.

**France and Norway Sign Agreement for Carbon Storage**

France and Norway have made a new agreement that will allow carbon dioxide to be moved across their borders and stored permanently. This is a big step for Europe to create a system for capturing and storing carbon.

The agreement was signed in Oslo. It means that industrial carbon emissions from big French ports like Le Havre and Dunkirk can be sent to Norway. Once there, the carbon dioxide will be put deep underground in rock layers under the North Sea.

This agreement helps France and Norway work together on managing carbon. It also sets up rules for how countries in Europe can work together on carbon capture and storage in the future. Both governments will report on the greenhouse gas emissions related to this cross-border transport and storage to ensure everything is clear and follows the rules.

Norway is also working on building more places to store carbon dioxide. They have given out 12 licenses to look for places to store carbon and have approved one license for a project called "Northern Lights." This project, run by Shell, Equinor, and TotalEnergies, will turn captured industrial carbon emissions from Europe into liquid and store them deep under the seabed to help fight climate change. They expect to start storing carbon in 2025, with plans to store more in the future.
