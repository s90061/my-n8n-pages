            <h1>Chinese Man Arrested for Cheating on TOEIC in Japan for the 5th Time; 14 Others Made the Same Mistakes</h1>
            <p>According to Japan's Kyodo News, Tokyo police arrested Wang Likun, a 27-year-old Chinese graduate student from Kyoto University, again today. He is accused of writing someone else's name on a TOEIC English test answer sheet. This is his fifth arrest.</p>
            <p>Japanese police stated that Wang Likun did not speak. In the test room where he was, about 50 other Chinese students who registered with the same address also took the test. Of these, 14 students got high scores similar to his, and they also made the same mistakes on some questions. Police think this might be group cheating using communication devices.</p>
            <p>On April 20, Wang Likun had already pretended to be someone else at a test center in Toshima Ward, Tokyo, by writing another person's name on an answer sheet. On May 18, he was also suspected of pretending to be someone else to take the TOEIC English test in Tokyo.</p>
            <p>On that day, he not only pretended to be someone else but also hid a small microphone, about 3 to 4 centimeters long, inside his mask. Police arrested him on the spot. After his arrest, 30% of the test-takers in the same room did not show up.</p>
            <p>Tokyo police thought that these absent students might have been cheaters who were supposed to receive answers from Wang Likun. They probably found out something was wrong and decided not to come to the test.</p>
            <p>Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Wang Likun also took tests in June last year and March this year using names that looked Chinese.</p>

            <h1>Alphabet Avoids Selling Chrome, Shares Go Up More Than 9%</h1>
            <p>Alphabet, the company that owns Google, saw its stock price go up by 9.14% today. This happened because investors believe a US court decision about Google's antitrust case was good for the big tech company overall.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a financial news outlet, reported that Alphabet's stock rose strongly today. The company's value increased by 234 billion US dollars, which is about 7 trillion Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>In this antitrust case, which started in September 2023, the US Department of Justice asked the court to make Google separate some of its businesses, including its web browser, Chrome.</p>
            <p>Last year, the court made an important decision, stating that Google illegally controls 90% of the internet search market in the US. However, US Federal District Judge Amit Mehta did not agree with the Department of Justice's strongest punishment idea.</p>
            <p>Google does not have to sell its Chrome browser. In the future, it can still pay device makers or browser companies to put its products on their devices. But it cannot sign special deals that make its search engine the only default option. This means Google can still pay billions of dollars to Apple to be the main search engine on iPhones.</p>
            <p>Even though its main search business faces strong competition from new companies like Perplexity and OpenAI, Google has handled these challenges well so far. Its advertising business continues to grow.</p>
            <p>Judge Mehta also decided that Google can keep its Android operating system. This system, along with the Chrome browser, helps Google's advertising business, which is very powerful online.</p>
            <p>Mehta asked Google to share data with its competitors. This will help strengthen its competitors' advertising businesses. But Google does not need to sell Chrome or Android. This removed big worries for investors, who see Chrome and Android as very important parts of Google's entire business.</p>
