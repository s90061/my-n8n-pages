            <h1>Action Strong Company Reports Loss of NT$4.36 Per Share in Q2 Due to Arbitration Compensation for Liwei</h1>
            <p>Wei Xun (Action Strong), a company, held a press conference today. They announced that their daughter company, Liwei, which Wei Xun owns 77.25% of, must pay about 27 million US dollars (around 791 million New Taiwan Dollars). This is because a customer said Liwei's products were faulty and delivered late. An international court decided this in a business arbitration.</p>
            <p>Lin Yong-xiang, Wei Xun's vice president, said that Liwei is a small company. In 2024, it only made up about 3% of Wei Xun's total sales. Also, because Liwei lost money in 2024, Wei Xun had to record this possible loss from the daughter company. They did this in their mid-year report, following international accounting rules.</p>
            <p>Because Wei Xun recorded this one-time loss of about 791 million New Taiwan Dollars for Liwei's arbitration, Wei Xun's second-quarter report showed a loss. Wei Xun announced today that its net loss for the second quarter was about 490 million New Taiwan Dollars. This means a loss of NT$4.36 per share. This is their first quarterly loss in over seven years. For the first half of the year, their net loss was 330 million New Taiwan Dollars, which is NT$2.94 loss per share.</p>
            <p>Wei Xun explained that in 2021, a customer of Liwei started a business arbitration in the United States. The customer said Liwei's products were faulty and delivered late. The customer first asked for over 18 million US dollars in compensation. Later, they increased the amount to about 143 million US dollars. The international court decided on this case. On July 31st, Taiwan time, the American lawyer sent the decision. Liwei must pay about 27 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Wei Xun said that this arbitration result for Liwei will not greatly affect Wei Xun's money or business. Liwei will work with lawyers to try to reduce the actual loss.</p>
            <p>For Wei Xun, this recorded loss is a one-time accounting entry; it does not mean they have to spend cash now. After recording this loss, Wei Xun's total net worth is 3.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars, and each share is worth 28.3 New Taiwan Dollars. The company's financial health is still good.</p>

            <h1>Rakuten Monkeys Team Manager Apologizes to Players for Food Safety Problem, Says Budget Can Be Changed</h1>
            <p>Makino Kohki, the team manager for the Rakuten Monkeys baseball team in Taiwan, apologized today to the players and coaches. This was about a problem with food safety. He said clearly that they always care about the players' nutrition, and the money for food can be changed if needed. Also, the team announced they are changing their food supplier immediately.</p>
            <p>He said that the food quality was not bad because the budget was too low. If more money is needed, they can change the budget. It is not about how much money they have. "We will carefully check and work with the inspections," he said. If necessary, the team will also change how they handle things.</p>
            <p>News reports said that the Monkeys' players' food had safety problems, like dead flies and live maggots. The Monkeys team released a statement saying they will carefully check new food suppliers to make sure the players' food is safe.</p>
            <p>Makino Kohki spoke to the media and said he was sorry for making everyone worried, and especially sorry to the players and coaches who ate the bad food.</p>
            <p>Before the game, Makino Kohki gathered the whole team to talk. He apologized to the coaches and players. But he also said that the reports saying they do not care about player nutrition or body building are not true. He stated that the team cares most about player nutrition and continues to help players by giving them good nutrition and food.</p>
            <p>He said that after the problem happened, the team immediately decided to change suppliers. They will be very strict when choosing a new supplier. Before they find a new supplier, they will order food for the players. Of course, they will discuss details with the food companies. This includes making sure the cooking process is safe, the delivery is clean, and the eating area for staff is clean.</p>

            <h1>Famine Gets Worse in Gaza: WHO Says Nearly 12,000 Children Under 5 Are Malnourished</h1>
            <p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), said today that about 12,000 children under five years old in Gaza are suffering from serious lack of food. The number of deaths related to hunger is also increasing. He asked for more help to be sent to Gaza.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Tedros said at WHO headquarters in Geneva that in July, about 12,000 children under five in Gaza were found to be very malnourished. This is the highest number for a single month ever recorded.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of this year until July 29th, at least 99 people have died because of hunger. This includes 64 adults and 35 children. Among the children, 29 were under five years old.</p>
            <p>New information from UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) shows that between June and July, the number of children needing treatment for not having enough food almost doubled. It went from 6,344 to 11,877 children. Among these, 2,500 children had serious malnutrition.</p>
            <p>Tedros asked for more and steady help to be sent through all possible ways. WHO said it is supporting four centers in Gaza that treat malnutrition. However, there is a very big shortage of baby formula and special nutritious food.</p>
            <p>Rik Peeperkorn, WHO's representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, spoke by video. He said, "The total amount of food supplies is still far too low to stop the situation from getting worse. There must be enough food in the markets, and people need different kinds of food."</p>
            <p>A group that checks for hunger in the world has warned that there are signs of famine in Gaza. Hunger is spreading, and children are dying because they don't have enough to eat. Also, it is very hard for humanitarian aid to get into this war-torn area.</p>
            <p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said that the amount of food people are eating in Gaza is now the lowest it has been since the war started.</p>
            <p>Gaza has 2.2 million people. 81% of families there say their food situation is very bad. This is a big increase from April, when it was 33%.</p>
