            <h1>Slovakia Changes Constitution, Limits Rights for Same-Sex Couples and Makes Rules for Changing Gender Stricter</h1>
            <p>On September 26, the parliament in Slovakia agreed to change its constitution. These changes will limit the rights of same-sex couples and make it harder for people to change their gender legally. The new rule also says that Slovakia's laws are more important than laws from the European Union (EU).</p>
            <p>The Slovak parliament has 150 members. 90 members voted for the changes, and 7 voted against them. The country's Prime Minister, Robert Fico, who is a nationalist, said yesterday that this vote was a "historic chance to change the constitution."</p>
            <p>Since Prime Minister Fico returned to power in 2023, he has often disagreed with the EU. He has also limited people's rights in Slovakia, which led to protests in the country. Slovakia is a member of both the EU and NATO.</p>
            <p>When the idea for these constitutional changes was announced in late January, Fico said they would build a "constitutional defense against progressive politics." He wanted to use "the traditions, culture, and spiritual heritage of our ancestors" and bring back "basic common sense."</p>
            <p>The proposed changes say that "there are only two genders, male and female, and these are set at birth." This idea is similar to what former US President Donald Trump said in his speech on January 20 this year. In his speech, Trump promised to bring law and order back. He said that the US government would officially recognize only two genders: male and female, starting from that day.</p>
            <p>The proposal also states that "gender cannot be changed unless there is a serious reason, following a process that will be written into law later." The new rules also say that only married couples can adopt children, except in a few special cases.</p>
            <p>Since 2014, Slovakia's constitution has stated that marriage is only between one man and one woman. This was when Fico was also the Prime Minister. The country's constitution says that Slovakia's power over "cultural and ethical issues" should be more important than EU laws.</p>

            <h1>Pan Wei-chieh Scores 30 Points, Leads Chien Hsin to Beat National Chengchi University in Basketball Tournament</h1>
            <p>On September 26, in Taipei, Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology, a strong UBA team, won against the powerful National Chengchi University (NCCU) with a score of 100 to 91. This win was led by Pan Wei-chieh, who scored 30 points. They are now in the championship game for the men's college group of the Elite Youth Basketball Tournament. Pan Wei-chieh said his goal is to become a "3D player" in professional basketball.</p>
            <p>The Elite Youth Basketball Tournament is happening at the Taipei Arena. Chien Hsin, a strong team in the UBA college basketball league, lost their first two games in the first round. They thought they would not make it to the semi-finals. However, in their last game of the first round, they beat St. Clare College from the Philippines by a lot. This allowed them to get the last spot in the semi-finals. Today, they kept their strong performance and beat the powerful NCCU by 9 points. This means they are now in the men's college championship game.</p>
            <p>Pan Wei-chieh, who is now a senior student, scored the most points in this game with 30 points. He made 4 three-point shots. Wang Ding-chun also scored 21 points. Together, they helped Chien Hsin win this important game. After the game, Pan Wei-chieh spoke to the media. He said he wants to be a professional basketball player in the future. So, during the summer, he worked on his attacking skills, especially shooting from outside after a screen. His goal is to be a "3D player," meaning someone who can shoot well from far away and also play good defense.</p>
            <p>For NCCU, who will not play in the championship game, a main player, Wu Chih-kai, accidentally hurt his lip by hitting an electronic sign before the game ended. He was taken to the hospital right away. The head coach, Chen Tzu-wei, said that losing is not always bad. He said it can remind the players that every year is hard. He also mentioned that he had planned to let players who usually don't play much get more time on the court. But many younger players had injuries, so they had to rely on older players like Wu Chih-kai, Lin Tzu-hao, and Hsu Te-chi.</p>
            <p>However, Coach Chen Tzu-wei pointed out that new player Hsieh Yun-da played very well in this tournament, which was a great outcome. Hsieh Yun-da not only scored 19 points in this game, the second-highest for his team, but he also made a surprising dunk when he was tired at the end of the game. Coach Chen Tzu-wei said he was very surprised by it.</p>

            <h1>US Government Immigration Video Uses Pok√© Ball; Japan's Pok√©mon Company Says It Was Not Allowed</h1>
            <p>On September 26, in Tokyo, a video from the US government has been shared a lot online recently. It connects the Pok√©mon slogan, "Gotta Catch 'Em All," with the government's actions against illegal immigrants. Today, the Pok√©mon company in Japan said that they did not allow their brand to be used in this video.</p>
            <p>This week, the US Department of Homeland Security put a video on the social media platform X. The video showed officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during their operations.</p>
            <p>In the video, police officers with guns and border patrol agents put handcuffs on people who they thought were illegal immigrants. At the same time, the English Pok√©mon theme song played in the background.</p>
            <p>Throughout the video, the main character, Ash (known as Ash in North America), was shown many times throwing a Pok√© Ball. A Pok√© Ball is a tool used in the Pok√©mon series to catch and keep wild Pok√©mon.</p>
            <p>The Pok√©mon brand, which is part of Nintendo in Japan, said that they did not help make or share the video.</p>
            <p>The Pok√©mon public relations department sent a statement to the AFP news agency. It said, "We have never given permission for our intellectual property to be used."</p>
            <p>This month, President Trump's government in the US started a new operation in Chicago called "Operation Midway Blitz." They said it was to catch "the worst criminals."</p>
            <p>Pok√©mon became very popular worldwide after it was first released in 1996. The idea for Pok√©mon came from a Japanese tradition where children catch insects in the summer. It lets players experience catching and training "pocket monsters."</p>
            <p>Today, the Pok√©mon brand includes movies, animated TV shows, and the augmented reality mobile game "Pok√©mon Go."</p>
