  <h2 style="color: #333;">NBA News: LeBron James Stays with Lakers for Record 23rd Season</h2>

  <p>LeBron James, a famous basketball player, will continue to play for the Los Angeles Lakers. His agent, Rich Paul, told ESPN that James has decided to use his player option for the 2025-26 season. This means he will earn $52.6 million.</p>

  <p>This upcoming season will be James's 23rd in the NBA, which is a new record. Paul mentioned that James, who is 40 years old, wants to win more championships. He will be watching closely to see if the Lakers build a team that can win.</p>

  <p>James is the NBA's all-time leading scorer. He previously said he wasn't sure if this would be his last season or if he would play for many more years.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #333;">TikTok in US: Trump Says He Found Rich Buyers</h2>

  <p>TikTok, a popular video app owned by China's ByteDance, might be banned in the U.S. if it's not sold. The deadline for this sale has been moved three times. Former U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview today that he has found buyers for TikTok.</p>

  <p>Trump told Fox News Channel that he found a group of "very rich people" who want to buy the app. He also said he might need approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping for the sale to happen, and he believes President Xi might agree.</p>

  <p>Trump did not share many details about the buyers, but he said he would announce them in about two weeks. A U.S. law requires TikTok to be sold because of national security concerns, or it will face a ban in the country.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #333;">China Allows Some Japanese Seafood Imports, Excluding Fukushima and Other Areas</h2>

  <p>China announced today that it will allow some seafood products from Japan to be imported again. This decision comes after China's customs said they have been monitoring Japan's Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge for a long time. Their own tests have not shown any problems.</p>

  <p>Also, the Japanese government has promised that seafood sent to China will be safe and of good quality. However, seafood from 10 Japanese areas, including Fukushima and Tokyo, will still not be allowed into China. This new rule means a ban from 2023 is now over for certain areas.</p>

  <p>Chinese customs said that Japanese seafood companies wanting to sell to China must follow China's rules for food safety and registration. Companies whose imports were stopped must apply again to be registered. China will closely check all Japanese seafood imports and will take action if any problems are found or if Japan does not keep its promises about safety.</p>
