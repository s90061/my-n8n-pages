            <h1>Online Video Shows Chinese Warship Broadcast; Coast Guard Says It's Edited and Reversed</h1>
            <p>An online video shows a Chinese warship and coast guard boat broadcasting messages while the "Lianjiang ship" was moving away Chinese fishing boats. The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said today that this video combines two separate events from different times and places. The video was edited and played backward. The CGA has corrected this information and strongly condemns it.</p>
            <p>The Ocean Affairs Council Coast Guard Administration stated in a press release tonight that from September 12 to 14, the "Lianjiang ship" was on patrol duty in the waters around Penghu. The ship found Chinese fishing boats, such as "Yuenanao 31067," in the sea 24 to 26 nautical miles outside Mudou Islet and Huayu, Penghu. The "Lianjiang ship" then broadcast messages to make them leave Taiwan's waters.</p>
            <p>Also, on September 13 and 14, the "Lianjiang ship" found Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) warship "645" 28.6 nautical miles northwest of Mudou Islet, outside the restricted waters. The "Lianjiang ship" continued to watch the "645" warship with a Navy ship. It did not pay attention to the "one-China statement" broadcast by the "645" warship.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard said that watching the Chinese "645" warship and moving away the Chinese fishing boats were two different events, happening at different times and in different places.</p>
            <p>Regarding the online video that shows the PLA warship and Coast Guard boat broadcasting messages when the "Lianjiang ship" was moving away Chinese fishing boats, the CGA said that the video was made by editing and reversing audio and video clips of the "Lianjiang ship's" law enforcement actions. The CGA has explained this to make it clear.</p>
            <p>The CGA said that China's actions, which are like information warfare, try to make it seem like the "Lianjiang ship" was stopped by a PLA warship while doing its job. The CGA strongly condemns this. It also asks China to control its ships and not illegally enter Taiwan's waters.</p>
            <p>In addition, on September 6, the Coast Guard stopped and took a Chinese fishing boat and its 15 crew members who had illegally entered Taiwan's waters. One ton of illegally caught fish was thrown back into the sea. The case is now being investigated and penalties are being applied according to the Act Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</p>
            <p>The CGA stated that it will keep sending large ships to guard the waters around Penghu. It will also work with the Penghu Coast Guard team to strongly stop Chinese fishing boats that illegally enter Taiwan's waters. This will help protect the country's power over its waters and its rights to the ocean, making sure that ocean resources can be used for a long time.</p>

            <h1>Minister Chen Jun-ji Leads Agricultural Delegation to US to Sign Purchase Agreements in Washington and Agricultural States</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced today that the "2025 Republic of China (Taiwan) Agricultural Product Trade Friendly Visit Delegation to the United States" is led by Minister of Agriculture Chen Jun-ji. From today until September 27, the delegation will visit Washington D.C. They will sign agreements to buy agricultural products with related US agricultural groups. This aims to strengthen economic, trade, and food security partnerships.</p>
            <p>MOFA sent out a press release this evening, stating that the "2025 Republic of China (Taiwan) Agricultural Product Trade Friendly Visit Delegation to the United States" will visit Washington D.C. and different agricultural states from today until September 27. They will sign purchase agreements with relevant US agricultural associations. This is the 15th time Taiwan has sent an agricultural delegation to the US since 1998.</p>
            <p>MOFA explained that this year, Minister of Agriculture Chen Jun-ji is the head of the delegation. Members include important representatives from Taiwan's vegetable oil manufacturing industry, animal feed industry, flour industry, poultry meat marketing association, frozen food industry, chain store promotion association, the American Soybean Export Council, the U.S. Grains Council, and U.S. Wheat Associates.</p>
            <p>MOFA pointed out that the delegation will first visit Washington D.C. After that, they will divide into three groupsâ€”"Soybeans and Corn," "Wheat," and "Beef"â€”to visit US agricultural states. They will talk and exchange ideas with local government officials and agricultural groups.</p>
            <p>The "Soybeans and Corn" group will visit Arkansas, Ohio, and Indiana. The "Wheat" group will visit South Dakota, Montana, and Idaho. The "Beef" group will visit Florida and Texas.</p>
            <p>MOFA stressed that Taiwan and the US have continued to work more closely in areas like agricultural innovation technology and food security supply chains in recent years. High-quality American agricultural products are also popular with people in Taiwan. Last year, Taiwan was the eighth-largest market for US exports, buying mainly agricultural and livestock products like soybeans, corn, wheat, and beef.</p>
            <p>MOFA also hopes that sending another agricultural delegation will combine the power of Taiwan's public and private sectors. This will help agricultural cooperation and communication between the two sides and further strengthen the economic, trade, and food security partnership between Taiwan and the US.</p>

            <h1>Russian Drone Enters Polish Airspace; US Secretary of State Says It's Unacceptable</h1>
            <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that a Russian drone flew into Polish airspace earlier this week during attacks on Ukraine. He called this a "sad and dangerous event."</p>
            <p>Rubio said in Washington D.C., "The question is whether these drones went into Poland on purpose. If there is proof that they did, then the situation will clearly become... much more serious."</p>
            <p>On September 11, US President Trump suggested that the Russian drone might have "accidentally" entered Polish airspace, but this idea worried European countries.</p>
            <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk disagreed. He wrote on the social media platform X, "Of course, we also hope it was an accident, but that is not the truth, and we know it."</p>
            <p>Polish officials stated that on September 10, 17 Russian drones entered their eastern airspace and were shot down. Luckily, no one was hurt, and there was no major damage. The remains of the drones have been found.</p>
            <p>These drones were clearly sent by Russia. Russia had earlier refused Trump's request for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Poland is a member of NATO, and its safety is protected by the NATO alliance, which is led by the US.</p>
            <p>Many European countries and the European Union (EU) see this event as Russia testing NATO's determination.</p>
