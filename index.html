            <h1>Taiwan and Czech Republic Meeting: Czech Republic Promises Help with Electricity for Taiwanese Businesses</h1>
            <p>The 8th Taiwan-Czech Economic and Technology Meeting has finished. During discussions about investments, Taiwanese businesses in the Czech Republic said they did not have enough electricity. The Czech Republic said it would actively help solve this problem. Also, in March this year, the Czech Republic put Taiwan on a list of countries whose citizens do not need a work visa. This shows that the Czech Republic cares about Taiwanese businesses investing there.</p>
            <p>On September 15, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chiang Wen-Jo and Mr. David MÃ¼ller, Director-General for EU and Foreign Trade at the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade, led the 8th Taiwan-Czech Economic and Technology Meeting together. They talked about global economic changes. They also discussed how to promote trade, new investments, working together in industries, and economic safety.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wen-Jo said that global trade and the economy have been very uncertain recently. But international groups that predict the economy still think Taiwan's economy will grow well in 2025. She also mentioned three big challenges: changing global politics, new tariffs from the US, and limits on important materials and technologies. Taiwan's government is talking closely with businesses and offering support. It is also promoting "Five Major Trust Industries" and "Trust Supply Chain" plans to build good relationships with democratic partners like the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>MÃ¼ller said that the world situation is still changing. Because of new tariffs from the US, the Czech Republic is working hard to build partnerships with countries like Taiwan that have similar ideas. This will make trade and economic interactions stronger and help their industries compete better in the world.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Foreign Trade said that both sides talked about trade. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs explained how it is making the exhibition industry more digital and reducing carbon emissions. The Czech side was impressed and hopes to learn from Taiwan's experience. They want more Czech companies to join exhibitions in Taiwan to increase trade between the two countries.</p>
            <p>Regarding investments, the Bureau of Foreign Trade said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs told the Czech side that the Taiwan Trade and Investment Center in Prague is now open. It can work with the Czech Republic to help Taiwanese businesses. For the problems reported by Taiwanese businesses in the Czech Republic, such as not enough electricity, the Czech Republic said it would actively help. They also mentioned that in March this year, Taiwan was added to the list of countries whose citizens do not need a work visa, showing their care for Taiwanese investments.</p>
            <p>For industry cooperation, the Bureau of Foreign Trade said both sides agreed to continue working together on semiconductors through the "Taiwan-Czech Resilience Plan." They also agreed that artificial intelligence is very important in the world's technology supply chains. They will share more policies and ideas to make their industries more competitive. Both sides will also keep sending groups of smart city companies to visit each other and share new solutions.</p>
            <p>About economic safety and important minerals, both sides were happy to have meetings to share ways to recycle important minerals. As global trade and economic situations change, both sides hope to continue working together to build a good economic partnership that benefits everyone.</p>
            <p>According to Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, in 2024, the Czech Republic was Taiwan's biggest trade partner in Central and Eastern Europe. Trade between them was 2.37 billion US dollars, which is 94.79% more than the year before. For investments, by the end of July 2025, most Taiwanese investments in the Czech Republic were in information and communication technology. The total investment was 220 million US dollars. Taiwan is now the 9th biggest investor among EU countries.</p>

            <h1>Thai Police Use Tear Gas on Cambodian Protesters; Border Dispute Causes New Conflict</h1>
            <p>Thai and Cambodian officials said that Thai police used tear gas and rubber bullets on Cambodian citizens today. This happened in a border area where both countries claim to own the land. This is the most serious problem since July, when both countries agreed to stop fighting after five days of deadly conflict.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that according to Cambodian officials, at least 23 Cambodians were hurt. The Thai army also said some Thai people were hurt, but they did not say how many.</p>
            <p>The fighting happened in a village on the border between Thailand and Cambodia. Thailand says the area is part of Sa Kaeo province. Cambodia says it is part of Banteay Meanchey province.</p>
            <p>Last month, Thai officials put up a barbed wire fence in this area. For several weeks, people from both sides of the border have been protesting there.</p>
            <p>The land border between Thailand and Cambodia is 817 kilometers long. For over a hundred years, both countries have argued about who owns several parts of the border that are not clearly marked. France first drew the border line in 1907 when Cambodia was a French colony.</p>
            <p>In July this year, the disagreements about the land led to fighting at the border. Thailand and Cambodia had their worst battles in decades. At least 48 people died, and hundreds of thousands of people had to leave their homes for a short time.</p>
            <p>Malaysia helped the two countries talk. On July 28, they agreed to stop fighting. Since then, the border has been mostly peaceful until now.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Health and Welfare: Statement of 600 Newborn Deaths in Taiwan Each Year is Wrong</h1>
            <p>Some news reports said that "600 newborn babies die in Taiwan every year." Today, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) said this is not correct. For the last three years, the death rate for "newborns under four weeks old" has been 2.8 deaths for every 1000 live births. This rate has stayed the same. In 2024, 374 newborns died, which is 3 fewer than in 2023.</p>
            <p>Today, many news outlets said that experts claimed "600 newborns die in Taiwan every year, and Taiwan has been higher than Japan and South Korea for 20 years." Later, the public relations company that gave out this information explained that the number was actually for "babies under one year old."</p>
            <p>However, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's integrated platform for children's medical health information, the newborn death rate means the number of babies who die within four weeks (28 days) for every 1000 live births.</p>
            <p>Because of this, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Department of Statistics released a press statement this evening. They said that "600 newborn babies die in Taiwan every year" is a wrong statement. But the MOHW did not give the newest information about the death rate for babies under one year old, or how it compares to Japan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>The MOHW stated that in 2024, 374 newborns died. This is 3 fewer than the 377 deaths in 2023. The death rate for every 1000 live births was 2.8. If deaths of babies born before 22 weeks of pregnancy or weighing less than 500 grams are not included, the number was 242. This is 18 fewer than the 260 deaths in 2023. The death rate per 1000 live births in this specific group went down from 1.9 to 1.8.</p>
            <p>Looking at the numbers from 2022 to 2024, the Department of Statistics said that the newborn death rate per 1000 live births stayed at 2.8. If deaths of babies born before 22 weeks of pregnancy or weighing less than 500 grams are not included, the death rate per 1000 live births went down from 2.0 in 2018 to 1.8 in 2024.</p>
            <p>The MOHW stressed that it is always working to improve the medical care system for children. Since 2021, they have been running the "Optimizing Children's Medical Care Plan." This plan builds a three-level medical care network. It starts giving help from the beginning of life by improving care during pregnancy and birth, sending high-risk pregnant women to special care, and providing services for newborns. It also sets up emergency medical points for children.</p>
            <p>The MOHW also said it is starting a special doctor system for young children. This system gives basic care and health management for children under three years old. This will help to reduce preventable deaths of newborns and children and improve children's health.</p>
