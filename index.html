            <h1>"Cishan Banana Music Festival" Starts; Mayor Chen Chi-mai Promotes Local Farm Products</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung, September 27 (CNA) â€“ The 2025 "Cishan Banana Music Festival" started today at the Cishan Stadium. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai promoted local quality farm products and gave out awards for the 2025 Banana Quality Evaluation. He said that Cishan bananas are very famous around the world, and in the past, Cishan bananas were the most important farm product exported from Kaohsiung.</p>
            <p>At the opening ceremony, Mayor Chen Chi-mai showed the festival's mascot, "Auntie Cishan Golden Banana." This mascot continues the popularity of last year's mascot, "Uncle Cishan Golden Banana." Mayor Chen and the Golden Banana couple helped make the event lively and exciting.</p>
            <p>"The city of Kaohsiung is changing, but Kaohsiung's Cishan bananas are still the best tasting bananas in the world," Mayor Chen said during his speech. He added that Cishan bananas are famous worldwide. In the past, Cishan bananas were Kaohsiung's main export. Because of this, Kaohsiung Port had a "Banana Pier." Now, the Banana Pier will host high-tech companies like NVIDIA and ASPEED Technology.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen said that when he hosts foreign guests, he always offers Cishan bananas. Dashu pineapples and Meinong 147 rice are also important items for diplomacy, and they are the best gifts. He wants to share the best farm products from Taiwan with all good friends around the world.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen also said that Kaohsiung has worked hard on exports in recent years. At the Tokyo Food Show earlier this year, Kaohsiung's bananas, pineapples, and wax apples were promoted internationally. This gave other countries a chance to enjoy Kaohsiung's excellent farm products. He also thanked the Agricultural and Food Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture for giving disaster relief money to farmers when they faced problems. The agency also helps by buying bananas for processing, which improves the banana industry and helps farmers earn money.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Mayor Chen visited the local small farmer's market. He tasted fresh and sweet Cishan bananas directly from the farm, and also handmade desserts made with local bananas. He invited everyone to visit Cishan to taste the good local flavors.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Summer Market's exciting final event, "Cishan Banana Music Festival," is happening today and tomorrow at the Cishan Stadium. The event has 7 main themes: a small farmer's market, fresh fruit tasting, creative farm crafts, fun knowledge challenges, visits to Cishan's rural culture, a children's playground, and a banana ecology classroom, among many other activities.</p>

            <h1>Nelson Chang: Imported Cement Shows "Transfer Effect"; Government Must Address Unfair Competition</h1>
            <p>Hualien, September 27 (CNA) â€“ Nelson Chang, chairman of Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC), pointed out that at the end of July this year, the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration put anti-dumping taxes on Portland cement from Vietnam. However, starting in August, the amount of cement imported from Indonesia grew by more than 50%. This shows a "transfer effect." Taiwan is one of the few countries in the world that has no tariffs on imported cement. Only putting anti-dumping taxes on one country cannot solve the main problem. He asks the government to look at the unfair competition from imported cement, which has no tariffs and no carbon fees.</p>
            <p>Today, Nelson Chang was in Hualien for the opening of TCC's Resource Recycling Center. After the event, he said that the Cement Manufacturers' Association and the government talked for a year and a half before the government decided to put anti-dumping taxes on Portland cement from Vietnam. But he believes that taking action against only one country will not completely solve the problem.</p>
            <p>He explained that according to statistics from the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration, the amount of cement and clinker imported into Taiwan in the first eight months of this year was 10% less from Vietnam compared to the same time last year. However, it grew by 54% from Indonesia. This shows that after the government put anti-dumping taxes on cement from Vietnam at the end of July this year, the source of imported cement changed. News from China Cement website reports that the Indonesian cement market includes 9 million tons from Conch Cement's investments and 7 million tons from Red Lion Cement's production.</p>
            <p>Nelson Chang also pointed out that Taiwan is one of the few countries in the world that has no import tariffs on cement. Local companies have to pay carbon fees, but imported cement does not have this carbon cost. "The carbon from imported goods is counted in Taiwan, but we have to pay carbon fees for exported products. This is very unfair," he stated.</p>
            <p>He said that rules for public construction projects require that cement used for the same project must come from the same place. This is to make sure the quality is constant and the project is safe. TCC's cement from its Heping and Su-ao plants can be traced back to its origin and follows these rules. In contrast, imported cement often comes from many different places and does not have a clear tracking system, yet a lot of it is still sold in the market.</p>
            <p>Nelson Chang said that imported cement usually comes in large bags for concrete factories. When it is unloaded, it can create a lot of dust, which pollutes the area. If the government does not check and manage this more carefully, imported cement could cause problems with quality control and environmental protection. This would lead to unfair competition for local businesses.</p>
            <p>TCC asks the government to require imported cement clinker to show its carbon emissions. They also ask the government to consider collecting a carbon payment or creating a Taiwan version of CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism). This way, the hard work of local industries will not be wasted.</p>
            <p>Also, when asked about the fire at Sanyuan Energy in Kaohsiung and the outlook for the fourth quarter, Nelson Chang only said that for Sanyuan Energy, they would have to wait for the fire investigation to finish before they could get insurance money. He did not want to say more. However, he emphasized that operations in Taiwan, mainland China, and Europe are stable, but the fire at Sanyuan Energy has greatly affected TCC's profits.</p>
