            <h1>Song Xinhao Scores 29 Points in Asia University Basketball League, NCCU Beats Beijing Tsinghua to Win Championship</h1>
            <p>The Asia University Basketball League happened in Hangzhou, China. The NCCU Griffins, the only team from Taiwan, won the championship game today. Song Xinhao scored 29 points, the most in the game. They beat Beijing Tsinghua University 82 to 79.</p>
            <p>The Asia University Basketball League (AUBL) is supported by Joseph Tsai, who is from Taiwan and leads Alibaba Group. The NCCU Griffins had already won the UBA university basketball league five times in a row this year. They were the only team from Taiwan and showed they were very strong in this big competition. They also beat Etugen University from Mongolia in the semi-finals yesterday. This meant they got to play in the final game against Beijing Tsinghua University.</p>
            <p>When the first quarter started, NCCU's main guard, Song Xinhao, was again the leader of the offense. Another guard, Hsu Te-chi, also scored well. The foreign player, Popoka, played strongly near the basket. Together, they helped NCCU stay close in points and led by 3 points at half-time.</p>
            <p>After half-time, both teams played strong defense, which made it harder to score many points. But NCCU still found ways to score. In the fourth quarter, they were even ahead by 15 points. It looked like they would win easily. But then, NCCU made many mistakes, and the other team scored 11 points in a row. This made the score very close, with only a 4-point difference with 19.4 seconds left. The game became exciting again.</p>
            <p>However, with 18.2 seconds left, Lin Zi-hao made two free throws for NCCU, which secured their win. Song Xinhao also made an important block, stopping the other team from catching up. NCCU won the game by 3 points and became the champions of the Asia University Basketball League.</p>
            <p>In this game, Song Xinhao continued his great scoring from yesterday. He scored the most points with 29, and also had 12 rebounds and 6 assists. He was the most important player for NCCU's win. Hsu Te-chi, another guard, made 4 three-point shots, scoring 20 points, with 4 rebounds and 3 assists. Popoka, the strong player near the basket, got a "double-double" with 10 points and 11 rebounds.</p>

            <h1>Tamsui Fireworks and Folk Song Concert: Fishermen's Wharf Attracts Over 80,000 People for Fun</h1>
            <p>The last part of the Tamsui Fishermen's Wharf Midsummer Fun event took place tonight. It included a folk song concert and a big fireworks show. More than 80,000 people came to enjoy it. New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that after the Danjiang Bridge and Danbei Road are finished, more people will want to live in Tamsui.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei Midsummer Fun event had fireworks and other activities for three weeks. Tonight was the final night. First, there was a concert called "Next Stop, Let's Sing Folk Songs Together." Then, at 8 PM, the main event was the "Lover's Bridge" themed fireworks show over the Tamsui River. Because of this, people started coming in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih gave a speech at the folk song concert tonight. He said that when he first started working in New Taipei, Tamsui only had about 120,000 people. Now, there are 200,000 people. The Danjiang Bridge will be finished and open in March next year. After that, the Bali Light Rail and the second phase of the Danhai Light Rail will be built. When Danbei Road is also finished, all these new roads and trains will create a good transport network. Tamsui will be a better place to live, with less traffic, and more people will choose to live there.</p>
            <p>Later, the "Lover's Bridge" fireworks show started at 8 PM. The city government said that the idea came from the Magpie Bridge for Qixi Festival (Chinese Valentine's Day). It had many different kinds of fireworks and lights on the water. It was a special way to show love on a summer night. Arch-shaped fireworks made it look like a love bridge. This, with the bridge's lights and moving fireworks, looked like lovers walking hand in hand over a bridge.</p>
            <p>The city government also said that 12-inch high-altitude fireworks were used. These showed big light balls like peonies and dahlias, shining brightly. It looked like a magical rain of flowers falling from the night sky, showing how feelings grow. Fireworks like "Tiger Tail" and "Thousand Wheels" were set off on the water. These made a beautiful "thousand-flower tree," with many light flowers blooming on the Tamsui River. The fireworks show used a changing speed and different heights â€“ low, middle, and high â€“ to create a creative and romantic summer celebration.</p>
            <p>The city government estimated that over 80,000 people watched the fireworks from both the Bali and Tamsui sides. Even though there were many people and cars, the police and metro staff helped to keep traffic moving well.</p>
