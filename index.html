            <h1>Sri Lanka's New Government Fights Corruption; Former President Wickremesinghe Arrested</h1>
            <p>Police in Sri Lanka, a country in South Asia, arrested former President Wickremesinghe today. They arrested him for corruption. This makes him the most important opposition leader arrested since the new left-wing government of President Dissanayake started its fight against corruption.</p>
            <p>AFP (Agence France-Presse) reported that Dissanayake won the presidential election last September. He promised to fight corruption and beat Wickremesinghe. After he became president, the country's anti-corruption agency started its work to stop corruption.</p>
            <p>A Sri Lankan police officer told AFP that Wickremesinghe, who is 76 years old, was questioned. He was asked about issues related to a trip to London, UK, in September 2023. He went to attend a ceremony at a British university for his wife. After questioning, he was taken into custody.</p>
            <p>The police officer also said that they charged Wickremesinghe with using government money for personal reasons. He said, "We will take him to the local judge in Colombo Fort."</p>
            <p>Before going to London, Wickremesinghe had attended the G77 summit in Havana, the capital of Cuba. On his way back, he stopped in London. He went with his wife, Maithree, to a ceremony where the University of Wolverhampton gave her an honorary professor title.</p>
            <p>The Sri Lanka Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) accused Wickremesinghe of using public money to pay for his personal trip. They also said that the government paid for his bodyguards.</p>
            <p>Wickremesinghe's office had earlier said that he did not misuse his position as president for his visit to London. He also said that his wife paid for her trip to the UK herself and did not use any public money.</p>
            <p>Since Dissanayake became president, several important Sri Lankan opposition politicians have been put in jail for corruption. Some were given sentences of up to 25 years. These people include two former high-level ministers.</p>

            <h1>Shenmao Did Not Pay NT$87.29 Million; This Is the Highest Amount This Year and the Second Company Listed on the Stock Market</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market has been changing a lot after reaching new highs this week. Today, there was news of another large amount of defaulted transactions. The Taiwan Stock Exchange announced tonight that two stockbrokers, Capital Securities Donghu and Hwa Nan Securities Fengyuan, reported that Shenmao, a company that makes parts for circuit boards (PCBs), failed to complete transactions worth NT$87.2956 million. This is the largest amount this year.</p>
            <p>This is the second time this year that a listed company has had such a large amount of defaulted transactions. Before this, on August 4, brokers also reported that Thunder Tiger Corporation had a large defaulted transaction of NT$58.7657 million. Including both listed and OTC (Over-the-Counter) companies, this is the ninth large defaulted transaction in the market this year.</p>
            <p>According to Taiwan's "T+2" payment system, the stock exchange announced today that the default in payment happened during stock trading on Wednesday, August 20. On that day, Shenmao's stock price dropped by NT$10.6, ending at its lowest possible price of NT$95.9.</p>
            <p>Recently, there has been a lack of raw materials for making PCBs, which has caused big changes in the stock prices of related companies. On August 19, the GreTai Securities Market also announced that First Securities reported that Golden Edge Copper Foils, a company that makes copper foil, had a large defaulted transaction of NT$10.93 million.</p>
