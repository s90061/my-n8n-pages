            <h1>Brazil Plans Trade Action Against US 50% Tariffs; Businesses Are Worried and Ask for Talks</h1>
            <p>On August 29, in response to US President Donald Trump putting a high 50% tax on products from Brazil, the Brazilian embassy in the United States officially told the US Trade Representative (USTR) that it would start taking action against it. This news has made many businesses very concerned.</p>
            <p>News channels like CNN Brazil reported that on August 28, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry told the Foreign Trade Committee (Camex) to start an investigation. They will check if they should act against the US, based on the "Economic Parity Law" passed this year.</p>
            <p>Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has approved starting this process. The Foreign Trade Committee will give a report within 30 days to decide if the US actions meet the conditions for Brazil to act back. If they decide it is possible, a special group will be formed. This group will create a plan for action, including goods, services, and intellectual property.</p>
            <p>President Lula said that if the US wants to talk, "Lula of peace and love" will be there. Vice President Geraldo Alckmin also said that Brazil will protect its rights but is still open to talking and discussing things.</p>
            <p>However, businesses in Brazil are mostly worried about the government's plan. Eduardo Lobo, who leads the Brazilian Fisheries Industry Association (Abipesca), said that businesses are losing customers every day. He fears that this action will make problems worse and hurt exports.</p>
            <p>A person from the coffee industry called this move a "disaster." They said it causes big concerns for all industries and could make the US put even higher taxes on Brazilian products.</p>
            <p>The Brazilian textile industry has asked the government to be careful. They said it is still early, and it is not clear if they will actually take action. Industry leaders want talks first. They believe that a "fight fire with fire" plan might not be helpful.</p>
            <p>A group of Brazilian business representatives will soon go to Washington for a business visit. The National Confederation of Industry (CNI) also supports solving the problem through talks. They said that industries will keep working for sensible discussions. They think now is not the right time to use the "Economic Parity Law."</p>

            <h1>US Appeals Court Says Trump's Global Tariffs Are Not Legal, But Can Continue for Now</h1>
            <p>On August 29, a US federal appeals court decided that most of the taxes (tariffs) President Donald Trump put on products from many trade partners are against the law. The court found that he went beyond his power when he put these taxes in place.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, this decision is a problem for Trump. He has often used tariffs as a main tool in his economic plans.</p>
            <p>However, the judges decided that these tariffs can stay for now. They will send the case back to a lower court to be looked at again.</p>

            <h1>US Open: Alcaraz Moves to Fourth Round, Rybakina Beats Raducanu</h1>
            <p>On August 29, in New York, Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz moved into the fourth round of the US Open. Kazakhstani player Elena Rybakina also won against British player Emma Raducanu and will continue in the tournament. Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic and last year's women's champion Aryna Sabalenka are also fighting to keep their hopes of winning alive.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Alcaraz, who is the second seed, easily beat Luciano Darderi from Italy (the 32nd seed) in three sets: 6-2, 6-4, 6-0.</p>
            <p>Alcaraz, who won the US Open in 2022, finished his match in only 1 hour and 44 minutes. On August 31, he will play against French player Arthur Rinderknech. Rinderknech won his match against Benjamin Bonzi, also from France, with scores of 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.</p>
            <p>Alcaraz won the French Open in June but lost at Wimbledon last month. He is working hard to do well at the US Open.</p>
            <p>Later today, 38-year-old Djokovic will play against British player Cameron Norrie in a night match. He hopes to move to the next round to play Alcaraz in the semifinals.</p>
            <p>Djokovic, who is the seventh seed, is trying to win a record 25th Grand Slam singles title at the US Open. He has won the US Open four times before.</p>
            <p>In the women's singles, the world number one player, Sabalenka, will play against Leylah Fernandez (the 31st seed) in a night match.</p>
            <p>Sabalenka, from Belarus, is trying to be the first player since American star Serena Williams (who won in 2012, 2013, and 2014) to win the US Open women's singles title two times in a row.</p>
            <p>Fernandez, from Canada, reached the US Open final in 2021. However, she lost to British player Emma Raducanu. Raducanu is the only player in history to win a Grand Slam singles title after starting from the qualifying rounds.</p>
            <p>But Raducanu's hopes for another surprising run in New York this year ended today. She lost to Elena Rybakina (the ninth seed) with scores of 1-6, 2-6.</p>
            <p>Speaking about Rybakina, who won Wimbledon in 2022, Raducanu said, "I think Rybakina played very well. It was hard for me to find any rhythm in the match."</p>
