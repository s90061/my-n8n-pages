            <h1>CSPTC to Set Up Safety Department on Oct 20, Handling 8 Tasks Including Workplace Bullying Fines</h1>
            <p>The Civil Service Protection and Training Commission (CSPTC) will create a new department on October 20. This department will handle 8 main tasks, including overseeing safety for civil servants at work and punishing workplace bullying. This change comes after new laws were made. If a head of a government office or a manager is found to have bullied someone at work, they could be fined up to NT$1 million (around US$31,000).</p>
            <p>The Examination Yuan recently changed the rules for the CSPTC. These changes will start on October 20 this year.</p>
            <p>The CSPTC said that these changes are needed because new laws were passed. President Lai Ching-te announced changes to the Civil Service Protection Act on July 9. Also, new rules about safety and health for civil servants at work started on June 29. These new laws mean the CSPTC has more duties. So, the CSPTC is planning to combine some departments, create new ones, and add more staff.</p>
            <p>The new Safety and Health Protection Department will manage 8 main tasks. First, it will plan and carry out policies and laws for civil servants' safety and health at work. Second, it will check government offices for safety and health, making sure they follow rules. It will also tell them to improve if needed. Third, it will create groups to review serious accidents or deaths at work to understand why they happened.</p>
            <p>Fourth, it will fine government offices that do not follow safety and health rules for civil servants. Fifth, it will keep track of and fine government office heads and managers who are found guilty of workplace bullying. Sixth, it will teach and help prevent work-related accidents and stop workplace bullying in government offices. Seventh, it will look at reports from government offices about their safety and health measures each year. Eighth, it will handle other related tasks.</p>
            <p>Also, other departments in the CSPTC will change. The original "Protection Department" will become the "Protection Legal Affairs Department." It will handle legal matters for civil servants in central government. The "Local Civil Service Protection Department" will become the "Protection Guidance Department." It will handle cases for local civil servants and also promote and guide protection services. The "Training and Development Department" and "Training and Evaluation Department" will join together to become the "Training and Development Department." This new department will bring together training policies and resources.</p>
            <p>In June this year, the Legislative Yuan passed new parts of the Civil Service Protection Act. These new parts clearly define workplace bullying, make it easier to report problems, and hold people responsible. It also states that if a head of a government office or a manager is found to have bullied someone, they can be fined up to NT$1 million.</p>

            <h1>Light Fasting After Holiday Feasts: Doctors Warn 4 Groups Not to Try It</h1>
            <p>After many holidays like Mid-Autumn Festival and Double Ten Day, people often eat a lot. Some try "light fasting" to quickly get back on track. Doctors warn that fasting is not good for everyone. Pregnant women, teenagers, people with poorly controlled blood sugar, and those taking blood sugar medicine should not try it. It could harm their health.</p>
            <p>Many famous people and internet stars have talked about "168 fasting" (eating for 8 hours, not eating for 16 hours) and "1410 fasting" (eating for 10 hours, not eating for 14 hours). Dr. Chen Wei-lung, a doctor who works with internal medicine and weight loss, recently said that light fasting after a big meal can help your body get back to a normal metabolism. But you should not use the eating period as an excuse to eat too much.</p>
            <p>During "light fasting" eating times, you cannot just eat whatever you want. Dr. Chen explained that after fasting, your stomach is empty. If you eat a lot of sugar or starchy foods at first, your blood sugar will go up and down very quickly, like a roller coaster. This can make you eat too much and gain back weight. Over time, it can also lead to insulin problems and heart disease risks.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen suggests following 4 main rules for eating during "light fasting." First, "eat mostly whole foods." This means eating vegetables, lean meat, fish, eggs, tofu, or low GI (glycemic index) starchy foods like sweet potatoes and brown rice. Try to avoid processed foods, sugary foods, and fried foods. Second, "eat balanced meals." This means having 2 parts vegetables, 1 part protein, and 1 part whole grain starch.</p>
            <p>Third, "control portion sizes." Dr. Chen says that even if your eating time is shorter, it is best to eat 2 to 3 meals and stop when you are 80% full. Do not try to eat a lot because you fasted. Fourth, "think about the order of eating." He suggests drinking water first, then eating protein (like meat) and vegetables. Eat starches and fruits last. Eating in this order can help slow down the rise in blood sugar and keep you feeling full.</p>
            <p>Light fasting after a big meal can help your body's metabolism. However, not everyone should try it. Dr. Chen lists pregnant women, teenagers, people who have trouble controlling their blood sugar for a long time, or people taking medicine for blood sugar. He does not recommend any kind of fasting for these groups.</p>
            <p>If you feel dizzy, your heart beats fast, you eat too much, or your period changes or you lose muscle because of too much fasting, it means your body is under too much stress. You should ask a doctor or a nutritionist for help early. Dr. Chen says that instead of just trying to eat less, it is more important to eat correctly and consistently. This is the key to staying healthy and controlling your weight in the long run.</p>

            <h1>Navy's "Hai Qiang Exercise" Begins Tomorrow; Coast Guard to Join for Wartime Readiness Check</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense will hold three important military exercises for the army, navy, and air force in October. One of them is the Navy's "Hai Qiang Exercise," which will happen from tomorrow until October 17 in the waters around Taiwan. This exercise will include joint interception, putting out fires on ships, forming tactical groups, getting supplies from the air, and some live-fire shooting. It is important to note that the Coast Guard will also join the Navy's command during this exercise. They will practice switching from normal operations to wartime operations, but they will not do any live shooting.</p>
            <p>In recent years, China has often used both words and military actions to threaten Taiwan. Chinese planes and ships have entered the areas around Taiwan's air and sea, often crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait. They have also held military drills in nearby areas, which has greatly affected peace and stability in the region. Taiwan's military is building more weapons itself and buying them from other countries. It is also making its training stronger and changing its systems to be ready for possible threats.</p>
            <p>The military has planned three big exercises for October. These include the Army's "Lu Sheng No. 1" exercise, which used to have a different name. It will take place from October 25 to 31. The Air Force's "Tian Long Exercise" will be from October 27 to 31. And the Navy's "Hai Qiang Exercise" will start tomorrow and last until October 17.</p>
            <p>The "Hai Qiang Exercise" is like a big yearly test. It will include things like working together to stop enemies, fighting fires on ships, controlling damage after a fight, making groups of ships for battle, getting supplies from the air, and some live-fire shooting. It is important to know that the Coast Guard Administration is also a key force during wartime. So, in this exercise, Coast Guard ships will work with the Navy. They will practice how to change from normal duty to wartime duty. However, they will not shoot live ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Navy has sent notices to the Fisheries Agency and the Maritime and Port Bureau about shooting exercises. These notices show that from October 1 to 31, the Navy will choose 3 to 5 daytime periods each week to conduct live-fire shooting from ships and planes. These exercises will happen in 4 different areas around Taiwan. These areas are south of Penghu, northeast of Keelung, west of Kaohsiung's Zuoying, and northwest of Penghu. The highest point the ammunition will reach is between 1,000 feet and 25,000 feet.</p>
            <p>The shooting notice also mentioned that the Navy will carry out a "special exercise" tomorrow from 10 AM to 4 PM. This will be in the waters west of Kaohsiung and Pingtung. They will mark off an airspace for the exercise. One P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and one S-70C anti-submarine helicopter will fly below 4,000 feet and 1,000 feet respectively. They will practice anti-submarine drills. This is expected to be one part of the "Hai Qiang Exercise."</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard's Anping-class 600-ton patrol ships are based on the Navy's Tuo Chiang-class corvette design. Besides Zhenhai rockets, they also have space and pipes for Hsiung Feng missiles. During wartime, the Navy can equip these ships for combat missions, allowing them to switch between normal and wartime roles. During wartime, the Navy will command them by law. The Coast Guard and Navy have also made plans and training methods together. In 2022, they already fired Hsiung Feng II missiles, hitting their targets.</p>
