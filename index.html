            <h1>China's Trade Representative Li Cheng-gang to Visit Washington; US Calls It Informal Talks</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that China's trade representative, Li Cheng-gang, will go to Washington this week. He will talk about trade with Jamieson Greer from the US Trade Representative's office and officials from the Treasury Department. A US government spokesperson confirmed this. However, the spokesperson said that Li Cheng-gang might meet with lower-level US officials, and this visit is not part of formal talks.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported on August 25 that Li Cheng-gang, who is China's trade representative and Vice Minister of Commerce, will go to Washington this week. He will meet with Jamieson Greer from the US Trade Representative's office and officials from the Treasury Department. This will be their first meeting in the US capital. Both sides want to talk regularly during a time when they have stopped increasing tariffs. Li Cheng-gang will also meet with US business leaders.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported on August 26 that a US government spokesperson confirmed Li Cheng-gang's visit to Washington this week. He might meet with US government officials at the deputy ministerial level. But the spokesperson added that this visit is not a formal negotiation meeting.</p>
            <p>Sources said that there is no meeting planned between Li Cheng-gang and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Also, Li Cheng-gang is not coming because the US asked him to.</p>
            <p>On August 11, the US and China agreed to stop increasing tariffs for another 90 days. The US charges a 30% tax on goods from China, and China charges a 10% tax on goods from the US.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal noted that the Trump government has recently become less strict with Beijing. It wants to reach an economic agreement with China. Both sides agreed to stop raising tariffs and to relax some rules on important goods being sent out. This includes rare earth magnets from China and some technology products from the US.</p>
            <p>However, trade problems between the US and China continue. Earlier in August, US President Donald Trump asked China to buy much more US soybeans. But China has not agreed to this yet. At the same time, the US government is getting ready to check imports of steel, copper, and lithium from China more carefully. This is to stop goods from Xinjiang made with forced labor from coming into the US. It also helps to reduce the trade imbalance where the US buys more from China.</p>
            <p>During the talks this week, Li Cheng-gang is expected to talk about buying soybeans.</p>
            <p>However, Reuters, quoting sources, said that the timing of this visit is difficult. This is because China's ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, recently said harsh things about Trump's trade policies. He said that the Trump government stopping Chinese citizens from buying farmland is "political manipulation."</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal, quoting people who know about the situation, said that Beijing will keep asking the Trump government to remove the 20% tariff on fentanyl-related goods. This is before China promises to buy things like soybeans or Boeing airplanes.</p>

            <h1>9 New Cases of Melioidosis, Including 1 Death; 6 New Cases of Leptospirosis</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced today that from August 19 to 25, there were 9 new local cases of melioidosis. One person died 10 days after getting sick because of pneumonia and serious breathing problems. Also, there were 6 new local cases of leptospirosis. One person is still in intensive care.</p>
            <p>Tseng Shu-hui, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Welfare's CDC, said in a regular report today that from August 19 to 25, there were 9 new local cases of melioidosis, and 1 of them died. One case was in the north, and eight cases were in the south. The patients were between 40 and 90 years old. Many of them had long-term health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic kidney disease. They started feeling sick between late June and mid-August. This year, there have been 50 local cases of melioidosis, with 5 deaths. This is the third highest number for this time of year.</p>
            <p>Regarding the death, epidemic prevention doctor Lin Yong-ching explained that it was a man in his 50s from the south. He had several long-term illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic kidney disease. In mid-August, he started coughing. In late August, he also had diarrhea and a runny nose. He went to a clinic twice and was told he had diarrhea and a common cold.</p>
            <p>Lin Yong-ching said that later, he went to the emergency room because of a fever and difficulty breathing. Doctors found his blood oxygen was low. Blood tests showed more white blood cells and signs of inflammation. He was put on a breathing machine and given antibiotics. However, his pneumonia got worse, and he sadly passed away the next day. The cause of death was pneumonia with acute respiratory failure. Later, tests of his blood showed the bacteria that causes melioidosis.</p>
            <p>Lin Yong-ching noted that the investigation found the man had a wound on his foot. But he did not go out during the typhoon, and there was no flooding near his home. So, it is not clear if he touched dirty water or mud. However, because his symptoms were mainly related to his lungs, he might have breathed in the bacteria that caused the infection.</p>
            <p>Last week, there were also 6 new local cases of leptospirosis. Tseng Shu-hui said that one case was in the north, one in the middle, and four in the south. The patients were between 20 and 70 years old. They started feeling sick between late July and mid-August. Most of them went to the doctor because of fever, muscle pain, or diarrhea. This year, there have been 34 local cases of leptospirosis, which is lower than the average for the past five years.</p>
            <p>Kuo Hung-wei, the director of the CDC's Epidemic Command Center, explained that after investigating, they found that four of the cases worked in forests or vegetable gardens. One person lived near stray animals. Also, four of the cases had contact with dirty water or mud. Five of the patients have left the hospital after treatment. One patient is still in intensive care. People living with them and their colleagues do not have similar symptoms. Health authorities have given them information about staying healthy.</p>
            <p>Regarding the patient in intensive care, Lin Yong-ching explained that it is a woman in her 60s from the south. She has a history of high blood pressure. In early August, she started having diarrhea and feeling tired. She went to a clinic and was told she had stomach flu. Because her fever and weakness continued, she went to the emergency room. Her awareness got worse, so she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Doctors reported that she had leptospirosis and other infectious diseases. The investigation found that she had contact with dirty water and mud. She is currently on a breathing machine in intensive care.</p>

            <p>Premier Cho said that this special budget is for NT$60 billion.
