            <h1>Superman Doctor Hsu Chao-pin Dies; Indigenous Peoples Council Gives Posthumous Award</h1>
            <p>The "Superman Doctor" from Taitung's Southern Link region, Hsu Chao-pin, recently passed away. The Council of Indigenous Peoples today gave him a second-class indigenous peoples medal. They also gave money to his family. They hope that Dr. Hsu's good example will encourage more young people to work in healthcare in indigenous areas.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chao-pin had cancer for many years. But he kept visiting patients in Taitung's Southern Link area. He passed away on September 18 this year, at 58 years old.</p>
            <p>The chairperson of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, Icyangâ€§Parod (æ›¾æ™ºå‹‡), went to the Tzuban tribe in Daren Township, Taitung County today. He gave Dr. Hsu the second-class indigenous peoples medal. He also gave money to his family. This was to honor Dr. Hsu, who was called "Taiwan's Albert Schweitzer," for his great work in healthcare for indigenous peoples.</p>
            <p>The Council of Indigenous Peoples said that Hsu Chao-pin spent his whole life helping indigenous tribes with their health and well-being. His hard work and good example are worth learning from. Giving him the second-class indigenous peoples medal shows care for his family. It also hopes his spirit will make more young people want to work in healthcare in indigenous areas, so that everyone can have fair healthcare.</p>
            <p>The Council of Indigenous Peoples said they will keep looking at how medical resources are shared in indigenous areas. They will also actively make new plans to make sure everyone has equal health. This will help Dr. Hsu's ideas and spirit live on forever.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Kajsa Damages 35 Schools; Ministry of Education Gives NT$18.5 Million for Repairs</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education has new information. Typhoon Kajsa damaged 35 schools. The total cost to fix them is about NT$64.14 million. Many schools in Guangfu Township, Hualien County, were badly damaged because of a mudslide from Mataian River. The Ministry of Education has given NT$18.5 million to help fix these schools.</p>
            <p>Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao went to the damaged areas in Hualien and Taitung today to check on students and teachers. The Ministry of Education posted on Facebook this evening that Cheng Ying-yao promised to help children return to safe schools quickly. They are giving NT$18.5 million to help Guangfu Vocational High School, Guangfu Junior High School, and other elementary and middle schools in Hualien County and Taitung County fix their campuses.</p>
            <p>To make sure students can keep learning after the disaster, schools have prepared plans for continuous learning. They will use online learning and other ways during this time.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of Education's School Safety Center, as of 8 AM today, 35 schools were damaged. 15 schools were in Taitung County and 7 were in Hualien County. Hualien County had the most damage, costing NT$60.53 million. Guangfu Junior High School alone suffered great damage from flooding. Kitchen equipment, pipes and wires, other facilities, a school bus, the soccer field, and the track were all badly hurt. The school thinks the damage is NT$60 million.</p>
            <p>However, the Ministry of Education said that Guangfu Township in Hualien is currently closed. Many schools are full of mud. School staff cannot get in or report the damage online. So, they need to check the damage later.</p>

            <h1>US Expands Tariff Investigation to Medical Supplies, Robots, and Industrial Machines</h1>
            <p>The US government has started to investigate robots, factory machines, and medical products. This investigation is about national security. It might lead to new taxes on these goods. This could make things more expensive for shoppers, hospitals, and factories.</p>
            <p>The Commerce Department said yesterday that they started an investigation on September 2. This is based on Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act. They are checking if importing these goods is a danger to US national security. This information is in the US Federal Register.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a financial news company, reported that this investigation now includes more items that might get higher taxes. These include personal protective gear like surgical masks, N95 masks, and medical gloves. It also includes other medical items like syringes, needles, and prescription medicines.</p>
            <p>The investigation also covers imported medical equipment. This includes wheelchairs, hospital beds, pacemakers, insulin pumps, and artificial heart valves.</p>
            <p>These investigations might be used to put more taxes on certain products. The goal is to bring the making of important things for national security back to the US.</p>
            <p>The Commerce Department is asking companies for their thoughts. This includes what they think they will need in the future, if US factories can make enough, and how foreign suppliers are involved. Companies are also asked to explain how foreign subsidies and what the government calls "unfair trade practices" affect their industry.</p>
            <p>Before this, the government of former US President Donald Trump used Section 232 to put more taxes on imported cars, car parts, copper, steel, and aluminum. Investigations on imported medicines, computer chips, and parts for making chips, like silicon wafers and chip-making machines, are still happening. This shows that the US is worried about relying too much on foreign supplies.</p>
            <p>Data from the US International Trade Commission (USITC) shows that the US buys a lot of machines from Mexico and China. In 2023, imports from Mexico were more than 18% of all machines bought, and from China, it was more than 17%.</p>
            <p>The International Federation of Robotics says that the car industry might be one of the most affected by these new taxes. Last year, the car industry installed 13,747 factory robots, which was the most of any industry. The group says that most robots are imported. Only a few are made in the US.</p>
            <p>Experts warn that if there are more taxes on medical equipment and protective items, costs will go up for both hospitals and patients. This could make it harder to get important equipment and medical care.</p>
