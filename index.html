The cost of living increase in the UK, known as inflation, has dropped to 2.3% in April. This is the lowest it has been in nearly three years, since July 2021. This number is very close to the Bank of Englandâ€™s target of 2%.

A main reason for this fall is that energy bills have become cheaper for homes. Also, the speed at which food prices are rising has slowed down. However, prices for services, like restaurant meals or haircuts, are still going up quite fast, at 5.9%. This higher rate for services might mean that the Bank of England will not cut interest rates very soon.

Even though inflation is lower, many people, especially those paying rent or a mortgage, still find things expensive. On a more positive note, wages for some people are now increasing faster than prices, which means they have more money to spend.

**How AI Is Changing the World of Work**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how we work. Many people worry that AI might take away jobs, but it also creates new types of work. Experts say that skills like solving problems, thinking critically, being creative, and understanding emotions will become even more important. These are "human skills" that AI cannot easily do.

AI tools can help people do their jobs better and faster. This can make companies more productive. Instead of replacing human workers completely, AI might work alongside them. For example, in jobs like marketing, writing computer code, or helping customers, AI can assist people.

Workers will need to learn new skills to use AI effectively. Many companies are now teaching their employees how to work with AI. The future workplace will likely have a mix of human skills and AI abilities working together.

**Europe's Popular Cities Face Challenges with Too Many Tourists**

Many popular cities in Europe are dealing with a problem called "overtourism." This means too many tourists visit at once, which can cause issues for local residents and the environment. This summer, a record number of visitors are expected in places like Venice, Amsterdam, and Barcelona.

To manage this, some cities are trying new rules. For example, Venice has started charging a small entry fee for day visitors. Other cities are limiting short-term rentals or the number of large cruise ships.

Even with these challenges, tourism is very important for Europe's economy, bringing a lot of money to many countries. People are still very keen to travel, especially after the pandemic. While many popular places are full, some travelers are now looking for quieter, less crowded destinations to have a more local experience. There's a growing interest in travel that is better for the environment and local people, but the demand for well-known spots remains very high.
