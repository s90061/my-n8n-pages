            <h1>Lin Chih-sheng to Retire: Tseng Hao-chu Praises His Strong Will and Discipline</h1>
            <p>Lin Chih-sheng, an older player for the Wei Chuan Dragons in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL), is going to retire soon. Tseng Hao-chu, who was in the same training group as Lin, feels deeply about this. He saw Lin Chih-sheng as a bright future star in high school and amateur baseball. Lin faced problems and big injuries, but these helped him grow. He achieved what he has today because of his strong will and self-discipline.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-sheng, a 43-year-old infielder for the Dragons, will have his retirement ceremony from September 5th to 7th at the Taipei Dome. Tseng Hao-chu, who started in the same training draft, remembers Lin Chih-sheng hitting a big home run against Lim Chang-yong in the 2006 Asia Series. "That home run was very far, it was a memorable experience," he said. He also remembers Lin's game-winning hit at the Doha Asian Games.</p>
            <p>Tseng Hao-chu said that Lin Chih-sheng has many great records in his career, and each one is special. He has many memories of Lin both on and off the field. When they were teammates, they often got together for barbecues on holidays. Thinking about the past makes him feel a lot. He said that everyone reaches an age when they must retire. Lin's journey has been very hard. Tseng wishes Lin a smooth new start in retirement and hopes he can do what he truly wants.</p>
            <p>Tseng Hao-chu also said that Lin Chih-sheng was a top player and a superstar since high school and his amateur days. Everyone believed he would do great things in the future. Along the way, he faced many challenges, failures, and even injuries from a car accident. But these things helped him grow and gave him experience, making him stronger.</p>
            <p>Tseng Hao-chu said that many people might become sad or unable to play again after going through what Lin Chih-sheng did. However, Lin Chih-sheng used his strong will and self-discipline to return to the field. He kept playing until now, setting many amazing records, which is very impressive.</p>

            <h1>Only One Home Hope Left in Men's Singles: Fritz Easily Wins to Enter US Open Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>New York, August 31 (Central News Agency) â€“ America's top tennis player, Taylor Fritz, easily beat Czech player Tomas Machac in three sets today. He moved strongly into the quarterfinals of the US Open men's singles.</p>
            <p>Fritz was last year's runner-up. This year, after the third round, he is the only American men's singles player left in the US Open.</p>
            <p>Today, Fritz gave the 21st seed Machac almost no chances. He won the match in only 1 hour and 38 minutes with scores of 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.</p>
            <p>After Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul, and Frances Tiafoe lost in the third round, all hopes for an American man to win a Grand Slam title for the first time in 23 years now rest on Fritz.</p>
            <p>The last time an American man won a Grand Slam was Andy Roddick in 2003.</p>
            <p>Fritz said, "I hope the crowd will truly support me now, because I am the last one left."</p>
            <p>"Honestly, it's quite surprising. I think the men's players didn't have a very good week. Shelton was struggling with an injury. Tiafoe and Paul played against very tough opponents who had great skills, so that's how it went."</p>
            <p>"I am very happy to be here, and as I said, if the crowd supports me, we really have a chance."</p>
            <p>Fritz has reached the US Open men's singles quarterfinals for the third year in a row. Last year, he made it to the finals. But this year, as the 4th seed, it might not be as easy for him to do as well.</p>
            <p>Fritz will play against Novak Djokovic on September 2nd. He has lost all 10 times he has played against Djokovic in the past.</p>
            <p>Fritz said, "I think in the first 7 or 8 matches, I probably wasn't good enough and didn't have many chances. But in the last two matches, I feel like my level has improved, and I can compete with him now."</p>

            <h1>Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Estimates High Risk of Bird Flu This Autumn and Winter, Starts Stronger Prevention Measures</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 1 (Central News Agency) â€“ The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) announced that it expects a high risk of bird flu this autumn and winter. Starting today until March of next year, BAPHIQ will work with local governments to carry out stronger prevention measures. It also asks businesses to report any problems to animal disease control agencies. If they do not report, they could be fined up to NT$1 million.</p>
            <p>The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture released a press statement today. It said that the risk of H5N1 bird flu this autumn and winter is still high. To lower the risk of the disease happening and spreading, BAPHIQ will continue to work with local governments to carry out "Stronger Autumn and Winter Bird Flu Prevention Measures" from today until March 31 of next year.</p>
            <p>BAPHIQ explained that bird flu mainly spreads when wild birds carry the virus as they migrate across borders. Taiwan is on a bird migration path. From November to March each year is the main season when wintering migratory birds arrive in Taiwan. This is also when highly pathogenic bird flu often happens.</p>
            <p>BAPHIQ reminded people that September and October are for preparing for stronger prevention measures. It asks poultry farmers to check and get ready their stored disease prevention supplies. They should also finish training for animal disease control staff and keep an eye on the number of migratory (wild) birds, giving warnings when needed. For farms at high risk, such as those that have had repeated outbreaks in the past 5 years or are large enough to be registered but haven't been, BAPHIQ will check their safety and offer training for farmers on safety.</p>
            <p>BAPHIQ stated that the peak period for the disease is from the end of October until March of next year. During this time, they will increase monitoring (more active checks), mark high-risk areas, clean public areas in bird flu hot spots, and make sure slaughterhouses properly clean and disinfect their areas and vehicles. This is all to stop the disease from starting and spreading.</p>
            <p>BAPHIQ urged businesses to immediately report any problems they find to their local animal disease control agency. This will help them deal with the situation quickly and stop the disease from spreading. If businesses do not report as required by the "Animal Infectious Disease Control Act," they will not receive money for animals that are culled, and they could be fined up to NT$1 million.</p>
