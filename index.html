            <h1>Russia Says Talks with Ukraine Are Hard, Like Past China Talks</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Russia and Ukraine had their third round of talks in Istanbul, Turkey. Russia's main talker, former Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky, said that both sides still disagree a lot about stopping the fighting. He said it is not time for their leaders to meet yet. He used the "Chongqing Talks" between Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek during China's civil war as an example. He said that without clear agreements, a meeting between leaders won't be very helpful.</p>
            <p>Vladimir Medinsky, who is talking for Russia, was the Culture Minister for Russian President Vladimir Putin from 2012 to 2020. He also helped write a history book called "Russian History, 1945 to the 21st Century," which came out in 2023. This was the first Russian history book to talk about the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>After the talks, Medinsky told reporters that Russia and Ukraine still do not agree on the details of a ceasefire. He said that before their leaders meet, they need to agree on important topics. If not, the meeting will just be for show.</p>
            <p>He then used the meeting between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong during China's civil war as an example. He said that leader meetings without good preparation don't work well. He said, "Chiang Kai-shek wanted to meet in person to decide the details. They did meet and took a photo, but this did not end the civil war. Their main problems were not solved, so the fighting continued."</p>
            <p>Medinsky added that even though the Kuomintang (KMT) got strong help from Western countries, they could not win the war, and the Communist Party won. He said, "A leader's meeting is only right if it is well-prepared. This is what we told Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Medinsky was talking about the historical "Chongqing Talks." After Chiang Kai-shek invited Mao Zedong three times in 1945, the Kuomintang and Communist Party started talks in Chongqing on August 29. They talked about a peace plan for 43 days and signed the "Double Ten Agreement" on October 10. But the agreement was not followed, and the civil war started again.</p>
            <p>In this round of talks, Russia and Ukraine discussed a plan they had put forward before. But Russia said that Ukrainian soldiers must leave four areas completely: Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, for a ceasefire to happen. Ukraine, however, insisted that Russian soldiers must leave all Ukrainian land. Their positions are very different, so the talks have not made much progress.</p>
            <p>Rustem Umerov, who leads the Ukrainian team and is the head of the National Security and Defense Council, suggested that the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, the US, and Turkey meet before the end of August to find a way forward.</p>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine had two earlier talks on May 16 and June 2. They did not agree on a ceasefire then. But both sides said they want to keep working together on important human issues, like exchanging prisoners of war and dead bodies, and bringing children back home.</p>
            <p>Recently, US President Donald Trump asked Russia and Ukraine to agree on a ceasefire within 50 days. He also said that if there is no progress, the US will punish Russia's trade partners. The deadline for this is August 31.</p>

            <h1>US Finance Minister's Trip Changes, Korea Talks Delayed</h1>
            <p>This morning, South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance told the media that their "2+2 talks" with the US, planned for July 25, will be postponed. This is because the US Finance Minister, Scott Bessent, has another urgent trip. Both countries will talk again to schedule the meeting as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>The new South Korean Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Koo Yoon-cheol, and the head of trade talks, Yeo Han-koo, were supposed to meet with US Finance Minister Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington D.C. on July 25. These "2+2 talks" were to discuss US tariffs on South Korea.</p>
            <p>Koo Yoon-cheol was planning to leave for the US today. It is said he was at the airport, ready to fly, when he suddenly heard that the talks were delayed.</p>

            <h1>Tesla's Profit Drops 16% in Q2 as Car Sales Fall</h1>
            <p>Today, the big electric car company Tesla said its profit for the last three months fell again. This is because there is more competition in the electric car market. Also, some arguments about CEO Elon Musk's involvement in US politics continued, which made car sales go down.</p>
            <p>AFP and Reuters reported that Tesla's profit from April to June (the second quarter) was 1.2 billion US dollars. This is 16% less than the same time last year. In a press release, Tesla said it is still working hard to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and robots.</p>
            <p>Tesla's sales in the second quarter went down to 22.5 billion US dollars, which is less than 25.5 billion US dollars from the same time last year. Experts had expected sales to be 22.74 billion US dollars, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).</p>
            <p>After some changes, Tesla's profit per share in the second quarter was 40 cents. This was less than the 43 cents that experts had expected.</p>
            <p>The drop in profit was expected after Tesla announced fewer car deliveries earlier this month. Also, the average price of cars went down. Plus, money spent on AI and other research projects increased company costs, which also affected the results.</p>
            <p>Tesla did not say how many cars it expects to make this year. They said this is because world trade and money rules keep changing.</p>
            <p>Tesla said, "We are investing carefully, which will help our car and energy businesses grow. But the actual results will depend on many things. These include the world economy, how fast self-driving technology grows, and how much our factories can produce."</p>
            <p>Tesla announced its worst drop in quarterly sales in over 10 years, and its profit was less than what Wall Street expected. However, the profit from making cars was better than what people had worried about. After the market closed, Tesla's stock price dropped by 2.6%.</p>
            <p>Tesla said it expects to start making cheaper cars in large numbers in the second half of this year. This news gives hope to the market. People hope it will increase demand again because of strong competition from low-cost electric cars, especially in markets like China. It also aims to ease the strong negative feelings caused by Elon Musk's far-right political views.</p>
