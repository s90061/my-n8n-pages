            <h1>Company Linked to Radio Taiwan International Hack Also Won City Contracts; Council Member Worries About Sensitive City Data Leak</h1>
            <p>The website of Radio Taiwan International (RTI) was hacked. Its main page was changed to show a five-star flag. A city council member in Taipei found out that the company involved in the hack had also won contracts from the city government. Today, Council Member Yen Jo-fang said that the company's owners used to have companies in China. She is worried that sensitive city data might have been leaked. She asked the city government to provide a report on how to stop sensitive data from leaking.</p>
            <p>An official from Taipei City's Department of Information Technology said in the council meeting that they will check this matter.</p>
            <p>Council Member Yen Jo-fang of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spoke at a regular meeting of the Public Works Department in the afternoon. She said that another council member mentioned yesterday in a committee meeting that the company linked to the RTI case had won contracts to update or maintain websites or databases for Taipei City's Building Administration Office and Department of Cultural Affairs.</p>
            <p>Ms. Yen said that after checking the information, they found that this company had won 5 contracts from Taipei City in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2023. The Department of Cultural Affairs and the Building Administration Office also had over 1200 contracts that met the conditions. The company in question is a certain technology company.</p>
            <p>She stated that public information shows this company has only two shareholders, one as the person in charge and one as a director. However, both of them had opened technology companies in China before. Also, a director of this company once started a "Cross-Strait Youth Alliance." The purpose of this alliance might be to spread propaganda for unification with China.</p>
            <p>Council Member Yen Jo-fang said that the company involved in the RTI case had previously worked on official websites for both the central and local governments. She believes there might be security risks. She asked the Taipei City Department of Information Technology to check all contracts this company got from the city government. The city government should provide a report on how to stop sensitive data from leaking and create a system to prevent such risks in future contracts.</p>
            <p>Yu Chi-hsueh, the head of the Taipei City Building Administration Office, replied in the council meeting. He said that after checking records, they found that this company had won a contract to maintain the Building Administration Office's official website. Regarding other contracts, they will ask another IT company to compare data. He also said that this company used to maintain the official website, but since the warranty period is over, the Building Administration Office now maintains it themselves.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Council Member Hung Wan-chen of the DPP asked in a committee meeting about the RTI website's homepage being hacked and replaced with a five-star flag. She mentioned that the company involved had won contracts to update or maintain websites or databases for Taipei City's Building Administration Office and Department of Cultural Affairs. At that time, Director Chao Shih-lung of the Department of Information Technology said they would provide a report on their findings within two weeks.</p>

            <h1>US Dollar Falls, New Taiwan Dollar Drops Slightly to 30.686 Amid Fluctuations</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 17th â€“ A US Federal Reserve official suggested that they might lower interest rates by a small amount in October. Because of this news, the US dollar index went down. Some Asian currencies went up, while others went down. The New Taiwan dollar moved up and down during the day. This happened because the US dollar was weak, but also because some foreign money was leaving Taiwan. In the end, the New Taiwan dollar closed at 30.686, a small drop of 0.021 NTD. It has now fallen for two days in a row. The total amount of money traded in the Taipei and Yuanta foreign exchange markets was 1.7875 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>After Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve, showed a softer stance on money policy, another Federal Reserve official, Christopher Waller, also hinted that he supports lowering interest rates by 0.25% in October.</p>
            <p>The clear message from the Federal Reserve that they might lower interest rates made people expect it more. This affected how different currencies traded around the world. According to the Central Bank, the US dollar index fell by 0.47% today. Asian currencies had mixed results: the Chinese Yuan dropped a tiny bit by 0.02%, the New Taiwan dollar went down by 0.07%, the Korean Won fell a lot by 0.41%, but the Japanese Yen rose strongly by 1.03%.</p>
            <p>Today, the New Taiwan dollar started trading at 30.64 against the US dollar. It went up because the US dollar was weaker. However, the Taiwan stock market pulled back after rising a lot. Foreign investors used this chance to take their profits and send money out of Taiwan. This made the New Taiwan dollar's value go up and down. During the day, it was highest at 30.62 and lowest at 30.692. The Central Bank made small adjustments at the end of the day, and the currency closed with a small drop.</p>
            <p>Foreign exchange traders said that the topic of AI is still very popular, and the Taiwan stock market has been rising little by little, setting new records often. But people are worried about a market bubble. Many investors are selling their stocks when prices are high to make a profit. Today, foreign investors sold a lot more Taiwan stocks and moved their money out through the foreign exchange market. Also, companies that export goods think the New Taiwan dollar will get weaker, so they are not in a hurry to exchange their foreign money. This means the New Taiwan dollar does not have much support.</p>
            <p>The New Taiwan dollar also ended the week lower today. It has dropped by 0.141 NTD or 0.46% this week, making it two weeks in a row that it has fallen.</p>
            <p>Foreign exchange traders believe that Federal Reserve officials have been hinting about lower interest rates one after another. The market has already reacted to these expectations. From now on, unless the expectation of interest rate cuts increases to 0.50%, there will not be much more effect on the foreign exchange market. In the short term, foreign investors will still be the main factor that controls the New Taiwan dollar's value.</p>
            <p>Foreign exchange traders also pointed out that an American bank has shown problems with its loans. We need to see if this is just one problem or if it will cause more problems for other banks. If it causes more problems, it could make the US stock market fall, and this would also make Taiwan's stock and currency markets fall. Also, we need to watch how the disagreement over the US government's shutdown develops.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Series: Brothers and Monkeys Fight for Important First Win; Game 1 Pitchers Are L. G. Rodriguez and Marcelo Martinez</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 17th â€“ The Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) Taiwan Series is about to begin. The CTBC Brothers and the Rakuten Monkeys will play for the championship. Both teams want to win the first game, which is very important. For tomorrow's first game, the Brothers will have L. G. Rodriguez as their starting pitcher, and the Monkeys will have Marcelo Martinez. The Brothers' head coach, Keiichi Hirano, said that the Monkeys are a strong opponent, and he expects a great game.</p>
            <p>The CPBL Taiwan Series will start tomorrow. It is a best-of-seven series, meaning the first team to win four games wins the championship. The CTBC Brothers, who won the second half of the season and had the best winning record for the year, will play against the Rakuten Monkeys. The Monkeys had the third-best winning record and worked hard through the playoffs to reach the Taiwan Series. Their first game will be held tomorrow at the Taipei Dome, and it is confirmed that 40,000 people will be there, making it a full stadium.</p>
            <p>According to CPBL information, the team that wins the first game in the Taiwan Series has an 87.5% chance of winning the championship. For the Brothers, if they win the first game, they have an 80% chance to win the championship. For the Monkeys, if they win the first game, they have a 100% chance to win the championship based on their past history. So, both teams really want to win tomorrow's first game.</p>
            <p>The Brothers will have L. G. Rodriguez start the first game. He was the best pitcher in the league this year, with the lowest earned run average. This season, Rodriguez has not lost against the Monkeys. In 5 games he started, he won all 5. He pitched for 31.1 innings, and the Monkeys hit only one home run against him. He gave up 6 runs in total, but only 5 of them were his fault. His earned run average against the Monkeys is 1.44.</p>
            <p>The Monkeys will have Marcelo Martinez start the first game. This season, Martinez has started 4 games against the Brothers. He has 1 win and 3 losses. He pitched for 24 innings, gave up 15 runs in total, and 12 of them were his fault. His earned run average against the Brothers is 4.50.</p>
            <p>Brothers' head coach Keiichi Hirano said that he has always thought the Monkeys are a very strong team. This year, they had the third-best winning record and played in the playoff challenge series first. He said it is great that they overcame the rules that were not in their favor and made it to the Taiwan Series. This also makes fans excited because it shows that a team with the third-best winning record can still win the championship. He believes that the championship series between the team with the best winning record (Brothers) and the team with the third-best winning record (Monkeys) will be a very exciting game.</p>
            <p>Keiichi Hirano also mentioned that the Brothers win games by working together as a team. Everyone has their own role. The 32 players chosen for the Taiwan Series are the ones the coaching staff believes are the best players for now.</p>
