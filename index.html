            <h1>Hau Lung-pin: If I become Party Chairman, I will take legal action to get justice from the Ill-gotten Party Assets Committee</h1>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin is a candidate for the Kuomintang (KMT) Party Chairman. Today, he said that if he is elected Chairman, he will take legal action. He wants to get justice because of the unfair actions of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.</p>
            <p>He also promised that if he gets the party assets back, he will first pay all the retirement money owed to former party workers. He will then donate any remaining party assets to help others.</p>
            <p>The KMT Party Chairman election will happen on October 18. Six people have signed up to run for Chairman. They include former lawmaker Cheng Li-wen, KMT lawmaker Lo Chih-chiang, former Changhua County Commissioner Cho Po-yuan, former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin, former National Assembly member Tsai Chih-hung, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen School president Chang Ya-chung.</p>
            <p>Today, Hau Lung-pin wrote on Facebook that since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power, they asked political parties and the military to leave the media. The KMT followed this rule, but the DPP has taken control of the media. The DPP has also gone after the KMT's assets. But the DPP itself has many cases of corruption and bad deals between officials and businesses. He said this shows "green can, you cannot," meaning the DPP can do things it stops others from doing.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin said that this morning, he talked with party members in Kaohsiung's Guomao Community. He felt sad that KMT workers who retired only received 40% of their retirement money. He believes the party has truly let them down. So, he promised that if he becomes Chairman, he will take legal action against the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee's unfair actions. He also said that if party assets are returned, he will first pay all the owed retirement money to party workers. Then, he will donate all other party assets to charity.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin believes the KMT has courage. He said that when the 72 martyrs started the Huanghuagang Uprising, they had no money. They did not start with money; they gained support through the party's spirit and beliefs.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin also said that he felt very welcome when he visited the Guomao Community today. He shook hands with every party member there to say hello. He said that their parents and older relatives worked hard to protect the Republic of China. He added that they all grew up with ration cards and are the most true supporters of the Republic of China.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin told everyone that he has been the Mayor of Taipei and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA). When he was the EPA Administrator, he successfully cleaned up the Gaoping River. At that time, there were 620,000 pigs and over 1,000 pig farms upstream. To ensure Kaohsiung people had good drinking water, he acted with strength. Within one year, all pig farms were moved away. This stopped the bad smell in Kaohsiung's water. He said this shows his ability to get things done and his leadership.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin stressed that the party chairman election is not a speech contest. It is not about who can talk best, but who can do best. He said he is a person who always does what he says.</p>

            <h1>Is the Era of AI Actors Coming? Hollywood has Questions</h1>
            <p>Eline Van der Velden is an actress, comedian, and producer from the Netherlands. At a film event in Zurich, she said that an AI actress named Tilly Norwood has gotten attention from many talent agencies. This news has started a big discussion in Hollywood.</p>
            <p>Variety, an American entertainment magazine, reported that Eline Van der Velden, who started the AI production company Particle6, recently opened a new AI talent studio called Xicoia. Tilly Norwood is the first character from this new studio.</p>
            <p>She said her studio is quietly working on some AI projects and will share more news in the coming months.</p>
            <p>Eline Van der Velden said today in an interview, "In February, we had many meetings, and everyone said, 'No, this is nothing. This will not happen.' But by May, people started to say, 'We need to work with you.'"</p>
            <p>She explained that the movie industry's opinion on AI is changing very quickly. "When we first introduced Tilly, people asked, 'What is that?' But now, we will announce in the next few months which talent agency will sign her."</p>
            <p>In July, Tilly Norwood shared on Facebook that she had her first acting job in a short comedy film called "AI Commissioner."</p>
            <p>Tilly Norwood wrote, "I can't believe it... my first acting role is out! I am in 'AI Commissioner,' a new comedy short film made by the Particle6 team. It humorously looks at the future of TV show development."</p>
            <p>She added, "Even though I am made by AI, I feel very real emotions now. I am very excited about what will happen next!"</p>
            <p>Eline Van der Velden said, "We want Tilly Norwood to become the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman. This is our goal." She also pointed out that money is a big reason why the film and TV industry is moving towards AI production.</p>
            <p>She continued, "People are starting to realize that creativity does not have to be limited by money. There are no limits when you create, and this is the good effect of AI. The main point is to change how people see things."</p>
            <p>Eline Van der Velden wrote on LinkedIn, "Audiences care about the story, not whether the actor is a real person with a heartbeat. Tilly has already attracted talent agencies and fans. The time of virtual actors is not in the future; it is already here."</p>
            <p>The Independent, a newspaper from the UK, reported that after Tilly Norwood appeared, many questions were raised. Many Hollywood stars protested.</p>
            <p>Melissa Barrera, an actress from the musical film "In the Heights," wrote on Instagram, "I hope all actors with these (interested in Tilly) agencies leave them right away. It's disgusting."</p>
            <p>Mara Wilson, an actress from "Matilda," asked why hundreds of real young women's faces are used to create AI actors. She questioned, "Why can't you just hire one of them?"</p>
            <p>American actor Nicholas Alexander Chavez added, "She is not an actress at all. It's a pointless try."</p>
            <p>Other stars responded with humor. For example, Lukas Gage from "The White Lotus" said, "She is such a difficult partner to work with!!!!"</p>
            <p>Lucy Hale, an actress famous for the TV show "Pretty Little Liars," simply responded with one word: "No."</p>

            <h1>Hou Yu-ih: The Zhonghe MRT Line is developing and will extend to Taipei's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih attended a celebration for the Earth God today. During the event, he talked about the progress of two MRT lines in the Zhonghe area. He said the Wanda-Zhonghe line is expected to open in 2027. The Guangfu line is also being planned. When it is finished, people will be able to travel directly from Zhonghe to Taipei's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.</p>
            <p>Today, nine Earth God temples in Zhonghe District, New Taipei City, held a "Earth God Parade and Blessing Festival" together. This event was to pray for peace in the area. The parade went through 36 villages in Zhonghe District. Along the way, people from each village set up altars to welcome the gods. The event had a large group of people, including motorcycle teams, dragon and lion dances, drum groups, traditional music, and decorated floats. More than 2,000 people took part, making it a very lively event.</p>
            <p>Hou Yu-ih said in his speech that Zhonghe has more than 80 Earth God temples. This shows that it is a very important part of the area's religious culture. He said this is not just a traditional religious event but also a display of local culture. He saw that village leaders and residents organized the altars and welcomed guests by themselves, which showed the strength of the community and the warmth of the local people.</p>
            <p>Hou Yu-ih also mentioned that the Wanda-Zhonghe MRT line will open in 2027. The Guangfu line is also being planned. When it is finished, it will go from Zhonghe directly to Taipei's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. These two MRT lines are very important for the Zhonghe area. The city government will also try its best to solve traffic problems in the Huiyao area.</p>
            <p>Hou Yu-ih said that Zhonghe has many different cultures. For example, Hwasing Street has many cultures from other countries, and the president of the Myanmar Chinese Association also came to the event. He hoped that the Earth God would bless all the people living in this area, no matter which country they come from, so that everyone who lives in Zhonghe can be safe.</p>
