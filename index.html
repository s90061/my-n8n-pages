            <h1>Lulu Cries at Golden Bell Awards, Chen Han-Dian Comforts Her: "Just Being There is 100 Points"</h1>
            <p>Lulu, who hosted the Golden Bell Awards and was nominated for "Best Host for a Variety Show," said at a celebration party early this morning that she cried a lot the night before hosting. Chen Han-Dian kindly told her, "You get 100 points just by being there." She also said that her ex-boyfriend, Ada, wrote the rap she performed at the beginning of the show.</p>
            <p>Lulu hosted the 60th Golden Bell Awards for TV shows. During the ceremony, her interactions with her ex-boyfriend Ada and her husband Chen Han-Dian were very funny. Early this morning, Lulu went to celebration parties for "Night Market King" and "Hot Door Night." Lulu admitted that hosting the 60th Golden Bell Awards was very stressful. The night before, she cried a lot to let out her feelings. Chen Han-Dian kindly comforted her, saying, "You are either 0 or 100. 0 means you don't show up. Otherwise, just being there means you get 100 points!" This made Lulu very happy.</p>
            <p>Last night, Lulu walked the red carpet with Chen Han-Dian and Jacky Wu. Usually, Jacky Wu stands in the middle, but after Lulu and Chen Han-Dian announced they were married, Jacky Wu let her stand in the middle. Even their clothes matched hers. "Jacky Wu said the bride is the most important."</p>
            <p>Lulu also shared a funny story. When they were taking pictures backstage, the photographer actually asked Jacky Wu to move, saying, "Let's take pictures of Lulu and Han-Dian first!" Lulu was very nervous when she heard this, saying, "Don't do that!" But Lulu also said that her show partners are like family and don't care about who is older or newer. She thanked Jacky Wu very much.</p>
            <p>The show "Night Market King" won the Golden Bell Award for "Innovative Program." The hosts, Lulu, Ada, and Beautiful Person, attended the celebration party early this morning. Beautiful Person thanked the judges but also felt sad that they did not win the hosting award. At the ceremony, Ada and Chen Han-Dian sat together. Ada said they were talking about Lo Shi-Feng's performance and revealed that Lo Shi-Feng was very happy when he performed with the girl group, Phantom Blue Bear. "Lo Shi-Feng said the girls from Phantom Blue Bear are so young and smell so good."</p>
            <p>When the award for "Best Host for a Variety Show" was given, Lulu sat between her ex-boyfriend Ada and her current husband Chen Han-Dian. Lulu joked openly that meeting them was destiny. "If one of us three isn't funny, this whole part won't work." This part of the show was very popular.</p>
            <p>Finally, Lulu said that Ada wrote the rap for the opening. "I told my husband about it! And Ada even came to help me with the final rehearsal the day before. He is very good at writing rap, so I asked for his help to make the ceremony more colorful." Lulu also thanked Ada's girlfriend for letting Ada help her.</p>

            <h1>Education Ministry's Cross-Disciplinary Plan Encourages AI in Teaching; 1160 Schools Have Joined</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education held the 2025 Digital Cross-Disciplinary Education Annual Conference in Chiayi today. The Ministry continues to use a plan to encourage elementary and middle schools to add AI (Artificial Intelligence) into their teaching. They also use "project-based learning" to help students explore more. So far, 1160 schools have joined.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education announced today in a press release that the "PBL-STEM+AICT Cross-Disciplinary Integrated Smart Learning Foundation Program" uses information technology as its main focus. It combines subjects like math, physics, chemistry, and natural sciences. Through project-based teaching, students learn to think of ideas, break down problems, analyze patterns, and use logic. This slowly improves their ability to explore and their interest in learning.</p>
            <p>Since 2019, this plan has had 1160 schools as "base schools" and has started 131 small groups.</p>
            <p>At today's annual conference, the focus was on how to use AI in classrooms. Teachers were encouraged to use generative AI and machine learning tools to create teaching materials and lessons. This helps them to teach across different subjects and use new technologies.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education hopes that the annual conference and the teaching material competition will help teachers share ideas and work together. They also hope that these exchanges and observations will lead to new teaching ideas, promoting digital skills and the ability to combine different subjects.</p>

            <h1>NTU President Chen Wen-Chang Wants to Stay for Another Term; University Meeting to Vote on December 13th</h1>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang, the president of National Taiwan University (NTU), officially told the university meeting today that he wants to continue as president. His goal is for NTU to have 9 subjects ranked in the top 50 globally. NTU plans to hold a special university meeting on December 13th to vote on whether Chen Wen-Chang will continue as president.</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang explained at the university meeting today that his first term as president is set to end on January 7, 2027. On September 2, this year, the Ministry of Education sent a letter asking university presidents who want to stay on to submit their requests within one month. So, he already told the administrative meeting in September that he wanted to continue. By the end of September, he sent the documents to the Ministry of Education. Today, he officially told the university meeting that he wants to stay.</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang said he thought about trying for another term for a while. His main reason was whether he could help NTU get even better. He said if he can stay as president, he will continue his idea of "building a world-class university and showing a hundred years of greatness." He will keep working on improving the campus buildings, and finding and keeping good teachers and researchers.</p>
            <p>For academic research, Chen Wen-Chang hopes that by 2030, NTU will have 9 subjects ranked in the top 50 in the world. (Currently, 7 subjects are in the top 50: Classics and Ancient History, Social Policy and Administration, Modern Languages, Sociology, Library and Information Management, History, and Data Science and Artificial Intelligence).</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang also promised to keep trying to raise money. He plans to use strategies like investments and new campus businesses. His goal is for NTU's university fund to reach 100 billion New Taiwan Dollars by 2045.</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang became NTU president on January 8, 2023. Before that, he was the Dean of the College of Engineering and the Director of the Institute of Polymer Science. His research areas include electronic and optoelectronic polymers, polymer nanomaterials, and precise polymer synthesis.</p>
            <p>According to the "Organizational Regulations of National Taiwan University," the president's term is 4 years. A president who wants to stay for another term must tell the university meeting 14 months before their term ends. Then, the Ministry of Education evaluates them. The evaluation report is expected to be given to NTU by the end of November. After that, the university's internal process will begin.</p>
            <p>The president then needs to give a report on their achievements to the university meeting. A special university meeting is expected to be held on December 13th this year to discuss the approval of his continued term. Finally, he needs more than half of the representatives to agree to continue as president.</p>
