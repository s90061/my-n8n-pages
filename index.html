            <h1>Tourist Bus Crash in New York Kills 5, Injures Many; Passengers Include Chinese People</h1>
            <p>(New York, Pembroke, August 22, Central News Agency) Authorities in the United States said that a tourist bus carrying 54 people crashed on the highway. The bus was returning to New York City from Niagara Falls. Five passengers died, and many were hurt. Many of the passengers were from India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the bus seemed to lose control when it was driving on Interstate 90 near Pembroke town. This town is about 40 kilometers east of Buffalo. The bus windows broke, and passengers were thrown out of the bus.</p>
            <p>James O‚ÄôCallaghan, a spokesperson for the New York State Police, said, "Right now, we know that many people have died, many are stuck, and many are injured." He also said that there were children on the bus.</p>
            <p>O‚ÄôCallaghan stated that the bus was going east when it hit a road barrier. It finally stopped in a ditch on the right side of the road. He repeated that many passengers were from India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
            <p>O‚ÄôCallaghan also said, "The driver survived and is not hurt. We are working with him. We think we have a basic idea of what happened and why the bus lost control." However, he did not give more details.</p>
            <p>Mercy Flight, a medical transport service, said that three of its helicopters and three more from other organizations took people from the crash site. Hospitals in the area said they checked or took care of more than 40 people. Patients had injuries like head injuries and broken arms and legs.</p>
            <p>O‚ÄôCallaghan said, "This was a full-sized tourist bus, and it was badly damaged. I guess most of the passengers were not wearing seatbelts. This is why so many people were thrown out of the bus."</p>
            <p>After a bus crash in New York in 2023, New York State law says that charter buses made on or after November 28, 2016, must have seatbelts. It is not yet known how old the bus in today's crash was.</p>

            <h1>North Korea Claims South Korea Fired Warning Shots at Border, Calls It Intentional Provocation</h1>
            <p>(Seoul, August 23, Central News Agency) North Korea's official news agency, KCNA, reported today that North Korea said South Korean soldiers fired warning shots near the border between the two Koreas on August 19. North Korea called this action a planned act to cause trouble.</p>
            <p>North Korea also said that South Korean soldiers are using warning broadcasts more and more in the border area.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that since last year, North Korea has been building fences along the heavily guarded border. At the same time, they have been destroying roads and railways that connect the two Koreas.</p>
            <p>KCNA quoted a statement from Vice Chief of the General Staff Ko Jong Chol. He said that if anything stops the fence-building plan, North Korea will "take action against it." He also said that North Korea will "not be responsible for serious problems" caused by not paying attention to warnings in the border area in the future.</p>
            <p>The message from North Korea is different from what South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said last week. Lee Jae Myung had said that South Korea would stop some military activities at the border. The South Korean government has been working to make relations better between the two Koreas.</p>

            <h1>Vietnam Starts Big "Streamlining Revolution," Cuts 100,000 Government Jobs</h1>
            <p>(Hanoi, August 22, Central News Agency) Vietnam is going through its biggest changes in almost 40 years. To Lam, the head of the Communist Party of Vietnam, is leading a "streamlining revolution." This means cutting down government levels and departments and removing 100,000 public service jobs. Vietnam hopes to use this chance to build a rising nation, and many countries are watching. Experts say that there might be some difficult times and worries about too much power in one place. But if it works, it will make the government better and save money.</p>
            <p>In February this year, Vietnam's Parliament approved a plan to combine cities and provinces. This started the biggest change in government organization in modern Vietnamese history. Experts call it a "streamlining revolution." It is also the most ambitious change since the "Doi Moi" reforms in 1986.</p>
            <p>To Lam became the head of the Communist Party in July last year. He promised to start a "new era of Vietnam's rise." Soon after, many plans for reorganizing and changing things began.</p>
            <p>‚óè Half of Provinces Cut, System Made Simpler: Biggest Reform in 40 Years</p>
            <p>To get ready for this new era, the large and slow government system needs to become active. The goal is to make the government work better and faster. This means simplifying old, complex administrative steps. It also means cutting down the large number of government workers, saving money, and reducing problems caused by too much bureaucracy.</p>
            <p>With To Lam's strong leadership, starting in July, Vietnam's original 63 provinces and cities officially combined into 34. This includes 28 provinces and 6 cities directly controlled by the central government. This cut the number almost in half. The three-level local government system was also made simpler, becoming just two levels: provincial and communal. The old district-level areas were removed.</p>
            <p>Zach Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, told Radio Free Asia (RFA) that after the changes, almost every new province has a coast and ports, except for the northeastern inland provinces. This will help with international trade.</p>
            <p>Over several months, many place names that people had used their whole lives officially disappeared from maps and government documents. This also caused a lot of discussion online.</p>
            <p>Hieu, a resident of Hanoi whose hometown was in Ha Giang province in northern Vietnam, told the Central News Agency that his hometown merged with Tuyen Quang province to form a new Tuyen Quang province. He felt "a bit lost in identity" because his hometown's name disappeared. But at the same time, he thought that making the government levels simpler would make things more efficient. He said, "Even though it's not what I'm used to, in the long run, it's good for the country."</p>
            <p>Besides combining local government levels, simplifying political organizations is also key to To Lam's reform. The number of top-level committees was reduced. Central government departments were reorganized. For example, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Construction merged. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment merged with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Local departments also face complete reorganization.</p>
            <p>‚óè Nearly 100,000 Jobs Cut, Saved Money for Education</p>
            <p>Making the government smaller can increase efficiency. But because of this, almost 100,000 public service jobs were cut. Many government workers either changed jobs, retired, or were fired.</p>
            <p>However, this is also one of the goals of the "streamlining revolution." According to Lianhe Zaobao and other sources, almost 70% of Vietnam's government spending goes to civil servants' salaries. Large government spending, low pay, and low efficiency have been long-standing problems for Vietnam.</p>
            <p>These big changes also led to a new way of managing money. The government will have more money to invest in national development. To Lam sees "education" as a top priority.</p>
            <p>In his speech in May, he admitted that even though the economy is growing fast, there are still challenges. These include "limited labor productivity and ability to innovate" and "the risk of getting stuck in the 'middle-income trap'."</p>
            <p>To use the benefits from its young population and the US-China trade war, Vietnam needs to act quickly. It must improve the quality of its people and change its technology. Also, to change its industries and stop talented people from leaving, training people in artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies is very important.</p>
            <p>In May, the government announced that it would make education free for children from public kindergartens to high school graduation. It will also put about 54 trillion Vietnamese dong (about 62.2 billion New Taiwan dollars) into supporting education reforms and training talented people.</p>
            <p>The "Vietnam AI Academy," started by the Vietnam National Innovation Center (NIC), Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), and the tech giant NVIDIA, opened on August 21. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Chi Dung said in his speech that this model should be copied across Vietnam. This way, students, researchers, businesses, and government workers can all learn about AI.</p>
            <p>‚óè Vietnam at a Turning Point in History: Chances and Challenges of a Rising Era</p>
            <p>Professor Abuza said that Vietnam's young population is now at its largest. Because more people are moving to cities and more educated women are working, the number of new babies will slowly go down. He believes that Vietnam might look at Thailand as a warning, to avoid becoming an old country before it becomes rich.</p>
            <p>Vietnam's economy is growing strongly in 2025. According to data from Vietnam's General Statistics Office, the economy grew by about 7.52% in the first half of this year. In the second quarter, it grew even more, by 7.96%. This is the highest in Southeast Asia, two percentage points higher than the Philippines, which is in second place.</p>
            <p>Abuza said that To Lam's anti-corruption work over the past 10 years has made him popular and powerful within the party. He is using the energy and power from starting his new role to make big changes to the system very quickly.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam will be held in January next year. It is unusual for To Lam to make such big changes now. This shows that "he completely controls the Central Committee, has its full support," and "is very confident about being re-elected next year."</p>
            <p>But Abuza also thinks that To Lam is the right person for these important reforms. "He really understands that Vietnam must use this very short opportunity to make big changes to its economy and reforms."</p>
            <p>Nguyen Khac Giang, a researcher at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, wrote in an article called "Bureaucratic Reform in Vietnam: Opportunities and Challenges in the 'Era of National Rise'" that creating "super-ministries" might lead to too much power in one place. This could make "checks and balances" weaker. Also, there might be more unhappiness within the party because of increased competition.</p>
            <p>He believes that the success of this reform will depend on balancing different things: fast changes and keeping things stable, central control and local energy, cutting jobs and keeping people happy. However, "if the reform is carried out well, it will help Vietnam fight inefficiency and corruption. It will also help the country reach its goal of becoming a high-income economy by 2045."</p>
