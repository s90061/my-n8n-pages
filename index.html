            <h1>Taiwan's Ocean Waste Team Joins Japan's Circular Economy Expo, Minister Encourages Them</h1>
            <p>The Ocean Affairs Council is leading nine companies from Taiwan to Japan's Circular Economy Expo. These companies work with textiles, biotechnology, plastic recycling, and low-carbon design. This is the first time such a group from Taiwan is joining this event. Minister Kuan Pi-ling encouraged the team from overseas. She hopes Taiwan can show the world its new ideas for recycling ocean waste.</p>
            <p>The Circular Economy Expo is one of Japan's most important shows for circular economy. It focuses on recycling, sustainable materials, and new designs that help the environment. Over 500 companies take part. The Ocean Affairs Council said today that the nine Taiwanese companies will be at the expo in Chiba Prefecture from today until September 19. They have a special area called "Taiwan Ocean Circular Hub" to show Taiwan's new ways of recycling ocean waste.</p>
            <p>The night before the expo started, Minister Kuan Pi-ling talked to the team through a video call. She also greeted international partners. She said that Taiwan's ocean partners have already done good things to help make the ocean sustainable. They have also made sustainable ideas a part of everyday life. She said Taiwan is "small but beautiful" and "strong in technology." She stressed that Taiwan wants to show the world how it turns "ocean waste problems" into "new chances for recycling." The Ocean Affairs Council will keep working on the "Indo-Pacific Regional Ocean Waste Cooperation Platform." They will work with Japan and other international partners to create new ways for the ocean circular economy. This will make the ocean a lasting resource for future generations.</p>
            <p>A press release from the Ocean Affairs Council stated that this group has nine companies from different fields. These include textiles, biotechnology, plastic recycling, and low-carbon design. The companies are Far Eastern New Century, Shen Jen Textile, P-Tex, Fullchance Textile, Formosa Taffeta, Yongli Biochemical Technology, Chun Chieh Biotech, Fonyi Green Energy Materials, and Kao Chang Trading (Tsuo Nei Branch). They are showing clothes made from ocean waste fibers and other products made from recycled materials. This is the first time Taiwan is showing its progress in turning "waste" into "sustainable resources" at a big international exhibition in Japan.</p>
            <p>Besides showing new ways to deal with ocean waste and new products, the Ocean Affairs Council will also hold a "Taiwan Circular Economy Focus Sharing Session" and a "Taiwan-Japan Blue Circular Industry Matchmaking Meeting" during the expo. They will invite international experts and Japanese business people to meet and work together. This will help create a blue circular economy supply chain across different countries. This effort moves Taiwan from its local ocean waste recycling group to a bigger network in the Indo-Pacific. It is also an important part of Minister Kuan Pi-ling's plan for international cooperation on ocean issues.</p>

            <h1>Hon Teng: AI Needs Data and Power; New Middle East Factory to Start Construction by Year-End</h1>
            <p>Hon Teng Precision, a company under Hon Hai, held its first technology forum called FIT 2025 Tech Day in Taiwan this afternoon. Hon Teng Chairman Lu Song-ching said that data and power are very important for "AI Mobility."</p>
            <p>Prince Fahad bin Nawaf Al Saud from Saudi Arabia also spoke at Hon Teng's Technology Day event. He spoke as the CEO of Smart Mobility, which is Hon Teng's joint company in Saudi Arabia.</p>
            <p>Hon Teng stated that Smart Mobility officially started in May this year, after signing a joint agreement in October 2024. A ceremony to begin building a new factory will take place by the end of this year. This means Hon Teng will have a new manufacturing base in the Middle East.</p>
            <p>Chairman Lu Song-ching said in his speech that the current rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) helps industries move forward. AI is also making software more important in controlling hardware. People say "Data is the New Oil." But just having oil is not enough. The AI era needs ways to move data and change energy to power the future. Hon Teng's connectors and fast data transfer are like the body's nerves, sending signals and data. The power systems are like blood, giving constant and strong energy for AI's large computing needs.</p>
            <p>He explained that for AI to drive the future, data and power must move very well. With fast, safe, and steady transfer, AI can truly show its value. Hon Teng is a key part of making this happen.</p>
            <p>Lu Song-ching also said that AI is already a big reason for changes in industries. Things like self-driving cars, drones, robots, and even future flying cars are being redefined because of AI. During this change, AI will also redefine mobile devices, data processing devices, and devices that use power very well.</p>
            <p>Lu Song-ching mentioned that Hon Teng created "One Mobility." This includes German brands Autokabel and Voltaira, which Hon Teng bought. One Mobility focuses on strong power and combining systems. It will work with other companies around the world to build a new Mobility system. This will open new market chances and collaborations across different industries.</p>
            <p>To become more competitive and make its brands consistent, Hon Teng recently announced that it will combine its two main car-related businesses under one brand, "One Mobility." This is to create one brand and share resources for better teamwork.</p>
