**U.S. House of Representatives Unanimously Passes "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act", Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

The U.S. House of Representatives on June 23 orally and unanimously passed the bipartisan "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act." This act tells the U.S. to use its influence and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's involvement in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This includes participating in economic oversight, getting technical help, and allowing Taiwanese people to work in the IMF. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) today (June 24) said that this bill is good for supporting Taiwan's broader international participation and for pushing back against China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA will watch how this bill develops closely.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," which asks the U.S. government to help Taiwan join the IMF, was proposed and passed by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in March this year. Then, on June 23, the full House passed it orally without any objections. The bill was put forward jointly by Republican Representative Young Kim and Democratic Representative Al Green.

Representative Kim stated that China continues to block Taiwan's participation in international groups like the IMF because it knows that financial security is as important as military security. China could potentially harm Taiwan's financial system by raising tariffs, selling off stocks, or stopping bank transfers. Joining the IMF would give Taiwan resources to strengthen its financial resilience and resist China's economic pressure.

In response, MOFA Spokesperson Joanne Ou said at a regular press conference this morning that this bill is very important for helping Taiwan expand its international participation and for pushing back against China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA thanked the U.S. House of Representatives for passing this bill without objection. She said it clearly shows the strong support of U.S. congressional members from both parties for Taiwan's involvement in international organizations and its expansion in the international arena. It also further highlights how important it is to make Taiwan's economy stronger and to build global partnerships.

MOFA stated that it will closely monitor the future progress of this bill. It will also maintain close coordination and communication with its friends in the U.S. Congress and the executive branch to keep building positive momentum for Taiwan's international participation.

Regarding this "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," after it passed the U.S. House of Representatives on June 23, an identical version must pass in the U.S. Senate and then be signed by the President to become official law. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee already passed a similar bill in early June, and it is now waiting for a full Senate vote.

**Taiwan is 'of course' a country, president says in rebuke to China**

<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is "of course" a country, and China has no historical or legal proof to support its claims of sovereignty, President Lai Ching-te said on Sunday. This was a strong response to Beijing and its increasing political and military pressure.

China states that democratic Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese land that has belonged to the country since ancient times. It claims the island is one of its provinces and has no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have offered to talk with China many times, but China has refused. China calls Lai a "separatist."

In the first of 10 speeches in a series called "uniting the country," Lai discussed Taiwan's history. He pointed to the long-standing connection of its native people to other Austronesians, like native Hawaiians. This was to show, he said, Taiwan's separate and unique development from China.

Taiwanese people have a history of fighting against invasion, such as uprisings against Japan's colonial rule from 1895-1945. Also, under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for eight years, he added.

"Of course Taiwan is a country," he said at a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, also mentioning its presidential elections. "But China says no, that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of office hours. China says the 1971 United Nations resolution, which removed Taipei's seat and gave it to Beijing, is one of the legal bases for its claims.

Lai, who in March called China a "hostile foreign force," said it was "completely wrong" for Beijing to claim that the U.N. resolution had anything to do with Taiwan's sovereignty. He argued it was only about which government represented China at the UN.

China's threat to Taiwan is real, Lai added, pointing to its daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone agree with this?" he asked, receiving applause.

The defeated Republic of China government moved to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists. This remains the island's official name.
