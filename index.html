            <h1>DPP Office Hit with Eggs by Public; Party to Pursue Legal Action</h1>
            <p>On July 20th, the Taiwan People's Party held a meeting near the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) central office building. During this meeting, some people went into the DPP building. They threw eggs at the main door and the sign of the DPP's central office. The DPP spokesperson, Cho Kuan-ting, said that they have collected evidence and reported it to the police. They will also talk to their lawyers to take legal action. They will not be soft on this matter.</p>
            <p>It was the important Sunday before the vote to remove lawmakers from office. The Kuomintang (KMT) Youth Affairs Department held a "Youth Salon" discussion at their central office this afternoon. At the same time, the Taiwan People's Party held an event called "Democratic Uprising! Win Against Recall, Taiwan Must Win" in front of the DPP central office. Both events were held to support keeping the lawmakers in their positions.</p>
            <p>In the evening, DPP spokesperson Cho Kuan-ting said in an interview that the KMT and Taiwan People's Party are still not understanding. They do not want to admit that they have damaged the constitution and caused problems in the parliament for over a year. He said that these actions, which hurt Taiwan and even support China, are the main reason why people want to remove lawmakers from office. Taiwan is facing many problems, both inside and outside the country. The KMT and Taiwan People's Party, who have most of the seats in parliament, cannot be a good opposition party for the country. Instead, they are stopping Taiwan from moving forward and even causing problems for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting also said that the Taiwan People's Party has ignored the KMT's "mistakes and false claims" during the process of trying to remove DPP lawmakers. For more than a year, they have not acted like the "important small party" they said they would be. He advised both the KMT and Taiwan People's Party to listen to what all citizen groups are asking for. He told them to stop being confused. Creating political conflicts and spreading false information will only make people dislike them more. In the end, people will punish them.</p>
            <p>Also, Cho Kuan-ting stated that after the Taiwan People's Party held an event downstairs from the DPP central office today, some people took the elevator up. They threw eggs at the sign outside the DPP office. The DPP has collected evidence and reported it to the police. They will discuss with their lawyers later to take legal action. They will not be soft on this matter.</p>

            <h1>Korean Group DKB Visits Taiwan, Calls Taichung "Taiwanese Feeling"</h1>
            <p>The K-pop group DKB came to Taiwan for a quick three-day visit to attend an event. They also filmed in Taichung for the event. In Korea, there is a popular phrase called "Taiwanese feeling." One member, Junseo, believes that Taichung represents this "Taiwanese feeling" for him. He said the filming results were very good, and he now really likes Taichung.</p>
            <p>For this trip, five members of DKBâ€”E-CHAN, D1, GK, Junseo, and YUKUâ€”came to Taiwan for the "CRUSH ON YOU POP-UP IN TAIPEI" event. They stayed for three days. For the event, they went to Taichung to film. They also made videos from a "girlfriend's point of view." This lets BBs (the fans of DKB) feel like they are traveling with them and see every special moment.</p>
            <p>Today, the members met with Taiwanese media and shared their ideas about "Taiwanese feeling." Junseo said, "For me, Taichung can represent the 'Taiwanese feeling.' We went to the market and also to a seafood restaurant by the sea. The filming there was very good, and I really fell in love with Taichung."</p>
            <p>E-CHAN thinks that "Taiwanese feeling" is about "youth." He explained, "When Koreans learn about Taiwanese culture, TV shows and movies are often about youth. The theme of our filming this time was also about youth, so the photos and videos turned out beautiful."</p>
            <p>When asked what he would do if he brought his girlfriend to Taiwan, GK said, "First, eat hot pot, mango ice, and bubble tea. Taiwan is the country of bubble tea! Then, go to Taipei 101, eat seafood. Oh, it's so busy! And also ride bikes to help with digestion." But his bandmates joked that he would smell like hot pot all day. So he quickly changed his answer and said, "I'll eat hot pot at night. For the first meal, I'll have beef noodles and fried chicken."</p>

            <h1>Chung Lun Junior High School Team A Wins Allianz Junior World Cup</h1>
            <p>The biggest children's football event in Taiwan, the "2025 Allianz Junior World Cup," held its final matches for different age groups today. In the Under-15 group, Chung Lun Junior High School Team A won the championship. They came back from behind to win 3-1 in a penalty shootout. The goalkeeper, Ho Chien-kai, played a very important role by using both his head and hands to block shots.</p>
            <p>The number of teams joining the competition grew from 1107 last year to 1204 this year. The final matches were held today at the University of Taipei's Tianmu Campus. The winners in each age group were: U6 Little Devil Sea King, U8 Hot-Blooded Strong Ball, U10 TFA Mexico Team, and U12 Football Seeds.</p>
            <p>The last match was for the U15 group, between Chung Lun Junior High School Team A and Beibin Club. Chung Lun started by letting in two goals. They were losing 1-3, but then they scored two goals in a row to make it a tie. This pushed the game into a penalty shootout.</p>
            <p>In the penalty shootout, both teams seemed a bit nervous and often kicked the ball wide. However, Chung Lun's Chen Sheng-en scored first. Then, Liao Kuan-ying and Chiu Yen-hsu also scored. Their goalkeeper, Ho Chien-kai, also blocked two of the opponent's shots with his stomach and face. This helped his team make a huge comeback and win.</p>
            <p>After the game, Ho Chien-kai laughed and said, "It hurt a lot, but I'm very happy. My head felt dizzy when I was hit, but I'm fine now. Everyone fought so hard to get here, so we definitely couldn't give up."</p>
            <p>Ho Chien-kai will go to Ling-Dong High School after the summer break. He started playing football quite late, only in seventh grade. But he is 183 centimeters tall, which is a good height for a goalkeeper. Also, his family fully supports him, and he really likes the sport, which helps him keep going.</p>
            <p>Chung Lun's coach, Chen Jui-te, said they did not prepare specially for the Allianz cup. He said that playing on indoor artificial grass makes the game faster, and passing and running speeds are different from usual. He said, "Luckily, the children did not give up. I give them a perfect score for their performance today."</p>
            <p>The Secretary-General of the Chinese Taipei Mini Football Association, Chang Wu-yeh, said that this year, they are working with Allianz Life to support the "FIFA Football for Schools" program. This program teaches health education and gender equality. They hope to keep using football to improve young people's health and help them develop good social, learning, and teamwork skills.</p>
