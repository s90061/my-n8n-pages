            <h1>OPEC+ Will Produce 547,000 More Barrels of Oil Per Day in September</h1>
            <p>Some countries in OPEC+, which is a group of oil-producing countries, have agreed to make more oil. People think this might make oil and gas prices go down. This is because the world economy is strong, and there is not much oil stored.</p>
            <p>The group had a video meeting today. They announced that eight of their member countries will make 547,000 more barrels of oil every day in September. These countries are Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman.</p>
            <p>These countries had agreed to produce less oil since November 2023. They planned to slowly stop these cuts by September 2026. But today's announcement means they will stop cutting oil production earlier. In July, OPEC+ decided to make 548,000 more barrels of oil per day in August. This new decision follows that one. OPEC said that they might stop or change these production plans if the market changes.</p>

            <h1>After Air Battle with Israel, Iran Starts New Defense Council</h1>
            <p>In June, Iran had a short air battle with Israel. After this, Iran's highest security group has now approved starting a new National Defense Council. This is according to Iran's state media. Reuters reported that the fight with Israel in June was the most serious military problem for Iran since its war with Iraq in the 1980s.</p>
            <p>State media quoted the Supreme National Security Council's office. They said: "This new defense group will check defense plans carefully and make Iran's military stronger." This council will have the leaders of three government departments, high-ranking military leaders, and other related government parts. President Masoud Pezeshkian will lead it. Today, Amir Hatami, who is the head of Iran's military, warned that threats from Israel are still there. He said they should not be thought of as small.</p>
