            <h1>Japanese People in China Face More Dangers; Business Head Asks Them Not to Collect Information</h1>
            <p>Japanese people in China are facing more dangers. The head of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in China, Tetsuro Honma, recently said that if Japanese business people accept tasks from outside groups, provide information, and get paid, this could be seen as a crime under China's "Anti-Espionage Law." This is true no matter what kind of information is collected. He wants Japanese business people to stay away from collecting information.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Chinese website today published an interview with Mr. Honma. He is also the Vice President of Panasonic Holdings.</p>
            <p>Reports say that since China started its "Anti-Espionage Law" in 2014, at least 17 Japanese people have been arrested. Nine of them were caught giving information to Japan's Public Security Intelligence Agency for money. The Chinese government calls these actions spying.</p>
            <p>Mr. Honma said that if these reports are true, it is very sad. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce has asked the Japanese government to state its position on this matter. Some people hope that business people working in China will not be involved in collecting information.</p>
            <p>To handle these dangers, he said that Panasonic has sent out a notice inside the company. It tells employees: "If an outside group asks you to collect information, you must report it immediately." It also tells employees: "As a rule, do not accept such requests." Other companies in the Chamber of Commerce are also taking similar steps.</p>
            <p>In July this year, an employee from Astellas Pharma was sentenced to three and a half years in prison in China for spying. He was also a former vice president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.</p>
            <p>Mr. Honma used this case as an example. He believes that if people do not contact outside groups, do not photograph military places, and do normal business, then "the risk of being held in China is very low."</p>
            <p>But he also said that if people accept tasks from outside groups, like creating or collecting information, and then give the results and get paid, it could be a crime under the Anti-Espionage Law. "It is likely that any type of information collected could be seen as against the law."</p>
            <p>The safety problems for Japanese people in China are not only about spying. Last June in Suzhou, a Japanese mother and child were attacked. The female escort, Hu Youping, was stabbed and died. In September in Shenzhen, a boy studying at a Japanese school there was attacked and died. This July, in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, another Japanese mother with her child was attacked and hurt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Honma said that he has told China, "If the safety of Japanese people in China cannot be guaranteed, then investment in China will not continue."</p>
            <p>He added that it has become a common trend for people working in China to avoid bringing their families, or for families to return to Japan earlier. The number of students in Japanese schools in mainland China has gone down by more than 10% in the last year. The Chinese government also knows this problem well. After the Suzhou incident in July, they have made security stronger at Japanese schools across the country.</p>

            <h1>7.6 Tons of Ruisui Pomelo Enter Singapore Market, First Time Using Single-Fruit Packaging for Luxury Export</h1>
            <p>Hualien's Ruisui Township is one of Taiwan's main areas for growing pomelos. For over 10 years, these pomelos have been sold to other countries. This year, they are also going to Singapore. For the first time, they are selling the pomelos one by one in special packages. Each pomelo is carefully chosen and packed, aiming for a luxury product. Today, 7.6 tons of these pomelos were officially packed and sent out.</p>
            <p>Ruisui Township grows pomelos on about 650 hectares of land. Every year, they produce more than 10,000 tons of pomelos. Huang Sheng-huang, the head of the Ruisui Farmers' Association, said today that they have been selling pomelos abroad for over ten years, mainly to Chinese communities. In the last two years, they have sold about 3,000 tons. These went to places like mainland China, Hong Kong, Canada, and Japan. This year, they are also selling to Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang said that a Singaporean company tried to import the pomelos this year. They will sell them in big supermarkets. Although the amount is only 7.6 tons, the pomelos are being sold in "single-fruit packages." They must be big and beautiful, and meet rules for pesticide use. Each pomelo must be chosen and packed with great care. "Every single one is chosen carefully."</p>
            <p>He said that selling pomelos one by one requires higher quality than selling them in boxes, which was done before. Besides looking good, the pomelos must be sweeter than 11 degrees. The packages have information in both Chinese and English. They show where the fruit comes from, product details, and how to eat it. This is a new challenge for the Farmers' Association.</p>
            <p>Also, this year, Malaysia is a new country for their exports. Mr. Huang said that the order is for about 6 tons, and they will be sold in whole boxes. They are currently planning the shipping date. This will be the last export for this year, and they want to deliver the pomelos before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

            <h1>Kinmen Kaoliang's Contracted Sorghum Farming in Taiwan is Effective; Cooperation Period Extended to 5 Years</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's local farmers' associations and Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. started a program in 2022 to grow sorghum in Taiwan. The first part of this program lasted three years and finished in 2024. The sorghum sold very well. Today, the Ministry of Agriculture said that the second part of the program will now last for five years, from 2025 to 2029.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture released a statement. Before the Ministry of Agriculture was changed, the former Council of Agriculture and the Kinmen County Government helped farmers' associations in Taiwan connect with Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. in 2021. They started growing sorghum in Taiwan in 2022. The first three-year part, from 2022 to 2024, is now done. The program, called "Yi Gu Zuo Qi" (one grain, one contract) for local sorghum, had great sales.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. growing sorghum in Taiwan, which does not need much water, is very important. It helps make sure there is enough sorghum for making liquor. It also reduces the amount of land used for rice, which needs a lot of water. This helps with too much rice and uses water more wisely. Starting from the first harvest in 2024, the price for sorghum bought under the contract went up from NT$21 to NT$25 per kilogram. This gives farmers more money and makes them more willing to grow sorghum.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture said that to meet farmers' hopes, help them invest in machines and tools for growing sorghum, and ensure steady sorghum production, the Kinmen County Government and Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. decided to extend the program. The cooperation will now be for five years, from 2025 to 2029. They will continue to buy sorghum at a contract price of NT$25 per kilogram.</p>
