            <h1>Taiwan's Chien Pei-Yun is 8th after First Round at LPGA Canada Open with 68 strokes</h1>
            <p>On August 22, Taiwan's golf player Chien Pei-Yun played very well in the first round of the LPGA Canada Women's Open. She made 5 birdies and 2 bogeys. She finished with a score of 68, which is 3 shots under par. She is currently tied for 8th place, 4 shots behind the leader.</p>
            <p>The LPGA Canada Open has a total prize money of 2.75 million US dollars (about 84.87 million New Taiwan dollars). Only two players from Taiwan are participating: Hsu Wei-Ling and Chien Pei-Yun. Lin Tzu-Han tried to get into the main competition through the qualifying rounds but did not succeed.</p>
            <p>Chien Pei-Yun started her game today from the 10th hole. Even though she made a bogey on the 11th hole, it did not affect her much. She quickly made birdies on the 15th and 16th holes to get her shots back.</p>
            <p>After moving to the next part of the course, Chien Pei-Yun made more birdies on holes 2, 5, and 8. She made a bogey on the 7th hole, but she still finished with a good score of 68 for the whole game.</p>
            <p>Chien Pei-Yun has been trying to improve her putting all year. Before this competition, she tried a new putter, hoping to get her good feeling back quickly. Today, she used her putter 29 times, which is an average performance.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's top player, Hsu Wei-Ling, rested for almost two weeks after finishing 6th in the British Open. She played again today but only made 2 birdies and 4 bogeys, finishing with 73 shots. She is currently tied for 87th place, just one shot away from making the cut.</p>
            <p>Last week, Akie Iwai from Japan won the LPGA Portland Classic. Today, in the first round of the Canada Open, she played perfectly again with 7 birdies and no mistakes. She is currently in the lead alone with 64 shots.</p>

            <h1>Tainan YouBike 2.0 Expected to Reach Over 10 Million Rides by September</h1>
            <p>On August 22, the Tainan City Government announced that YouBike 2.0, the public bike sharing system, has been active for about two and a half years since February 2023. They expect it to reach more than 10 million rides by September. The person who makes the 10 millionth ride will get a gift certificate worth NT$5,000. The two people who ride right before and right after will also get gift certificates and other presents.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Transportation Bureau said today that the YouBike 2.0 system started in Tainan at the end of February 2023. As of August this year, there are 610 stations with 5,300 regular bikes and 900 electric-assist bikes. Both citizens and visitors really like using them.</p>
            <p>Right now, YouBike 2.0 stations are mainly in places where people travel, like Taiwan Railway stations, transfer stations, and parking lots. They are also in important community areas like schools and other public offices. Tourist spots are also key locations for these stations. In the future, the city government will add more stations and bikes to offer more services. This will make it easier to travel around Tainan.</p>
            <p>The Transportation Bureau also said that you can find information about Tainan YouBike 2.0 stations on the official YouBike website or by downloading the official YouBike 2.0 app. To follow updates on Tainan's public bike system, you can check the "Good Transportation in Tainan" Facebook page.

            <h1>Taiwan Businessman Sentenced to 1 Year, 2 Months for Trying to Spy for China on Falun Gong</h1>
            <p>On August 22, a Taiwan businessman named Xue Zhen-Chun, who went to Zhongzheng Preparatory School, was told by Chinese national security officers to try to get information about Falun Gong members' travel records from an investigator. He failed. He was first found not guilty, but then in a second appeal, he was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison under the National Security Act. Yesterday, the Supreme Court rejected his final appeal, making the sentence final.</p>
            <p>The court decision said that Xue Zhen-Chun studied at the Zhongzheng Cadets Preparatory School for National Defense. Later, he became a businessman and often traveled between Taiwan and China. Around 2014, he met "Manager Wang" and "Xiao Zheng," who were officers from the Fourth Bureau of China's Ministry of State Security. These officers manage intelligence work for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.</p>
            <p>"Manager Wang" and "Xiao Zheng" told Xue Zhen-Chun to introduce them to Taiwan government officials and elected representatives from the ruling party. They also asked him to collect documents and news about Falun Gong members entering and leaving Taiwan.</p>
            <p>While studying in an in-service program at National Chengchi University, Xue Zhen-Chun met an investigator named Lai. In 2018, Xue twice asked Lai during meals if he could get the travel records of Falun Gong members. He offered to help Lai get intelligence from China in return. However, Lai did not agree. When Xue was questioned, he denied doing anything wrong, saying that "Manager Wang" and "Xiao Zheng" were people he made up.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court, in its first ruling, believed that the travel records of Falun Gong members were important to relations between Taiwan and China and could affect social stability. The court noted that Xue Zhen-Chun ignored the support he received from his country and showed no regret. He was found guilty under the National Security Act for trying to get secret official documents and information for a Chinese government agency, with the aim of affecting social stability. He was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison.</p>
            <p>After an appeal, the Taiwan High Court reviewed the case and found there was not enough evidence, changing the verdict to not guilty. But the Supreme Court canceled this decision and sent the case back. The High Court, in its first re-trial, still believed there was not enough evidence, so the Supreme Court canceled it again and sent it back.</p>
            <p>In the second re-trial, the court decided that travel information is a secret official document and message. It is also important information that is strictly controlled. If Chinese administrative, military, or party organizations get this information, it could harm people's freedom to live and travel, their personal safety, and their privacy. It could also weaken a free and democratic society and threaten social stability.</p>
            <p>The court in the second re-trial considered that Xue Zhen-Chun tried to get secret official documents and information for people in mainland China. Luckily, Mr. Lai noticed something was wrong and did not help, so Xue did not succeed. Even though no harm was done to social safety, there was still some danger. Xue was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison. After an appeal, the Supreme Court rejected it yesterday, making the final decision.</p>
