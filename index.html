            <h1>Brothers Won by 3 Runs After a 7-Run Lead Was Reduced; Humberto Castellanos Still Has Things to Learn</h1>
            <p>The CTBC Brothers baseball team had a big lead of 7 runs today. But in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Wei Chuan Dragons scored 4 runs. The Brothers used four different pitchers in that inning but managed to win 10-7. The Brothers' head coach, Keiichi Hirano, said this kind of situation should not happen. He also said that the starting pitcher, Humberto Castellanos, needs to improve in many areas.</p>
            <p>The Brothers scored their first run in the first inning. They added 2 runs in the third inning, 3 runs in the fourth, and 2 more in the fifth. They also got 1 run in the seventh and another in the ninth. After the top of the ninth inning, the score was 10-3. But in the bottom of the ninth, the Dragons scored 4 runs. The Brothers had to use four pitchers: Chen Bo-jun, Hsieh Jung-hao, Tsai Chi-che, and Wu Chun-wei, to stop the Dragons and win the game.</p>
            <p>After the game, Coach Hirano said that because they had a 7-run lead in the ninth inning, he decided to let Chen Bo-jun pitch first, hoping he would do well. Hirano added that if the lead were smaller, the pressure would be much higher. He hopes Chen Bo-jun can do better next time. About Hsieh Jung-hao pitching to only one batter, Hirano said all decisions were made to win the game.</p>
            <p>Coach Hirano also said he always tells the batters that even if they are winning, they must keep scoring more runs. This way, if something like the bottom of the ninth happens, there is more room to make changes to win. He also mentioned that they should avoid a situation where a large lead gets smaller and forces them to use their best relief pitchers.</p>
            <p>The Brothers' starting pitcher, Humberto Castellanos, threw 95 pitches. He pitched 6.1 innings, giving up 12 hits and 3 runs that counted. He also struck out 3 batters and walked 1. He pitched well enough to get his 10th win of the season.</p>
            <p>Coach Hirano believes "Castellanos still has many problems to fix." He said Castellanos should pitch at least 7 innings. He hopes Castellanos will not be happy just with this game, as there are more important games in September. He reminded everyone that the Brothers missed winning the first-half championship by only a few games.</p>

            <h1>Hormone-Positive Breast Cancer Returned as Triple-Negative; New Health Insurance Drug Helps Improve Condition</h1>
            <p>Emily, a woman in her 40s, found out two years ago that she had Stage 2 hormone-positive breast cancer during a regular check-up. She bravely got treatment, and her health was good for a while. But this year, the cancer spread, and it also changed into a type called triple-negative breast cancer. After only two treatments with a new medicine that is paid for by health insurance, her tumor became smaller. Now, she is smiling again.</p>
            <p>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers for women in Taiwan. More than 10,000 women are diagnosed with it every year, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p>
            <p>Many breast cancer patients are scared that their cancer will come back. Dr. Ya-wen Yang, a surgeon at National Taiwan University Hospital, often tells her patients, "When you leave the clinic, you are normal people." She says this to help them go back to their normal lives.</p>
            <p>Dr. Yang shared in a news report today that "You have gone through so much difficult treatment. You know how to value life more than others and have very important life experiences." She wants breast cancer patients who have finished treatment not to worry too much. She says that returning to a normal life is an important goal of treatment. Even if the cancer comes back, if they take their medicine regularly and go for check-ups, they can still control the illness.</p>
            <p>Emily is a great example. Two years ago, she always took care of her health and got regular checks. That is when doctors found her Stage 2 hormone-positive breast cancer. Her medical team saw her as a model patient. When she faced cancer, she bravely had surgery, chemotherapy, and hormone medicine. She also went to her follow-up appointments and did what her doctor said. But this year, her cancer cells spread, and the cancer changed to triple-negative breast cancer.</p>
            <p>Further tests showed that Emily's cancer cells were HER2 weak positive. After her doctor thought about it, she was given a new type of medicine called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which is now covered by health insurance. After two treatments, her tumor got smaller. The fluid in her left lung also got better, making it easier for her to breathe. Now, her health is stable. She is starting to feel better emotionally and has more hope to fight her illness.</p>
            <p>Unlike countries in Europe and America, women in Taiwan get breast cancer most often at two different ages: between 45 and 49, and between 60 and 64. Dr. Yang Ya-wen explained that this might be because of genes. It also might be because of changes in diet, like eating more Western food, and lifestyle habits. These include smoking, drinking alcohol, not exercising enough, stress, and changes in hormones. Early breast cancer usually does not cause much pain, so getting regular check-ups is very important.</p>
            <p>Starting this year, the National Health Administration has made free breast cancer screening available to more women. Before, it was for women aged 45 to 69. Now, women aged 40 to 74 can get screened. Dr. Mu-chun Yang, a doctor at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, asks all women to get regular breast cancer screenings. This helps doctors find the cancer early and treat it quickly. When breast cancer is found early, patients usually do very well. Even if there are problems, he says, do not give up, because medical treatments have improved a lot.</p>
            <p>Dr. Yang Mu-chun said that breast cancer treatments are getting better very fast. The ADC medicine that health insurance started to cover this year is one example. This medicine uses both targeted therapy and chemotherapy to attack cancer cells very precisely. It also has a "bystander effect" that kills nearby cancer cells, helping to treat different kinds of tumors. This new treatment goes beyond old ways of classifying cancer. It works for HER2 weak positive cases, which make up half of all breast cancers. This helps doctors give more specific and personal treatment to each patient.</p>

            <h1>Five People Died in a House Fire in Zhongli, Taoyuan; Prosecutors Say All Died from Not Being Able to Breathe</h1>
            <p>A house fire happened in Zhongli District, Taoyuan City, early this morning and caused five deaths. The reason for the fire is still being looked into. After examining the bodies, the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office said that all five people died because they could not breathe. The office has told the Taoyuan branch of the Victim Protection Association to help the family and give them some money. This shows that the legal system cares for people.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Fire Department said they got a call at about 5:31 AM that there was a house fire on Longan Street in Zhongli District. They quickly sent fire trucks and people to help. However, the fire sadly killed five people: Ms. Huang (35 years old), her daughter (10 years old) and son (9 years old) named Ye, and her friend's son (10 years old) and daughter (9 years old) also named Ye. Fire investigators are still trying to find out the exact cause of the fire.</p>
            <p>In a statement released in the evening, the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office said that they sent Chief Prosecutor Li Chia-hao and Prosecutor Lai Ying-yu to the fire scene. They looked at the area and told the police and fire department to keep collecting evidence.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutor's Office said that in the afternoon, the prosecutors and a forensic doctor examined the bodies. They found that all five people died from not being able to breathe due to suffocation and respiratory failure. They quickly gave out death certificates so the families could arrange the funerals. Also, the Prosecutor's Office immediately told the Victim Protection Association's Taoyuan branch to come and help. The association gave each family NT$5,000 to help, showing kindness from the legal system.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutor's Office said that they will work with the police and fire departments to find out why the fire started and who is responsible by law. If the families need a place to stay or legal help later, the Taoyuan branch of the Victim Protection Association will continue to offer support.</p>
            <p>The Social Welfare Bureau said that its director, Chen Pao-min, visited the families this morning to offer comfort. He also shared that Taoyuan Mayor Chang San-cheng was concerned and cared about them. At the same time, the Social Welfare Bureau started its disaster relief plan. Their social workers immediately stepped in to give emotional support, connect families with help, and provide necessary services. They are also working with the Education Bureau and local district offices to help the families settle their lives and get through this hard time.</p>
