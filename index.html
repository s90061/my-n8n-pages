            <h1>Portland Protesters Hold Naked Bike Ride Against Trump's National Guard Plan</h1>
            <p>American protesters in Portland, Oregon, took part in a special "World Naked Bike Ride" event today. They were protesting against the Trump government's plan to send the National Guard into the city.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, hundreds of protesters rode their bikes almost naked in the cold and wet weather. This showed Portland's well-known unusual and modern style.</p>
            <p>In recent days, protesters have gathered outside an immigration center in Portland. They used funny and strange ways to show their opinions. Many wore costumes like inflatable frogs, unicorns, and bananas. They faced off against federal police, who sometimes used tear gas and pepper balls.</p>
            <p>The World Naked Bike Ride is usually an event held every summer in many cities around the world. The organizers added this extra event this weekend to protest against President Trump's plan to use the military to stop protests.</p>
            <p>Janene King, 51, said this was "the most Portland way to protest."</p>
            <p>She only wore wool socks, a wig, and a hat. She didn't care about the constant rain and the cold temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Holding hot tea, she said, "We definitely do not want the military in our city."</p>
            <p>They rode their bikes along the street and ended up at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building. The authorities told protesters not to block the streets. They could only protest on the sidewalks, or they might be arrested.</p>
            <p>Currently, Portland is waiting for a court decision. The court will decide if Trump can force federal National Guard troops to be sent there. Before this, a federal judge had stopped this plan temporarily on October 5.</p>
            <p>The organizers wrote on Instagram: "Joy itself is a protest. Coming together with respect and kindness is also a protest. You decide how much to wear."</p>
            <p>Because of the wet and cool weather, fewer people rode completely naked this year than in previous years. However, some still rode naked, only wearing helmets.</p>
            <p>Since 2004, Portland, Oregon's biggest city, has held a naked bike ride event every year. It has attracted nearly ten thousand people. Participants rode through the streets happily with music.</p>

            <h1>South Korea and US Discuss New Plan for Tariff Agreement</h1>
            <p>South Korea and the United States have not agreed on tariff talks. This is because of how South Korea promised to invest. Today, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said that the US has offered a new plan. They are now looking at this new plan.</p>
            <p>Earlier, South Korea offered to invest 350 billion US dollars in the US. In return, the US would lower tariffs on goods from South Korea. But in later talks, both sides could not agree on the amount of direct investment and how to share profits.</p>
            <p>Today, during a parliamentary meeting, Cho Tae-yul explained that when South Korea first offered the 350 billion US dollar investment, it included direct investment, loans, and loan guarantees. But later, it was changed to all direct investment. So, South Korea said it could not do 350 billion US dollars in direct investment.</p>
            <p>Cho Tae-yul said that if South Korea made a direct investment of 350 billion US dollars, it could cause problems with foreign exchange. This would badly affect the economy. After explaining this to the US, Washington offered a new plan. They are now discussing it.</p>
            <p>He also said that they will try their best to solve the investment issue before the South Korea-US summit. This summit will take place during the APEC meeting at the end of October.</p>
            <p>South Korean Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance, Koo Yun-cheol, also attended the parliamentary meeting today. He said it is important to finish the tariff talks with the US soon. He also said that a meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is being planned for October 15.</p>
            <p>When asked if they could handle the 350 billion US dollar direct investment plan, Koo Yun-cheol admitted it would be "very difficult." He said that last time, he fully convinced Bessent about the foreign exchange market problem. Bessent said he would discuss it again within the US government.</p>

            <h1>Osaka Expo Ends After 184 Days; Visitors Say Goodbye</h1>
            <p>The 2025 World Expo in Osaka closed today. The "Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition" announced that during the 184-day event, about 25.08 million people visited the venue on Yumeshima, an artificial island in Osaka. They expect to make a profit of 23 billion to 28 billion Japanese Yen (about 4.7 billion to 5.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>This morning, the East Gate entrance was full of people waiting to enter before it opened. On the "Ring Roof," which is the main part of the venue, staff from international pavilions held hands and said goodbye to visitors sadly. The closing ceremony will be held at 2 PM (1 PM Taiwan time). Prince Fumihito Akishino and his wife, who are honorary presidents of the Expo, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will be there. They will give closing speeches. The Osaka Expo will officially finish at 10 PM.</p>
            <p>Until October 12, the Osaka Expo had 25.29 million visitors in total. This is more than the 22.05 million visitors at the Aichi Expo in 2005. However, it did not reach the 28.2 million visitors that the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition expected. A total of 22.07 million tickets were sold. The event is expected to make a profit of 23 billion to 28 billion Japanese Yen.</p>
            <p>On the last day of the Expo, many pavilions had long lines of visitors. These included the USA Pavilion, France Pavilion, Italy Pavilion, and Taiwan's TECH WORLD Pavilion by E.SUN Technology company. Many people wanted to see them one last time. The TECH WORLD Pavilion will have a light-off ceremony at 8 PM tonight.</p>
            <p>Some Osaka residents visited the TECH WORLD Pavilion today and said it was "really great." A girl from Kitakyushu wore a hat given by the TECH WORLD Pavilion. She said she got the hat when she visited the TW Pavilion at the Expo last time. Today, she wore it especially for her last visit to the Expo and bought "Myaku-Myaku" mascot items.</p>
            <p>Many pavilions had signs in their own languages to say thank you. Some visitors wrote messages on glass or on the pavilions. These messages included "Osaka Expo is the best," "Thank you for six months of wonderful memories," "When will Osaka host the Expo again?", and "Thank you, Myaku-Myaku." These messages showed their sadness to say goodbye.</p>
            <p>The Expo happens every five years. The next one will be held in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.</p>
