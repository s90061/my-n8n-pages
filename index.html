            <h1>Russia Lifts Tsunami Warning for Kamchatka Peninsula After Strong Earthquake Near Kuril Islands</h1>
            <p>After a strong earthquake near the Kuril Islands, Russia has ended its tsunami warning for the Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Russia's emergency services said on Telegram, "The waves are expected to be small, but people should still stay away from the coast." The U.S. Tsunami Warning System measured the earthquake at 7.0 magnitude but did not send out a tsunami alert.</p>
            <p>Also, Russian news agency RIA and scientists said today that the Krasheninnikov Volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula erupted during the night. It sent out lava for the first time in 600 years.</p>
            <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano is about 1856 meters high. This eruption sent ash 6000 meters into the air.</p>
            <p>The big earthquake near the Kuril Islands and the volcano eruption might be connected to a very strong 8.8 magnitude earthquake that happened in Russia's Far East last week.</p>
            <p>The Kuril Islands are south of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Russian scientists warned on July 30 that strong aftershocks might happen in this area in the next few weeks.</p>

            <h1>AccuseFive Returns Home to Perform, Ancy Thanks Fans: You Make Me Proud to Come Back to Yilan</h1>
            <p>The band AccuseFive performed in their hometown Yilan yesterday. It was their first time back at their old school, Yilan Senior High School, in three years. Ancy, a band member, stood on the stage where she first started singing. She said, "Thank you everyone for giving me so much courage on this journey. You made me proud and confident to come back here."</p>
            <p>AccuseFive's tour started in their hometown Yilan. After touring the world twice and performing in large stadiums everywhere, this time they wanted to be closer to their fans. So, AccuseFive chose to return in a very personal and emotional way. Yesterday, they played at their old school, Yilan Senior High School. Fans agreed to wear school uniforms and dress up as teachers and military instructors to travel back in time with AccuseFive. After the show, the band held a special signing event for their fans.</p>
            <p>When AccuseFive played in their hometown this time, Ancy spoke from her heart. She said in a press release, "This is where I started singing. When I was a student, I found out the school had a singing contest. At that time, I wasn't very confident. I just thought I could try it. But that day, I found a little bit of courage and came to this place, and I've been singing ever since."</p>
            <p>Yun An thanked the fans, saying, "This is AccuseFive's 8th year. We hope to sing for 20 years."</p>
            <p>Zhe Qian happily said, "Thank you to every fan here. You let us have fun on stage. I see myself as a candle, taking in all kinds of energy, burning myself to light up your way."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Financial Industry's First-Half Profit Down 37%, Only Banking Sector Continues to Hit New Highs</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's financial industry made a total of NT$378.116 billion in the first half of this year. This is 37.51% less than the same time last year. Only the banking sector saw its profits increase. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) explained that banks earned more because of higher interest and fee income. This led to banks making NT$301.88 billion before taxes in the first half, which is a new record for this period.</p>
            <p>The FSC shares information on the pre-tax profits of the three main financial sectors: banking, insurance, and securities, futures, and investment trusts. The banking sector includes local banks, foreign banks in Taiwan, Chinese banks in Taiwan, credit cooperatives, bills finance companies, and postal savings. The insurance sector includes life insurance and property insurance companies.</p>
            <p>Last year, the Taiwan stock market grew a lot. This helped the financial industry earn NT$606.176 billion before taxes in the first half of last year, a record high. In 2024, with good stock and currency markets, the financial industry's total profit was expected to reach NT$1.0058647 trillion, making over a trillion for the first time. However, this year, due to new US trade rules and the New Taiwan dollar getting much stronger by 10.97% in the second quarter, life insurance companies lost a lot of money from currency exchange. So, in June, the financial industry's profit was NT$145.341 billion. For the first half of this year, the total profit of NT$378.116 billion was 37.51% lower than last year.</p>
            <p>Looking at the three financial sectors, only banking had more profit in the first half of the year. Insurance, securities, futures, and investment trusts all had less profit. Zhang Jia-kui, a main secretary from the FSC's Banking Bureau, said that banks made NT$301.88 billion before tax in the first half. This is NT$2.6 billion or 0.9% more than last year. Local banks made NT$296.73 billion in the first half, a 7.3% increase. Both these amounts are new records for the same period in history.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jia-kui explained that banks did well mainly because they earned more from interest and fees, and they had fewer bad loans. However, their profits from investments and other sources went down due to market conditions, which reduced the overall increase. Postal savings lost money from currency changes, going from profit to loss. Postal savings lost NT$18.28 billion in the first half, which is NT$22.44 billion less profit than last year.</p>
            <p>The insurance industry made NT$19.4 billion in the first half of this year, which is over 90% less than last year. Cai Huo-yan, a deputy director from the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said that life insurance companies made NT$3.5 billion before tax in the first half. This is NT$211 billion or 98.4% less than last year. This was mainly because profits from financial investments dropped by NT$489 billion. This drop was larger than the NT$284.8 billion increase in profits from insurance policies. Property insurance companies made NT$15.9 billion before tax in the first half, which is NT$0.7 billion or 4.6% more than last year. This was mainly due to increased profits from insurance policies.</p>
            <p>The securities, futures, and investment trust sectors together earned NT$56.836 billion in the first half. This is NT$19.26 billion less than the same time last year, a drop of 25.31%. This shows a trend of "one bad, two good" sectors. Huang Zhong-hao, a main secretary from the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said that securities firms made NT$39.563 billion in the first half, which is 34.56% less than last year. This is because the stock market changed a lot in March and April, and fewer shares were traded compared to last year. This affected how much money securities firms made from their own trading and from helping people buy and sell stocks.</p>
            <p>Futures firms made NT$4.67 billion before tax in the first half, an increase of 12.04%. Huang Zhong-hao explained that futures trading can make money not only from the index but also from ups and downs in the stock market. Also, their own trading went well. Investment trust companies made NT$12.603 billion before tax, a growth of 9.87%. This is mainly because the total amount of money they manage is still growing.</p>
