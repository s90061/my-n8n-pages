            <h1>Canada Air Flight Attendants Strike; Government Steps In</h1>
            <p>The Canadian government stepped in today to stop the strike by Air Canada flight attendants. This strike caused hundreds of flights to be canceled and disrupted summer travel for about 130,000 passengers every day.</p>
            <p>About 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants started their strike at midnight today. It was because of a disagreement about their pay. Air Canada is the biggest airline in Canada, flying to 180 cities around the world.</p>
            <p>Just a few hours later, Canada's Minister of Labour, Patty Hajdu, used a law to stop the strike. She made both the airline and the workers go through a process where a third party makes a final decision. However, she said that Air Canada might still need 5 to 10 days to get back to normal service.</p>
            <p>The union that represents the flight attendants, CUPE, said that its members will keep striking. They will only stop when the government officially gives them a document telling them to go back to work.</p>
            <p>The Air Canada part of the union posted on Facebook. It asked everyone to remember that the strike is "currently only being sent to the arbitration process." It also said, "We still have the right to strike by law, and we will continue to do so. We must let the company know that we are in charge."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the biggest problem was pay for the time flight attendants spend working on the ground. But both sides also disagreed on their general wages. Air Canada offered to raise flight attendants' pay by 38% over 4 years, with a 25% raise in the first year. But the union felt this was not enough.</p>
            <p>The union said that Air Canada offered to pay workers for some previous unpaid work, but the amount was only half of their normal hourly wage.</p>
            <p>A source close to the talks said that the union wanted their pay to be the same as flight attendants at Air Transat. Their flight attendants agreed to a new contract last year that gave them a total pay raise of 30% over 5 years. They are currently the highest-paid flight attendants in Canada's airline industry.</p>
            <p>Air Canada did not say if the union had asked for this kind of pay raise.</p>

            <h1>US State Department Stops Visas for Gaza Residents</h1>
            <p>The US State Department said today it will stop giving US visas to all people from the Gaza Strip. This will happen while they do a complete and careful check of the process. Groups that support Palestinians said this decision was wrong.</p>
            <p>The State Department said they had given out only a "small number" of temporary medical visas recently, but they did not say the exact number.</p>
            <p>This year, the US has given over 3800 B1/B2 visas. These visas allow foreign people to get medical help in the US. These visas were given to people who have travel documents from the Palestinian Authority.</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Authority gives these travel documents to people living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which are areas occupied by Israel. The US State Department website does not have details for these two areas.</p>
            <p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations said this action was "very cruel" and a new sign of the Trump government's "deliberate cruelty."</p>
            <p>The Palestine Children's Relief Fund said that stopping these visas will make it impossible for sick and hurt children from Gaza to get medical care.</p>
            <p>The US government made this choice after a very conservative online personality, Laura Loomer, complained on social media. She was unhappy that injured Palestinians were allowed to get medical care in the US.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Loomer wrote many posts on X (Twitter). She asked the State Department to stop giving visas to Palestinians from Gaza. She claimed they "support Hamas" and are "connected to the Muslim Brotherhood and funded by Qatar," but she did not show any proof.</p>

            <h1>Hurricane Erin Becomes Category 5 and Nears Caribbean</h1>
            <p>Hurricane Erin, which is moving towards the Caribbean Sea, became a very strong Category 5 hurricane today. Weather experts have warned that it might cause sudden floods, landslides, and mudslides.</p>
            <p>The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Erin's strongest winds reached 255 kilometers per hour. This was measured at 11:20 AM (3:20 PM GMT).</p>
            <p>Erin is the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season. It is currently about 170 kilometers northeast of Anguilla, which is in the northern part of the Leeward Islands. This area includes the US and British Virgin Islands.</p>
            <p>The middle of the hurricane is expected to pass north of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend.</p>
            <p>The NHC said Hurricane Erin could bring up to 150 millimeters of rain to these islands.</p>
            <p>The NHC also warned that there could be big flash floods and city floods in some areas. These could cause landslides or mudslides.</p>
            <p>The very big waves caused by the hurricane will affect parts of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Turks and Caicos Islands this weekend.</p>
            <p>The NHC said that big waves from the hurricane will reach the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the US East Coast early next week. This could cause "dangerous big waves and strong currents in the sea."</p>
