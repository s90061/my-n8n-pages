            <h1>Taiwan's Involvement in Pacific Islands Forum May Face Interference from Beijing; Solomon Islands Lawmaker Urges Against Bullying</h1>
            <p>The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) will happen in the Solomon Islands in September. Taiwan's wish to join will be discussed again. Peter Kenilorea Jr., a lawmaker from the Solomon Islands, told CNA that no outside country has the right to tell Pacific nations who they can be friends with.</p>
            <p>Kenilorea Jr. said, "As proud people from the Pacific Islands, we must protect our region's system." He pointed out that trying to keep Taiwan out hurts the spirit of unity in the Pacific. "We must stand together and stop others from interfering with our shared future."</p>
            <p>The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), known for its strong views against Beijing, sent a letter to the Forum's office on July 15. The letter was about Taiwan's involvement in PIF. CNA got a copy of the letter. The lawmakers are worried because the Solomon Islands stopped Taiwan from being a "development partner" before. This might affect decisions at this year's Forum.</p>
            <p>The letter said that if Taiwan is kept out, it will make the Forum's office seem untrustworthy. It will also create a bad example and weaken the spirit of Pacific unity that the Forum should protect.</p>
            <p>Last July, Kenilorea Jr. went to the first IPAC annual meeting in Taipei. He told the media that before he left, the Solomon Islands' Foreign Minister tried to stop him.</p>
            <p>Kenilorea Jr. said then that other lawmakers from at least 6 countries were also pressured by China not to go to Taiwan. But in the Solomon Islands, government officials directly pressured their own lawmakers. This made him feel that "we completely sold ourselves out."</p>
            <p>China and the United States are competing globally. Because of this, Pacific island nations have recently been focusing more on their right to govern themselves. They also want to use regional groups to help islands work together, be rich, and stand strong against outside interference.</p>
            <p>However, the relationship between the Solomon Islands and China continues to worry people. They are concerned about its effect on safety and peace in the region. In 2022, the Solomon Islands signed a security agreement with China. This agreement allows China to send police and military personnel to help with law enforcement, stopping riots, and security. The Solomon Islands government says China will not build a military base there, even though some people are worried.</p>
            <p>The IPAC Taipei annual meeting was on July 30 last year. On July 31, the Solomon Islands government quickly released a statement. It said they did not agree with Kenilorea Jr.'s actions. The statement also said that no government representatives from the Solomon Islands should invite or help any officials from "Taiwan, China" visit the Solomon Islands. Also, they should not invite or help any representatives from "Taiwan, China" take part in events organized by the Solomon Islands government. This rule applies to all levels of events, including regional and international ones.</p>
            <p>In May this year, the current Prime Minister, Jeremiah Manele, released a statement. It asked all government officials and public workers in the Solomon Islands not to have any official contact with representatives from "Taiwan, China" or groups linked to "Taiwan, China." This includes not going to events where "Taiwan, China" is involved.</p>
            <p>Before this, ABC News reported in June this year that some sources said several officials from Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tried to enter the Solomon Islands in March. They wanted to prepare for this year's PIF meeting. But their visa requests were denied. The head of immigration in the Solomon Islands told ABC that they had recently made rules for people with Taiwanese passports stricter.</p>
            <p>But the report said that government officials from Australia and two Pacific island nations privately said that the Solomon Islands would not stop Taiwanese officials from going to the Solomon Islands during the Forum in September.</p>
            <p>On July 15, IPAC members from 16 countries and regional parliaments sent a joint letter to the Forum's Secretary-General. They asked the office to clearly say if Taiwan will be invited to join the September forum as a "development partner." They also asked how they will make sure decisions about who joins the forum are clear and fair. They want to make sure these decisions are good for all people in the Pacific and are not affected by just one member country or by politics.</p>
            <p>According to the letter CNA received, the IPAC members who signed it said that Taiwan has always been a valued and helpful partner in the Pacific region. Taiwan's efforts in the region clearly meet the needs and wishes of the Pacific people. If they ignore or push aside their partnership with Taiwan just because one member country has a political preference, it could harm the Forum's honesty and independence.</p>
            <p>PIF has 18 member countries. These include the Solomon Islands, which broke off relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 2019. It also includes 3 countries that are friends with Taiwan: Palau, Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu. Australia and New Zealand are also members of the Forum.</p>
            <p>PIF also has 21 "dialogue partners," such as Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, South Korea, India, the Philippines, Singapore, and China. The "China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers' Meeting" was held in China for the first time in May this year.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, Taiwan has been part of PIF since 1993. It joins under the name "Taiwan/Republic of China" and as a "Development Partner." Every year, during the summit, Taiwan sends a group to the "Taiwan/Republic of China and PIF Countries Dialogue Meeting" organized by the PIF office. In July, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they still plan to send a group to PIF this year and hold the dialogue as usual.</p>
            <p>Tom Fraser, the Global Program Director for IPAC, told CNA that the Chinese Communist Party might try to use its influence over certain Pacific island nations to pressure the Forum. But the international community must stand firm and strongly resist any attempts to keep Taiwan out of regional talks. PIF must continue to be a place for regional cooperation, and bullying should not be allowed.</p>

            <h1>Han Kuo-yu Goes to Taitung to Support Huang Chien-pin; Green Camp Asks Public to Vote for Recall</h1>
            <p>The head of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu, was in Taitung City today. He supported Huang Chien-pin, a lawmaker from the Kuomintang party. Han asked people to vote against recalling Huang. The Taitung County office of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said, "Recalling Huang Chien-pin is like recalling Fu Kun-chi." They asked people to come out and vote to recall Huang.</p>
            <p>Chang Kuo-chou, who used to be the mayor of Taitung and is now a Kuomintang county council member, held a big meeting against the recall in Fengrong Road, Taitung City, tonight. Han Kuo-yu, Kuomintang Secretary-General Huang Chien-ting, and Taitung County Magistrate Rao Ching-ling all spoke. They asked people to vote against the recall.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that many Kuomintang lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan, more than 30, are being targeted for recall. He said it doesn't matter if they are good or bad, this is "political murder," "killing them all." He added that if a lawmaker was really involved in corruption, everyone would support their recall. But today, he said, it's a recall without looking at the facts, a recall of everyone. "This is no longer democratic politics; it's political killing."</p>
            <p>He said, "I've never seen this kind of vote before." He thinks it's very unfair. He believes that whether Huang Chien-pin is good or bad should be decided by the people of Taitung County in the next election.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-pin said that the support and encouragement from the people of Taitung give him strength to keep going. He also said he was sorry to his supporters who were treated unfairly by investigators because they helped him. He asked everyone to use their "no" vote on the recall ballot to tell the ruling party, "We not only have a good heart but also confidence."</p>
            <p>The Taitung County office of the DPP sent a message. It listed what Kuomintang lawmaker Fu Kun-chi has done in the Legislative Yuan. They asked people to come out on July 26, saying it's very important. They repeated, "Recalling Huang Chien-pin is like recalling Fu Kun-chi."</p>

            <h1>SMEG Fund Holds Local Financial Institution Exchange Meeting; First Session Kicks Off in Taipei</h1>
            <p>The Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund (SMEG Fund) said today that it will hold 10 meetings for local financial institutions from July to September. The first meeting started today in Taipei. Wei Ming-ku, the chairman of the SMEG Fund, said he hopes these meetings will make their business cooperation stronger. He also hopes they will create better ways to communicate. This will help them improve their guarantee process and make getting loans faster.</p>
            <p>This year is the 51st year for the SMEG Fund. By the end of June this year, the fund had helped over 800,000 small and medium-sized businesses get loans from financial institutions. The total amount of guarantees given is more than NT$21.5 trillion, and the total loan amount is over NT$28 trillion.</p>
            <p>Wei Ming-ku said in a press release today that the SMEG Fund wants to respond to the real needs of businesses in different places. They want to create an easier and friendlier environment for small and medium-sized businesses to get loan guarantees. Also, they want to get direct information from banks about giving loan guarantees. Because of this, the SMEG Fund holds face-to-face meetings every year. They listen directly to valuable suggestions from financial institutions to make their services better.</p>
            <p>To improve services in different areas and meet local business needs, Wei Ming-ku said the SMEG Fund opened an office in Kaohsiung. They are also working to open an office in Taichung. They also hold different types of meetings all over Taiwan. This helps them talk more with local businesses, business groups, and financial institutions. This way, the SMEG Fund can be more connected to local communities. They can use local resources to help local businesses. This will help more small and medium-sized businesses understand and use the SMEG Fund's help, improve banking business, and make the local economy stronger.</p>
            <p>The SMEG Fund said it continues to support government policies. It has started the "Small and Medium and Micro Enterprise Diverse Development Special Loan Credit Guarantee" and "Additional Guarantee Measures to Encourage Small and Medium Enterprises to Increase Employee Wages." This makes the SMEG Fund a strong support for businesses as they grow.</p>
