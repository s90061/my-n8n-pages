            <h1>New Public Finance Law Dispute: Chen Chi-mai Says Everyone Should Be Fair and Clear</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance recently announced how shared tax money will be given to different cities and counties next year. This is based on a new law. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai said today that all the details should be openly discussed. This includes things like the number of older people and pollution. He believes everyone should be fair and understand each other when deciding.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai spoke at an event for a gaming competition. Reporters asked him about the shared tax money. He said that since the new law about government money passed, the gap between rich and poor areas has grown, and the balance between cities and rural areas is not good. Taipei and New Taipei cities together receive one-fifth of all the money in the country.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai thinks that when the government meets with local leaders, all cities and counties should be understanding. For example, some cities got a lot more money this time. He suggested that they should look at all the facts, such as the number of older people, the size of the land, and pollution from factories. He wants everyone to be fair and understand each other so the money can be divided correctly.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai explained that Kaohsiung and Taichung have almost the same number of people. However, Kaohsiung's share of money increased by only 52%, but Taichung's increased by about 66%. This means Taichung received billions more than Kaohsiung. The biggest problem with the new law is that it does not include things like the size of the land or the harm that industries cause to the environment when it decides how to share the money.</p>
            <p>He used pollution as an example, saying it is very unfair. He asked the government to consider three types of money together: shared tax money, general help money, and money for specific projects. He thinks it is not fair that Taipei already gets a large amount of money, and then also takes more from the other two types of help.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai also said that Taipei's subway system (MRT) has been ready for a long time. Now, Kaohsiung and Tainan are building their subways, but the money they get for this is smaller. This makes the difference between the north and south bigger, which is very worrying. He said the heavy financial burden is very unfair.</p>

            <h1>Han Kuo-yu: All Political Parties Support Bigger Defense Budget After Meeting US Senator</h1>
            <p>Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu and Vice President Chiang Chi-chen met with the head of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, today. Han Kuo-yu said that political parties in the Legislative Yuan have agreed to support increasing Taiwan's defense budget next year. They want it to be more than 3% of the country's total economic output (GDP). In the future, they want to reach 5%, like countries in NATO.</p>
            <p>US Senator Roger Wicker, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taiwan on August 29. Han Kuo-yu had a breakfast meeting with them today. Vice President Chiang Chi-chen and other lawmakers from different parties were also there, along with the head of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT).</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu explained that even though different political parties have some different ideas about defense and foreign policy, they now agree on many things. They fully support work in defense and foreign affairs and want to make the partnership between Taiwan and the US stronger. They also support increasing the defense budget next year to more than 3% of GDP and aiming for 5% in the future, like NATO countries.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu pointed out that Taiwan is in an important time. It needs to fully understand how the Chinese Communist Party thinks to deal with problems carefully. After the war between Russia and Ukraine, Taiwan feels more pressure from China. Taiwan will try to get more support from other countries. In this difficult area, talking with other countries' parliaments is very important. He hopes that friends like the US will continue to help Taiwan in clear ways.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu truly thanked Senator Wicker and Senator Fischer for their strong support and friendship. He said this shows that Taiwan should not be forgotten by other countries, and the more support it gets internationally, the safer it will be.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen thanked the US for its support for Taiwan from all political parties. He remembered when he served in the military in Kinmen during the 1996 crisis with China. This made him understand how important it is to improve Taiwan's safety, make society stronger, and keep good relationships with friendly countries in the area. Taiwan will work hard to keep improving its ability to defend itself and protect peace in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen also thanked AIT for always helping Taiwan and the US talk and work together. He hopes that they will continue to work more closely in the future.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan said that lawmakers from different parties talked with the US visitors about Taiwan-US issues. Legislator Chen Yung-kang suggested having more military talks and training between Taiwan and the US. Legislator Chen Kuan-ting was concerned about delays in getting weapons from the US. Legislator Hsu Chiao-hsin said it is important to stop conflicts and talk to people. Legislator Lin Yi-chun explained that her party cares a lot about foreign policy and defense, and that the country's interests come first.</p>

            <p>Officials in India said today that at least 11 more people have died in the northern area of Jammu and Kashmir. Four of these were children. This happened because of very heavy monsoon rains recently, which caused floods and landslides.</p>
            <p>News agency AFP reported that on August 27, heavy rains led to a landslide on a path used by people going to the Vaishno Devi Hindu temple in the Jammu area. This event killed 41 people.</p>
            <p>Jammu and Kashmir has had strong monsoon storms since August 26. These storms have caused a lot of damage. Fast-moving floodwaters have broken bridges and covered houses.</p>
            <p>Local officials in charge of disaster help told AFP that 11 people died last night in the Ramban and Reasi areas. This was because of heavy rain and landslides. A 5-year-old child is still missing under the fallen debris.</p>
            <p>The Indian weather office stated that these heavy rains have broken previous records for the amount of rain in two places in the Jammu area.</p>
