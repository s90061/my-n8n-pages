            <h1>Hong Shen-han: Mining industry once supported the economy, hopes the history of miners will be remembered by society</h1>
            <p>The Minister of Labor, Hong Shen-han, went to the "New Taipei City Miners Go Home Concert" today. This event was held by the New Taipei City Mining Retirees Association. He said that the history of miners is also the history of mining and economic growth. It is also a sad history. He hopes this history will continue and that society will remember it.</p>
            <p>Last year was 40 years since big mining accidents happened at three mines: Haishan, Meishan, and Haiyi. People who care about Taiwan's mining industry started an event called "Haishan 40" to remember this. Today, the "2025 New Taipei City Miners Go Home Concert" was held at the New Taipei City Hakka Culture Park. Minister Hong Shen-han also brought officials from different government offices. They came to show their support and care for the old miners.</p>
            <p>Minister Hong Shen-han said in his speech that for a country's economy to grow, energy development is very important. In the past, the mining industry was a key part of supporting the economy. To keep this memory alive, the miners themselves are most important. Their memories and history are not just simple facts. They are stories made of life, sadness, and many experiences.</p>
            <p>He said that this concert uses a gentle power. It makes remembering history and fighting for rights stronger. It can also get more support from different parts of society. The Ministry of Labor will fully support the money needed for digital albums about the spoken history of coal mining communities.</p>
            <p>He also said that old miners suffer greatly from lung diseases like pneumoconiosis. It is very hard for them. He hopes everyone can work together to make sure this history of Taiwanese miners continues. This is also the history of mining, economic growth, and suffering. He hopes society will remember it. The Ministry of Labor wants to continue working with everyone, whether it's about their contributions or the lessons learned.</p>

            <h1>Calls for "forced resignation" grow within LDP, Koizumi reportedly advises Ishiba Shigeru to know when to step down</h1>
            <p>Japanese news reported that last night, Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Koizumi Shinjiro, talked with Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru. Koizumi told Ishiba that he should avoid having party members ask for a new party leader on the 8th. If that happened, it would be like being "fired." So, Koizumi suggested that Ishiba should know when to quit and step down by himself.</p>
            <p>Ishiba became prime minister last autumn. Since then, his party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has lost many elections. They lost in the general election last year, the Tokyo Assembly election in June this year, and the Senate election in July. The LDP did not win more than half of the seats in both houses of parliament. This is the first time this has happened in the party's 70-year history. Because of this, some people in the party want Ishiba to leave his job.</p>
            <p>The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that people inside the LDP said that Koizumi and the party's vice president, former Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide, went to the Prime Minister's office last night. Suga left after about 30 minutes. But Koizumi stayed and talked with Ishiba Shigeru for about two hours.</p>
            <p>The LDP president (party leader) election usually happens every three years. A leader can serve for three terms. If an early election for the party leader is held, it is like forcing the leader to step down.</p>
            <p>To hold an early election for the party leader, more than half of the votes are needed. This means 172 votes from the 295 LDP members of parliament (not including the Speakers of the House and Senate) and the 47 local party offices. The LDP plans to register these votes with names at the party headquarters on the 8th.</p>
            <p>Inside the LDP, more and more people are asking for an early election. Former Prime Minister Aso Taro spoke at a meeting of his group, the Aso faction, on the 3rd. He clearly said he wants an election. On the 5th, Justice Minister Suzuki Keisuke also asked for a new election. He was the first minister to "force" the prime minister to leave. After him, many vice-ministers and government officials openly supported this idea.</p>
            <p>Koizumi said at a press conference on the 5th: "It is very important for the party to work together. We need to create a situation where we can move policies forward." He also said, "I think Prime Minister Ishiba is also not happy with the current situation in the party. He will feel responsible for making the party unite and will think about what to do next."</p>
            <p>Japan's Fuji News Network (FNN) asked 295 LDP members of parliament about their opinions. They did this in person or by phone. By midnight on the 7th, 131 members, which is 44% of all members, said they wanted an early election. Also, out of 47 local party offices, 20 wanted an early election. In total, this is 151 votes. This number is close to 172, which is more than half.</p>
            <p>In the newest poll, 131 LDP members of parliament asked for an early party leader election. This is more than 50 people more than in the last poll in late August.</p>
            <p>Looking at the overall trend, 23 ministers, vice-ministers, and government officials, not including Justice Minister Suzuki Keisuke, want an early election. Among middle and young members of the House of Representatives who have been elected five times, 80% want an early election. Also, 80% of the Aso faction, which is 35 people, want an early election.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, only 47 people (16%) said they do not want an early election. This number is similar to the survey in August. There are still 117 people who are unsure or did not answer. The 47 local party offices are also still making their decisions. 20 want an early election, and 9 do not. The remaining 18 party offices said they would decide tomorrow, so they are waiting for now.</p>
            <p>If we combine the opinions of the parliament members and local party offices, 151 people want an early election. This is only 21 votes away from the 172 votes needed to pass. So, the 171 members and 18 party offices who have not yet decided will be very important.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, from 10 AM to 3 PM, the LDP will accept written requests from members. In the evening, they will announce if an early election for the party leader will happen.</p>

            <h1>Lai Ching-te holds talks with Hsinchu party officials, Wu Zheng: Focus on livelihood issues</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te, who is also the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), visited the Nei Tian Hou Temple in Hsinchu City today. After that, he went to the Fleur de Chine Hotel to talk with party officials. DPP spokesperson Wu Zheng said that during the meeting, the officials focused on issues that affect people's daily lives. The President promised to take their suggestions back to his team and the Executive Yuan (Taiwan's cabinet).</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te started his "Unity Tour" of 22 cities and counties across the country. He was with DPP Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung and others. This morning, he first visited the Nei Tian Hou Temple in Hsinchu City to pray. He did not talk to reporters there. At 11 AM, he went to the Fleur de Chine Hotel in Hsinchu City to meet with party officials.</p>
            <p>Hsu Kuo-yung spoke to reporters at the Nei Tian Hou Temple. He said the meetings with party officials are to understand their ideas. He believes the DPP must move forward. He said that looking at these issues together helps to unite the party, and all suggestions will be considered.</p>
            <p>There were rumors that some party members want to force Legislative Yuan party caucus leader Ker Chien-ming to step down. About this, Hsu Kuo-yung said, "Silence is more powerful than words." As for the Legislative Yuan starting its new session without anyone signing up to be a party caucus executive, he said the DPP always has many talented people, and they will appear when it's time.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, DPP spokesperson Wu Zheng talked to reporters. He said the President came to thank Ker Chien-ming and all the party officials and council members in Hsinchu. They have helped the government team since last year's big election. The President wanted to say thank you and also valued talking with the council members. He listened to what local people needed and wanted, and they had a good discussion.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng pointed out that during the meeting, the council members focused on daily life issues. They were especially worried about the needs for education and healthcare in Hsinchu. This is because many people move to Hsinchu for the Hsinchu Science Park. The President said that the central government will put more money into things like AI development, long-term care, and childcare. He will take the council members' suggestions back to his team and the Executive Yuan.</p>
