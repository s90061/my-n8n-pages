**Tongxiao Sand Sculpture Festival: Damaged Artwork Repaired Before Opening**

The 2025 Tongxiao Sand Sculpture Festival in Miaoli County is set to start on July 12th. Organizers found that one of the sand sculptures was damaged by unknown people. The face of a girl in a sculpture called "Praying for Thailand and Myanmar" was almost completely destroyed. Sand sculptors worked hard for two days and finished repairing it this evening.

The Miaoli County Government's Culture and Tourism Bureau is holding the festival. The theme is "Carefree Sand City." Many international sand sculptors from Ukraine, India, Canada, Japan, and Malaysia have created 22 artworks at Tongxiao Beach. These artworks will be on display from July 12th to September 14th.

Mr. Chen Kun-tien, the art director, said that the "Praying for Thailand and Myanmar" sculpture showed a girl praying on her knees with her hands together. It was almost finished, but yesterday morning, they found the tools around the sculpture moved. The girl's face and her hands, which were connected to her chin, were gone. Mr. Chen thinks that people might have touched the sculpture by accident because sand sculptures need to stay wet, and there were water pipes nearby. He doesn't think anyone purposely damaged it because the exhibition hasn't opened yet. After two days of urgent work, the sculpture is now fixed.

The organizers posted on their Facebook page that artists from many countries worked hard under the hot sun to create these sculptures. It's sad that some artworks were damaged. They ask people not to enter the exhibition area before July 12th to protect the art and respect the artists' work.

**AI Server Shipments Expected to Grow Slower Due to Geopolitics**

A research company named TrendForce announced today that they have updated their predictions for AI server shipments. They still expect a good increase in 2025 because of strong demand from big cloud service companies and manufacturers in North America. However, due to politics and export rules from the US that affect the Chinese market, they have slightly lowered the global growth rate for AI server shipments to 24.3%.

TrendForce said that large cloud service providers in North America are still the main reason for the growth in the AI server market. Also, projects for data centers and government-controlled clouds in the Middle East and Europe are adding to the steady demand.

Looking at the top five cloud service providers in North America, TrendForce explained that Microsoft is still investing a lot in AI this year. This means they are buying fewer regular servers. For AI servers, Microsoft mainly uses NVIDIA's GPU solutions. Their own specially designed AI chips are developing slower, and their new Maia solution is expected to be widely available in 2026.

TrendForce also noted that Meta's need for regular servers has increased a lot this year because of new data centers. Most of their servers use AMD platforms. Meta is also working hard on AI server systems and developing their own AI chips. Their MTIA chip shipments are expected to double in 2026.

Google's demand for servers has greatly increased this year due to government cloud projects and new data centers in Southeast Asia. Google already uses a lot of its own chips. Their TPU v6e chips for AI are now widely used.

For AWS, their own Trainium v2 chip is their main platform. TrendForce said that AWS is working on different versions of Trainium v3, which will be available in 2026. Because of the expansion of the Trainium platform and faster AI chip development, AWS's own AI server shipments are expected to double in 2025, making them the strongest among US cloud service providers.

TrendForce's study shows that Oracle buys more AI servers and in-memory database (IMDB) servers compared to the other four big cloud providers. This year, Oracle will focus more on building AI server systems. Besides using AI for their own cloud databases, their need for NVIDIA GB Rack NVL72 has also increased because of government cloud projects in the US and other places. In April this year, TrendForce had predicted a 24.5% growth rate for AI server shipments in 2025.
