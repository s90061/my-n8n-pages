**AI-Generated Voices Sound Real; Someone Pretended to Be US Secretary of State**

In June, someone used AI-generated voices to pretend to be US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This person then contacted three foreign ministers and two US officials, according to diplomatic messages from the US State Department.

Reports say that in mid-June, the impersonator made an account on Signal called "Marco.Rubio@state.gov." They used this account to talk to three foreign ministers, one US governor, and one member of Congress. The impersonator left voice messages for at least two people and sent text messages to invite one person to chat on Signal.

It is not known what the fake Rubio said in the messages. However, the State Department messages say that "the person probably wanted to use AI-generated text and voice messages to trick people into giving information or account details." The Washington Post first reported this news.

The State Department sent a message on July 3 to all diplomatic offices. It told them to warn their partners about fake accounts and online scams. The message did not say who the three foreign ministers and two US officials contacted by the fake Rubio were. The message also said that authorities are looking into two other cases where people pretended to be State Department staff using email and messaging apps.

**Grand Justice Review: Tsai Chiu-ming Suggests Solving Judicial Overwork and Protecting Victims' Rights**

On July 9, the Legislative Yuan reviewed Tsai Chiu-ming, who has been nominated to be a Grand Justice and the President of the Judicial Yuan. Tsai Chiu-ming said that the problems in Taiwan's legal system are heavy workloads and a lack of public trust. So, solving the problem of overworked judges is a main goal if he gets the job. He will also focus on protecting the rights of crime victims.

In March, the President's Office named seven people to be Grand Justices. The Legislative Yuan will now vote to approve them. Tsai Chiu-ming told the Legislative Yuan that judges in all courts have a very heavy workload. This heavy workload can make trials slower and affect how fair decisions are. He wants to fix this problem if he becomes Grand Justice.

To help judges with their heavy workload, Tsai Chiu-ming said he will ask the human resources department to figure out how many more staff are needed for a good working environment. He will try his best to get more people from the government. He also said that if he is approved, he will work with the Ministry of Justice to make less serious crimes no longer punishable by law and add more crimes that can be settled by agreement. He also wants to encourage other ways to solve legal problems earlier to reduce the number of cases going to court.
