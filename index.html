            <h1>Army Uses Special Systems to Help Hualien Disaster Relief</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 29, Central News Agency) A blocked river in Hualien, the Mataiâ€™an Creek, caused a flood. Today, the Army said it has sent 2,500 soldiers to help. To make sure the rescue work is effective, the Second Combat Area has sent mobile digital microwave systems and satellite systems. These systems can connect to regular cell phones, police and fire radios, and low-orbit satellites. This helps keep communication and control clear all day long.</p>
            <p>The Army Headquarters said tonight in a press release that the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Combat Areas are still helping Hualien recover. They have sent about 2,500 soldiers and 472 pieces of equipment of 13 different types for recovery work. Their goal is to help people in the disaster area return to normal life before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
            <p>The Army explained that the forward command center for rescue is working hard to follow its plans. It has also prepared for troop rotations, food and housing, and transport for extra help from other areas. This helps speed up the recovery. Also, while soldiers are working hard, leaders must make sure soldiers are well cared for. They should check on their physical and mental health. By sharing tasks well between work and rest, the rescue effort can be better.</p>
            <p>The Army said, "In battle, you need good command. For command, you need good communication." Helping in a disaster is like being in a battle. Keeping communication and control clear 24 hours a day is very important. To make sure help works best and fastest, the Second Combat Area's communication team has sent mobile digital microwave systems and satellite systems. These give analog and internet phone services. They can connect to civilian cell phones, police and fire radios, and low-orbit satellites. This keeps communication for command and information clear all day.</p>
            <p>Also, the Army has given out full-frequency radios. These help leaders of first-line teams in the disaster area talk quickly with police, fire, and rescue groups. This combines military and civilian communication systems. It makes sure orders and information arrive fast. This helps the forward command center know about the disaster quickly and exactly. Then, they can use people, machines, and supplies in the best way.</p>
            <p>The Army also said that to help volunteers move around easily, the forward command center's transport management part has used transport from the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Combat Areas. They have sent 3.5-ton trucks. These trucks take volunteers in groups and deliver meals. So far, they have made 39 trips and helped 897 volunteers.</p>
            <p>The Army stressed that it will continue to send more soldiers to help in the disaster area as local governments need them. This will speed up recovery. They will also make sure the safety and well-being of the soldiers helping on the front lines are good. This keeps the rescue teams in the best condition. They will work with local governments and people to quickly recover from the disaster and help those affected return to a stable life.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs: Matai'an Creek Water Diversion Is for River Stability, Not the Landslide Dam</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 29, Central News Agency) A landslide dam on Matai'an Creek in Hualien caused big floods and badly damaged Guangfu Township. Some people questioned why the Matai'an Creek riverbank was not fixed. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said the riverbank has already been fixed. The main reason for this disaster was that too much water flowed over the design limit, not a problem with the riverbank itself. The purpose of diverting the water is to make the river flow steadily. Also, the place where work is being done to divert water is different from where the landslide dam is. People should not confuse these two things on purpose.</p>
            <p>The flood from the landslide dam on Matai'an Creek in Hualien caused much flooding in Guangfu downtown. Also, two kilometers of the riverbank in Guangfu Township were washed away. After two days of hard work by the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the water from Matai'an Creek that was flowing into the town was successfully moved into a deep channel this morning. This changed the river's path.</p>
            <p>Regarding questions about the Matai'an Creek riverbank being broken and not fixed earlier, the Ministry of Economic Affairs posted on Facebook today. It said that Riverbanks 2 and 3 in Guangfu were already fixed by the Water Resources Agency before the typhoon. The main reason for this disaster was that the amount of water flowing over the top was more than the riverbank was designed for, not a problem with the riverbank itself.</p>
            <p>As for why the landslide dam was not dealt with before if water could be diverted, the Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out that the locations are completely different. The area for diverting water is on the right side of the lower Matai'an Creek, in the Guangfu section. The goal is to make the river water flow steadily. However, the landslide dam is in an upstream part of Matai'an Creek where there are no roads. These two situations should not be confused.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the water from Matai'an Creek has been successfully moved into a deep channel this morning. This lowers the risk of floods. After this, they will start full recovery and dredging work.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs thanked the hardworking staff and teams on the front line for their rescue and repair efforts. They used 151 pieces of equipment and more than 200 people to build an earth bank. This lowered the flood risk and kept people safe.</p>
