Today, Shih Nai-ju, the head of the Hsinchu City DPP branch, spoke at a meeting for local party leaders. She said that party supporters want everyone to work together and not look for someone to blame. President Lai Ching-te, who is also the DPP chairman, said they are definitely not looking for a scapegoat. He said, "If you want a scapegoat, find me. I will take the responsibility." He added that he respects the party group's own decision on whether to choose new leaders and will not get too involved.</p>

            <h1>Hotai Motor's August Sales Reach Record High for the Period; Aims for 36.7% New Car Market Share This Year</h1>
            <p>Car companies are slowly announcing their sales for August. Hotai Motor's total sales for August were NT$23.863 billion. This is 15.09% more than last year and the highest ever for this month. For the first eight months of this year, Hotai Motor's sales were NT$186.956 billion, which is 0.48% higher than the same time in 2024.</p>
            <p>Hotai Motor said before that its Toyota and Lexus brands sold a total of 11,914 vehicles in August. This is the highest number for this month in history. They had a 40.4% share of the new car market in Taiwan, which is the highest for this month in almost 15 years.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to September, Hotai Motor expects to sell 10,800 Toyota and Lexus cars. This would be about 36% of the estimated 30,000 new cars expected to be sold in Taiwan that month.</p>
            <p>Regarding Taiwan's new car market this year, Hotai Motor previously said that the market changes are not very clear. The main thing they cannot control this year is still the tariffs from the United States. The situation of the car market this year will become clearer after policies like tariffs are decided. Uncertain policies might make some customers less willing to buy cars. However, Hotai Motor's car delivery process has become more stable.</p>
            <p>Looking at their sales goals for this year, Hotai Motor said they have not changed. Their goal for total new car sales, including passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and commercial vehicles, is still 165,000 units. They continue to aim for a market share of 36.7% this year. For Toyota cars, they expect to sell 130,000 units, aiming for a 29% market share. For Lexus, they estimate 28,500 units and a 6.3% market share. For Hino, they estimate 6,350 units and a 1.4% market share.</p>
