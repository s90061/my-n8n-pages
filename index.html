Black is the most popular color, and grey is the second most popular.</p>
            <p>On August 14th, HTC launched its first AI smart glasses, VIVE Eagle. These glasses can work with Traditional Chinese. They have an AI assistant that can translate, search, and recognize things visually. They are also 100% designed and made in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Huang Chao-ying, who is a vice president for global sales at HTC, said, "The VIVE Eagle will definitely be the best-selling VIVE product in HTC's history." Recently, HTC's stock price has gone up very fast. In less than half a month, the price increased by about 64.8% and reached 70 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile and HTC are the only ones selling the HTC VIVE Eagle AI glasses. They will officially start selling on September 1st. People are watching how well they sell.

            <h1>Extra Budget Passed: Executive Yuan to Send 63.6 Billion for Local Subsidies</h1>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan passed several important laws. These include changes to a special law for resilience, which covers giving money to everyone and supporting industries more. They also passed an extra budget for this year, which includes money for local governments. The Executive Yuan said that they will follow the Legislative Yuan's decision. They will immediately send an extra 63.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars in general subsidies to local governments, as the law says.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan also passed the extra budget for the central government for the year 2025. They agreed to add more than 81.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars for things like local government subsidies, payments for not cutting down trees, better pay for soldiers, and other items. However, some money was removed. This included 1.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars for the Central Election Commission for referendums and recalls, 401.46 million New Taiwan Dollars for media promotion for different government departments, and 280 million New Taiwan Dollars for the Ministry of Culture. In total, more than 5.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars were cut. Also, a special budget of 60 billion New Taiwan Dollars for recovery and rebuilding after Typhoon Danas and heavy rains on July 28th was passed completely, but some parts were put on hold.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said in a message to the media tonight that the Legislative Yuan has asked the Executive Yuan to immediately send the extra 63.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars in general subsidies to local governments. The Executive Yuan will do this according to the law.</p>
            <p>But she also said that the Executive Yuan is sad about the 5.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars cut from the extra budget. This includes 280 million New Taiwan Dollars for the Ministry of Culture and 1.54 billion New Taiwan Dollars for the Central Election Commission to manage elections like referendums.</p>
            <p>Regarding the full approval of the special budget for recovery and rebuilding, Li Hui-chih pointed out that Premier Cho Jung-tai had previously met with Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu about this special law. During discussions in the Legislative Yuan, they also asked for the Executive Yuan's ideas first. With the Executive Yuan's agreement, the maximum amount for the special budget was raised to 60 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Today, the budget passed without any cuts. The Executive Yuan specially thanked the Legislative Yuan for thinking about the urgent needs of the people. They will use this special budget to speed up recovery work after the disaster. They also hope this way of talking to each other can be a good example for how different political parties work together in the future.</p>

            <h1>Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Removed from Office, Hurting Shinawatra Family's Political Power</h1>
            <p>Today, Thailand's Constitutional Court decided to remove suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn from her job. Six judges agreed, and three disagreed. She was in office for only one year. The court said she did not follow moral rules. This decision is another big blow to the political power of the Shinawatra family. It could also start a new time of unrest in the country.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who is 39 years old, is the youngest daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin Shinawatra is a former Prime Minister of Thailand and a rich person who has caused arguments. Paetongtarn was once the youngest Prime Minister of Thailand.</p>
            <p>For 20 years, powerful people in Thailand have been fighting for control. Now, Paetongtarn is the sixth Prime Minister from or supported by the Shinawatra family to be removed from power by the military or the courts.</p>
            <p>A court with nine judges decided that Paetongtarn did not follow the moral rules for a Prime Minister. This happened when she talked on the phone with Hun Sen, the former Prime Minister of Cambodia, in June. A recording of this phone call was later shared online.</p>
            <p>In the phone call, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen "Uncle." She also called a Thai military leader her "opponent." This caused a strong reaction in Thailand, where the military has a lot of power.</p>
            <p>Conservative lawmakers in Thailand said that Paetongtarn was too respectful to Cambodia and made the military weaker. Her main political partners also left in anger. This almost made the government fall apart.</p>
            <p>Paetongtarn stayed in power, but several senators took her to the Constitutional Court. They said she broke the constitution's rules for ministers, which require "clear honesty" and "moral standards." They wanted her removed from office. The court suspended her on July 1st.</p>
            <p>The Thai Constitutional Court stated in its decision that Paetongtarn's leaked phone call with Hun Sen in June did not follow moral standards. The court also said that Paetongtarn put her personal interests before the country's interests. This hurt the country's reputation and made people lose trust.</p>
            <p>The Constitutional Court's statement said, "Because the accused's personal relationships seemed to agree with Cambodia's position, the accused was always happy to follow or act according to Cambodia's wishes."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Paetongtarn said today that she tried her best for the country during her phone call with Hun Sen.</p>
            <p>After the Constitutional Court removed her from her job as Prime Minister, she told reporters, "My goal was for the country, not for my own benefit. It was to save people's lives, including both ordinary citizens and soldiers."</p>
            <p>The Constitutional Court's decision makes a way for the parliament to choose a new Prime Minister. But this process might take a long time. This is because Paetongtarn's ruling party, Pheu Thai Party, is losing its power to negotiate. Also, it faces a challenge to keep its weak group of allies together, as this group only has a small majority of seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>Phumtham Wechayachai, who is the acting Prime Minister of Thailand, and the current cabinet will continue to govern temporarily. They will stay until the House of Representatives chooses a new Prime Minister. There is no time limit for choosing the Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>Currently, five people can become Prime Minister. Only one of them is from the Pheu Thai Party. This is Chaikasem Nitisiri, a 77-year-old former Minister of Justice. However, he has little experience in government and has always stayed quiet in politics.</p>
            <p>Other possible candidates include Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former Prime Minister who has left politics. In 2014, he led a military takeover that removed the previous Pheu Thai Party government. Another candidate is Anutin Charnvirakul, a former Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Bhumjaithai Party. He led his party to leave Paetongtarn's ruling group after her phone call was leaked.</p>
