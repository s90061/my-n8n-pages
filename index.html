            <h1>Risks Grow for Japanese People in China; Business Head Asks Them Not to Get Involved in Collecting Information</h1>
            <p>Recently, several Japanese people have been arrested in China. The head of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in China, Mr. Tetsuro Honma, said in an interview that if someone accepts a task from an outside group, provides results, and gets paid for it, this could be seen as a crime under China's "Anti-Espionage Law." This is true no matter what kind of information is collected. He hopes that Japanese business people will not get involved in collecting information.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Chinese published an interview today with Mr. Honma, who is also the vice president of Panasonic Holdings.</p>
            <p>According to reports, since China started its "Anti-Espionage Law" in 2014, at least 17 Japanese people have been arrested. Among them, 9 people gave information to the Japanese Public Security Intelligence Agency for money. The Chinese government sees these actions as spying.</p>
            <p>Mr. Honma said that if this is true, it is very sad. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce has asked the Japanese government to state its position on this matter. Some people have said, "We hope that business people working in China will not be involved in collecting information."</p>
            <p>To deal with these risks, he said that Panasonic has sent out a notice inside the company: "If you receive a request from an outside group to collect information, you must report it immediately." It also reminds employees, "As a rule, do not accept such requests." Other member companies of the Chamber of Commerce are also taking similar steps.</p>
            <p>In July this year, an employee of Astellas Pharma Inc. was sentenced to 3 and a half years in prison in China for spying. He was also a vice president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.</p>
            <p>Mr. Honma used this case as an example. He believes that "the risk of being held in China is very low" if people do not contact outside groups, do not take photos of military facilities, and conduct normal business activities.</p>
            <p>But he also said that if someone accepts a task from an outside group to make something or collect information, and then provides results and gets paid, it could be a crime under the Anti-Espionage Law. "It is likely that any information collected could be considered illegal."</p>
            <p>The safety problems for Japanese people in China are not only about spying. Last June in Suzhou, a Japanese mother and child were attacked. The school crossing guard, Hu You-ping, was stabbed and died. In September in Shenzhen, a boy who went to a Japanese school there was attacked and died. This July, in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, a Japanese mother with her child was attacked and hurt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Honma said that they have told the Chinese side, "If the safety of Japanese people in China cannot be ensured, investment in China will not continue."</p>
            <p>He said that it has become common for people living in China to avoid bringing their families, or for families to return to Japan earlier. The number of students in Japanese schools in mainland China has decreased by more than 10% in the past year. The Chinese authorities are also very aware of this. After the Suzhou incident in July, they increased security at Japanese schools across the country.</p>

            <h1>7.6 Tons of Huisui Pomelos Go to Singapore, First Time Using Single-Fruit Packaging for High-End Export</h1>
            <p>Hualien's Ruisui Township is one of the main areas in Taiwan that grows pomelos. They have been selling pomelos to other countries for over 10 years. This year, they are also selling to Singapore. For the first time, they are using "single-fruit packaging" for export. Each pomelo is carefully chosen and packed, aiming for high-end sales. Today, 7.6 tons of these pomelos were officially packed and sent out.</p>
            <p>Ruisui Township has about 650 hectares of land for growing pomelos, producing more than 10,000 tons each year. Huang Sheng-huang, the head of the Ruisui Farmers' Association, said today that they have been exporting for more than ten years, mostly to Chinese-speaking markets. In the past two years, they exported about 3,000 tons to places like mainland China, Hong Kong, Canada, and Japan. This year, they are also selling to Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
            <p>Huang Sheng-huang said that a Singaporean trading company is trying to import pomelos this year and sell them in large supermarkets. Even though the amount is only 7.6 tons, they are using "single-fruit packaging" for export. They asked for pomelos that are large and beautiful and follow rules for pesticide use. Each one must be carefully picked and packed, meaning "every single one is specially chosen."</p>
            <p>He said that compared to selling them in boxes before, selling them one by one requires even higher quality. Besides looking good, the pomelos must be sweeter than 11 degrees. The packaging has labels in both Chinese and English, showing where they come from, product information, and how to eat them. This is a new challenge for the farmers' association.</p>
            <p>Also, this year they added Malaysia as a new export country. Huang Sheng-huang said the order is about 6 tons, sold in whole boxes. They are currently arranging the shipping date. This will be the last export batch this year, and they want to deliver the pomelos before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

            <h1>Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor's Contract Farming on Taiwan's Main Island Works Well; Cooperation Time Extended to 5 Years</h1>
            <p>Since 2022, farmers' associations in towns and districts on Taiwan's main island have been growing sorghum under contract for Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. The first three-year period ended in 2024, and sales were very good. The Ministry of Agriculture announced today that the second period of cooperation will be extended to five years, from 2025 to 2029.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture shared in a news release that before the Ministry was changed, the former Council of Agriculture and the Kinmen County Government helped farmers' associations on Taiwan's main island work with Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. in 2021. They started growing sorghum under contract in 2022. The first period from 2022 to 2024 has finished, and the pure local sorghum, called "Yi Gu Zuo Qi," had great sales.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc.'s contract farming of drought-resistant sorghum in Taiwan is very important. It helps to keep a steady supply of sorghum for making liquor, reduces the amount of rice fields that need a lot of water, helps with too much rice, and uses water resources better. From the first crop season of 2024, the contract price per kilogram increased from NT$21 to NT$25, which raised farmers' income and their willingness to plant sorghum.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture said that to meet farmers' hopes, allow them to safely invest in related machines and equipment for sorghum production, and ensure stable sorghum production, as well as help Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. get a steady supply, the Kinmen County Government and Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. decided to extend the cooperation period from 3 years to 5 years, from 2025 to 2029. They will continue to buy sorghum at a contract price of NT$25 per kilogram.</p>
