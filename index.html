            <h1>Trump meets Zelenskyy again and asks Russia and Ukraine to stop fighting.</h1>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for more than three and a half years. Yesterday, U.S. President Trump talked to Russian President Putin. Today, President Trump met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the White House. After their meeting, Trump said it was a good and friendly discussion. He asked both Russia and Ukraine to stop the fighting, make an agreement, and "stop now."</p>
            <p>This was the third time Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to Washington since Trump became president again. They met to talk about the war between Russia and Ukraine. The meeting lasted for more than two hours.</p>
            <p>Reporters who were with Trump said that when he landed in Florida after the meeting, he told them something. He said he told the leaders of Russia and Ukraine to stop the war right away. He also said they should agree to use the current battle lines as borders. If they don't, the situation will become too hard to fix.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Trump wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social," that his meeting with Zelenskyy was very good and friendly. He wrote, "But I told him, just like I strongly told President Vladimir Putin, it's time to stop the killing and make a deal!"</p>
            <p>He also said, "Enough blood has been spilled. The borders have been decided by fighting and bravery. They should stop now and let both sides say they won. No more shooting, no more people dying."</p>
            <p>News from other countries said that before the private meeting between the US and Ukraine, Trump spoke to reporters. He said he believed Putin agreed to another big meeting, maybe just to get more time. But Trump still thinks Putin wants to stop the war. Trump also said it is too early for the US to give Ukraine Tomahawk missiles. He hopes to make peace with Russia first.</p>
            <p>The presidents of the US and Russia talked on the phone yesterday. They agreed to have a big meeting in Hungary. This will be their first meeting since they met in Alaska in August and did not make any peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy was careful with his words. He said that Putin "is not ready for peace yet."</p>
            <p>In the last few weeks, Ukraine has asked the U.S. government for Tomahawk missiles. They think these long-range missiles can make Russia stop the war. After today's meeting, Zelenskyy told reporters that they talked about these missiles.</p>
            <p>Before Zelenskyy came to the White House, Putin talked to Trump. Putin told Trump not to give these weapons to Ukraine. He said this could make the war worse and stop peace talks.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has lasted for more than three and a half years. Since Trump became president again, he has tried to make Russia and Ukraine stop fighting forever. But he has not been able to get Russia to agree to any big changes yet.</p>

            <h1>Venezuela's President Maduro offers peace. Trump says: He is afraid to upset the U.S.</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump spoke strongly against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro today. Trump also said that Maduro, a powerful leftist leader, has offered important changes to make things better with Washington.</p>
            <p>A reporter from the White House asked Trump about news that Venezuela wants to make relations less tense. Trump replied, "You are right, he is ready to give everything. Do you know why? Because he is scared to cause problems with the United States."</p>
            <p>Washington says that President Maduro's government is involved in moving illegal drugs. To "fight drugs," the U.S. has sent many soldiers and equipment to the area. This includes special planes that cannot be easily seen and seven U.S. Navy ships.</p>
            <p>This week, a website called Flightradar24 showed that two large U.S. B-52 airplanes flew for hours over the Caribbean Sea. This was near Venezuela.</p>
            <p>The U.S. military said today that this flight showed that America is ready to stop enemies, train its pilots better, and make sure its soldiers around the world are always prepared.</p>
            <p>This strong military action makes the government of Venezuela worried. They think the U.S. really wants to remove the current government in Venezuela.</p>
            <p>The U.S. says that at least six ships used for illegal drugs started from Venezuela. U.S. military operations, which were new and very strong, attacked these ships. More than 24 people died in these attacks.</p>
            <p>Washington has not yet shown proof that the ships they attacked were truly carrying illegal drugs. Experts say that even if the ships were carrying drugs, attacking and killing people in this way is still against international law.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Go Up a Little, But Fall for Third Week in a Row.</h1>
            <p>Oil prices went up a little today. But for the third week in a row, the prices ended lower. This is because there are signs that there is now too much oil available, more than people need. Experts have thought this would happen for a while.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price for a type of oil called West Texas Intermediate went up by 8 cents for November. It ended the day at $57.54 for one barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price for another type of oil, North Sea Brent, went up by 23 cents for December. It ended the day at $61.29 for one barrel.</p>
