            <h1>Helping the Auto Parts Industry: Ministry of Economic Affairs Proposes 6 Major Solutions, Suggests Reviewing Commodity Tax</h1>
            <p>To help companies deal with new taxes from the United States, Taiwan's Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, met with car parts makers today. He offered six ways to help them. These include asking the Ministry of Finance to look at the commodity tax again. This would help get rid of older cars faster and make the local market bigger. Also, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will help companies buy raw materials together. They will also help China Steel lower its costs so it can offer better prices to other companies.</p>
            <p>The U.S. started a 20% temporary tax on Taiwan's goods on August 7th, U.S. time. For car parts, most exports to the U.S. already had a 25% tax since early May under Section 232.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau announced tonight that Minister Kuo Chih-hui held a meeting this afternoon. The meeting was about how U.S. tariffs affect the car parts industry. Big companies that make car parts for export (AM) and for local car makers (OE) in Taiwan came to the meeting. They talked about U.S.-Taiwan tariffs and the New Taiwan dollar exchange rate to get ideas from everyone.</p>
            <p>To deal with the possible effects of U.S. tariffs and exchange rates, Minister Kuo suggested six ways to help the car parts industry. These include using smart manufacturing and AI technology to help car parts makers produce more efficiently and have fewer mistakes. They also include a policy to encourage companies to replace old equipment with new, energy-saving machines. This will help save energy, reduce carbon, and lower long-term costs, helping companies grow in a sustainable way. Another idea is to buy raw materials together to get better prices. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will also help China Steel lower its costs, so it can give better prices to other companies.</p>
            <p>Also, the government will support company innovation more. They will increase tax breaks for research and development (R&D). Help for R&D will be fast, good, and simple to encourage companies to invest in new technologies. They will also suggest to the Ministry of Finance to change the commodity tax. This is to get rid of old cars faster and make the local market bigger. And they will help small and medium-sized companies get credit guarantees for hedging, which helps reduce risks from changing exchange rates.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo said that the government is still trying to get better tax rates from the U.S. This is to make Taiwan's car parts more competitive in trade and help companies stay leaders in the export market.</p>
            <p>Most car parts makers at the meeting said that Japan and South Korea already have a 15% tax on their parts sent to the U.S. So, they suggested that Taiwan should continue to ask for lower taxes on parts. They are also affected by electricity prices, currency changes, raw material costs, and a slow local market. They really need the government to keep electricity prices and exchange rates stable. They also want the government to look at international rules and change laws about repair liability. At the same time, by making the local market bigger, they want to make sure the car industry stays strong and can continue to grow.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo said that there are about 1,741 car parts manufacturing companies in Taiwan. In the last three years, their exports have been more than 220 billion New Taiwan dollars each year. About 50% of these exports go to the U.S. This means that changes in taxes and exchange rates affect these companies very much. It directly impacts their profits and how well they do.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo stressed that the world's trade environment is always changing and affects many areas. So, we need faster and more varied ways to talk. The government needs to connect with the industry quickly, listen to their ideas, and turn them into clear and strong plans and support actions. This will help companies turn problems into chances to become stronger globally and make Taiwan's car industry more competitive in the world.</p>

            <h1>Mamoru Miyano Announces Taipei Concert in 2026, His Role as Doma in Demon Slayer Becomes a Focus</h1>
            <p>Japanese artist Mamoru Miyano did a great job voicing "Upper Rank Two - Doma" in the movie "Demon Slayer." Recently, he released a new song called "Try to Jump." He also announced that he will hold a concert tour in Taipei next year. This is a warm-up for his 8th original album, which will come out in November.</p>
            <p>After six years, Mamoru Miyano will finally perform in Taiwan. Today, he announced in a press release that Taipei will be the first stop of his Asia concert tour next year. Talking about his voice acting in "Demon Slayer," Mamoru Miyano said, "I really like Doma. The more I think about Doma, the more I feel he is my favorite character. Some people say he is hard to understand and unpleasant, but because I thought about him so much, I understand him very well. This includes how he acts and what he thinks when he speaks. I studied him completely before acting, so it felt very natural."</p>
            <p>Miyano also said that people sometimes find the characters he plays "unpleasant" or "hard to accept physically." But he believes that if people feel this way, it means the character of Doma is complete. This also helped the movie be very successful.</p>
            <p>Mamoru Miyano said that he will release more new digital songs in September and October to prepare for his new album. The new album will officially come out on November 19th.</p>

            <h1>China's Domestic Car Market Share Exceeds 70% in July, Tesla Sales Continue to Fall</h1>
            <p>New information shows that China sold over 18 million cars from January to July, which is a 12% increase. In July, Chinese-made passenger cars made up over 70% of the market. This means they are taking more sales from foreign brands. Tesla, a big electric car company, sold 13.7% fewer cars in China from January to July. Its rank in new energy vehicles dropped from 3rd to 6th.</p>
            <p>According to the local news "Daily Economic News," the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers today shared sales data for July. In July, 2.593 million cars were sold. This is 10.7% less than June, but 14.7% more than the same time last year. Chen Shihua, an official from the association, explained that July is usually a slower month for car sales. Also, some factories plan to check their machines during this time, so they produce fewer cars.</p>
            <p>The data shows that from January to July, China produced 18.235 million cars and sold 18.269 million cars. This is an increase of 12.7% in production and 12% in sales. The growth rate was a little higher than from January to June.</p>
            <p>The Chinese government continues to give money to people who trade in old cars for new ones. In July, China sold 2.287 million passenger cars, which is 14.7% more than last year. From January to July, China sold 15.841 million passenger cars, up 13.4% from last year.</p>
            <p>The data also shows that Chinese-made passenger cars continue to sell well. In July, 1.604 million Chinese-made cars were sold, which is 21.3% more than last year. They made up 70.1% of all passenger car sales, which is 3.8% more than last year. From January to July, 10.873 million Chinese-made cars were sold, up 24.4% from last year. They made up 68.6% of sales, which is 6.1% more than last year. This shows they are continuing to take market share from foreign brands.</p>
            <p>Cui Dongshu, an official from the China Passenger Car Association, said that car companies are trying different ways to make new energy vehicles (electric and hybrid cars). Also, Chinese brands are doing well in the high-end car market. Because of this, the share of Chinese brand passenger cars will continue to grow.</p>
            <p>Sales of new energy vehicles in China continued to grow quickly in July. Sales reached 1.262 million cars, up 27.4% from last year. These cars made up 51.4% of total domestic sales. This is the first time since December last year that new energy vehicles made up more than 50% of domestic sales.</p>
            <p>From January to July, China sold 8.22 million new energy vehicles, up 38.5% from last year. They now make up 47.4% of total domestic sales.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Tesla's sales in China went down instead of up. They continued to fall.</p>
            <p>The data shows that 811,000 pure electric cars were sold in China in July, a big increase of 47.1%. But Tesla only sold 68,000 cars in July. This is 5.2% less than June and 8.4% less than last year. From January to July, China sold 5.246 million pure electric cars in total, up 46.9% from last year. Tesla China sold 432,000 cars in total from January to July, which is 13.4% less than last year.</p>
            <p>In terms of sales from January to July, Tesla was ranked 11th among all car companies in China. Its market share dropped to 5.3%. In the new energy vehicle ranking, it dropped to 6th place. The top 5 companies are BYD, Geely, SAIC, Changan, and Dongfeng.</p>
            <p>In 2024, Tesla sold 657,000 cars in China in total. This was its highest sales ever, 8.8% more than the year before. It was ranked 3rd among new energy car companies in China, after BYD (3.718 million cars) and Geely (863,000 cars).</p>
            <p>Also, China exported 3.68 million cars from January to July, which is 12.8% more than last year. Out of these, 2.373 million were traditional fuel cars, which is a 7% decrease. But 1.308 million were new energy vehicles, which is a big increase of 84.6%.</p>
