            <h1>Premier Zhuo Rongtai: Military Salaries Raised 4 Times Since 2018, Government Continues to Support Army</h1>
            <p>Today is September 3rd, Military Day. Premier Zhuo Rongtai said on Facebook that since 2018, the salaries for the military have been increased four times. Each time, salaries went up by 3% to 4%. Last year, the government also increased special payments for soldiers in Dongyin and Juguang. This year, special payments for volunteer soldiers, combat units, and those working in cyber warfare, electronic sensing, and air traffic control were also raised. The government will continue to give strong support to the military.</p>
            <p>Premier Zhuo Rongtai stated that he wants to thank all soldiers who protect Taiwan on land, at sea, and in the air. He also thanks those who help in disasters and do their jobs every day. He said that what the soldiers do for the country and society deserves respect and support from everyone in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>To show support for the military, the government encouraged many businesses to offer special deals. 37 groups and 62 brands, with more than 20,000 stores (like shops, restaurants, and places for fun), are giving discounts to active soldiers and their families during Military Day. This is the biggest number of businesses ever to join this event.</p>
            <p>Premier Zhuo Rongtai said that soldiers protect the country all the time, day and night. The country also takes care of its soldiers every day, not just on Military Day. He repeated that since 2018, military salaries have gone up four times, each time by 3% to 4%. Also, the government continues to build better living spaces and improve equipment for the soldiers.</p>
            <p>Besides general salary increases, Premier Zhuo Rongtai mentioned that in July last year, the government raised special payments for soldiers in Dongyin and Juguang. In April this year, special payments for volunteer soldiers and combat units were increased. In June and July this year, extra payments were added for those in cyber warfare, electronic sensing, and air traffic control.</p>
            <p>He said that giving more support and care to the military, and being their strong backing, is the government's true way of saying thank you to the soldiers.</p>

            <h1>Thailand's People's Party Supports Bhumjaithai Party to Form New Government, Hopes to End Political Problems</h1>
            <p>Bangkok, September 3rd â€” The People's Party, which is the biggest political party in Thailand's parliament, said today that it will support the Bhumjaithai Party to form the next government. This news brings hope that a long political problem, which started after the prime minister was removed, might end.</p>
            <p>News agencies Reuters and AFP reported that the People's Party, an opposition party, decided to support the Bhumjaithai Party instead of the ruling Pheu Thai Party. This could change the situation a lot, because the People's Party has almost one-third of all the seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, the leader of the People's Party, said his party decided to support Anutin Charnvirakul, the leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, to become prime minister. They did this to stop a group of old parties that are not good to rule again from coming back into power.</p>
            <p>However, Natthaphong said their support has a condition: the parliament must be closed and new elections must be held within four months. This is "to give power back to the people as soon as possible."</p>
            <p>He said, "It is possible that the old group of parties that could not govern well for the past two years might return. It is also possible that the person who led the coup might become prime minister again." He was talking about General Prayuth Chan-ocha. General Prayuth took power in 2014, and even though he is retired, he can still be prime minister.</p>
            <p>Last week, the ruling Pheu Thai Party lost its prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, because a court decided she broke ethical rules. Last night, the Pheu Thai Party sent mixed messages. They said they were ready to go against their rival, the Bhumjaithai Party, in the election for the new prime minister, but they might also ask for new elections.</p>
            <p>Paetongtarn was removed from her job on August 29th for breaking ethical rules. This started a fight for power in Thai politics. Her party, Pheu Thai, which used to be very strong, is now trying hard to keep its weak alliance together. Their old friends, the Bhumjaithai Party, have also made a strong move to try and form their own government.</p>
