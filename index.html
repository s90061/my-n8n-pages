The "2025 Overseas Chinese Media Reporting Award" is closing for entries on July 31st. The Overseas Community Affairs Council (OCAC) is inviting Chinese media professionals, journalists, and independent creators from around the world to submit their work. Those who are chosen will be asked to come to Taiwan for the awards ceremony on October 22nd. They will also get to see Taiwan's work in sustainability and cultural preservation.

This year, the award focuses on "Reporting on Taiwan, Focusing on Taiwan." It wants people to show how Taiwan interacts with the world and how overseas Chinese people are working hard in their local areas. This can be done through print/online, radio, TV, and short videos.

There are two main award categories: "Connecting with Taiwan Reporting Award" and "Profile Reporting Award." The "Connecting with Taiwan Reporting Award" looks for stories about overseas Chinese communities and their achievements that highlight Taiwan. It especially likes reports about Taiwan's global impact. The "Profile Reporting Award" focuses on important overseas Chinese people and tells their stories.

The OCAC also has special awards this year: "OCAC News Special Award" and "YES!TAIWAN Short Video Special Award." These awards encourage young people and new media formats to spread the power of Chinese media and Taiwan's influence.

**Wang Yi: China Willing to Sign Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty Protocol**

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday that China is ready to be the first to sign the protocol for the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (SEANWFZ) Treaty. This statement was made at the China-ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

China's Foreign Ministry shared this information on Wednesday afternoon. Wang Yi suggested four ways for China and ASEAN to work together, including being examples of fairness, peace, mutual benefit, and understanding.

When talking about peace in the region, Wang Yi said that the world has many problems, but peace in their region is very important and must be protected. He said that conflicts and group disagreements should not come to Asia. He also said that problems should be solved through talks and discussions.

Wang Yi stated that China is willing to sign the protocol for the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty first.

Regarding the South China Sea, Wang Yi said it is a shared home for countries in the region, not a place for big countries to fight. He said China wants to work with ASEAN countries on ocean protection, safe travel at sea, law enforcement, and important ocean structures. He also wants to fully carry out the "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea" and continue talks on the "Code of Conduct in the South China Sea."
