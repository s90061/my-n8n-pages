            <h1>White House Asks Agencies to Plan Big Layoffs for Government Shutdown</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 24 (CNA) â€“ The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has told federal agencies to prepare plans for large-scale layoffs. These layoffs are for employees who work on projects that are not legally required to continue if the government shuts down.</p>
            <p>The OMB shared a memo with Politico, a news organization, before sending it to agencies tonight. The memo says that if the government shuts down, the number of government workers will be permanently reduced. This makes a possible shutdown next week much more likely.</p>
            <p>In the memo, the OMB asked agencies to list all their projects, programs, and activities that will lose funding after October 1 and do not have other money sources. For these areas, the OMB has told agencies to start writing layoff plans. These plans are not just about temporary unpaid leave. If the government shuts down, jobs for projects that are not important to President Trump's plans will be permanently ended.</p>
            <p>This is very different from how government shutdowns have been handled in recent decades. In the past, unpaid leave was usually temporary. Employees could return to work once Congress voted to restart the government and provide funds. But this time, OMB Director Russ Vought is using the threat of permanent layoffs to put more pressure on Democratic lawmakers in the disagreement over government spending.</p>
            <p>The OMB wrote in the memo: "Programs that do not receive mandatory funding will be the first to be affected during a government shutdown." Agencies are asked to give their layoff plans to the OMB and to tell their employees, even those who might not be affected or would be on unpaid leave during a shutdown.</p>
            <p>An OMB official, who did not want to be named because the information is not public yet, said that even if the government shuts down, some programs will continue to operate. These include Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and air traffic control.</p>
            <p>This instruction comes as Republican and Democratic lawmakers cannot agree on funding. The fiscal year ends on September 30, in just a few days. The House of Representatives has passed a temporary spending bill to keep the federal government running until November 21. However, Democratic senators refuse to support it. They want Republicans to talk about a plan that both parties can agree on, which might include extending aid for the Affordable Care Act, which is ending soon.</p>
            <p>The OMB stated in its letter that if Congress passes a temporary spending bill without extra conditions before September 30, then the extra steps mentioned in this email will not be needed.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien-Chen Helps with Charity, Wants Attention for "Black-household Babies" of Migrant Workers</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 25 (CNA) â€“ Chou Tien-Chen, Taiwan's top badminton player, is currently competing in Korea. He always cares about charity and has teamed up with "Harmony Home Foundation." Starting today, they are holding a four-day exhibition called "Giving the Same Love to 'Different' Children." Chou hopes this will make people aware of the issue of "black-household babies" born to migrant workers.</p>
            <p>According to data from the National Immigration Agency, as of March 2025, there are about 92,000 migrant workers who have lost contact with authorities in Taiwan. Yang Chieh-Yu, the founder of Harmony Home Foundation, which has long cared for migrant children in Taiwan, said that some migrant mothers get pregnant by accident while working in Taiwan. They might be afraid of being sent back to their home country, so they might leave their jobs. Then they can become "missing migrant workers."</p>
            <p>Yang Chieh-Yu explained that "black-household babies" are mostly born to migrant worker parents who have lost contact with authorities. Because they do not have legal status, the government cannot keep track of them. Without a nationality and health insurance, it is hard for them to get basic care, education, and even medical help. They face big problems in getting medical services.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-Chen has a strong connection with Indonesia in his badminton career, so he decided to join this cause. Chou is the only Taiwanese badminton player in history to win the men's singles title at the Super 1000 Indonesia Open. His coach, Cheng Yung-Cheng, is also from Indonesia.</p>
            <p>When interviewed by the media, Chou Tien-Chen said that Indonesian badminton fans are very passionate about the games. This made a deep impression on him about the atmosphere there. He said, "Besides playing on the court, I also pay attention to social issues in Indonesia and have built strong emotional connections with the local people."</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-Chen pointed out that he was very touched to see Harmony Home Foundation continue to care for these children, giving them medical, living, and education help. He said, "I hope everyone in society will help and care for these children so that every life can grow up safely and healthily."</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-Chen stressed that sports and helping others should not be limited by national borders. No matter where a child is born, they should have the right to go to school and have basic living support. He hopes to use his influence to spread care and action and make more people aware of the issue of "black-household babies."</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs Pauses Chip Export Control to South Africa After Talking with Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 25 (CNA) â€“ The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Africa recently lowered the status and changed the names of two Taiwan offices in their country through a government announcement. Taiwan's government has been looking into ways to respond. On September 23, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced that 47 types of goods, including chips, sent to South Africa would need approval first. Today, the MOEA said that this announcement was not published in the Executive Yuan Gazette Office. This means it did not start the official public notice process. It was only information on the MOEA's website. After talking with and confirming with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they decided to pause this announcement.</p>
            <p>On July 21, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Africa made a one-sided announcement to change the names and lower the status of Taiwan's two offices. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan has been talking with other relevant government departments about ways to respond. This includes limiting chip exports to South Africa. Taiwan also asked South Africa to talk and work things out soon.</p>
            <p>On September 23, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced changes to "Goods Requiring Approval for Export from Free Trade Zone Businesses" and "Temporary Suspension of Imports or Exports of Specific Countries or Regions or Specific Goods or Other Necessary Measures." Forty-seven items, including "diode chips and wafers, excluding photodiodes or light-emitting diodes" (CCC8541.10.10.00-6), sent to South Africa would need approval from the MOEA first. This was planned to start officially in late November. Today, the MOEA said it has paused this announcement.</p>
