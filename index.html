This new team, called the Corporate Strategy Development Organization, is part of the President's Office.

            <h1>AP Pan Yu-qian and Ideal Bandits Join Together, Invited to Sing New Song in Penang</h1>
            <p>AP Pan Yu-qian, a singer and songwriter from Hong Kong, was asked by Malaysia's 988 radio station to go to Penang to perform. Yesterday, Mr. Pan sang a new song called "Relatively Still" with the band Ideal Bandits. Mr. Pan said that Ideal Bandits is a group that really loves music.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Mr. Pan performed on the stage at the "After Work Fest Penang Unlimited PLAY" event. He sang the song "Relatively Still," which has not been released yet, with Ideal Bandits. Both Mr. Pan and Ideal Bandits were invited to perform in Penang, Malaysia. They worked well together on stage and off stage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Pan sent a message to the news, saying, "I always thought their (Ideal Bandits') music was amazing. I never thought I would get to work with them one day. They are all very nice people, and they are a team that loves music very much."</p>
            <p>Mr. Pan also said that he saw the music group Power Station that day. But he was too shy to go and talk to his idols. Instead, he made friends with another singer and songwriter from Taiwan, Trevor Guo Jia-wei. Mr. Pan said, "His voice is very special. I hope we can work together sometime."</p>
            <p>After his performance, Mr. Pan was interviewed. He said, "I am very honored. I hope more people will notice singer-songwriters from Hong Kong." This was Mr. Pan's first time visiting Penang. He was very impressed by how friendly the people were. He said, "It was very hot, but the audience was also very warm. On the first day, I went to a famous food center nearby. There were many different food choices, and all of them tasted very good. The fried rice noodles were the most surprising and delicious."</p>

            <h1>Will the US Subsidiary's NT$19.6 Billion Problem Be Solved? CTCI to Announce Important News on July 29</h1>
            <p>CTCI Engineering, a company from Taiwan, has a subsidiary in the United States called CTCI Americas, Inc. This subsidiary is owed about NT$19.604 billion by another company called BKRF. Because BKRF's parent company, Global Clean Energy Holdings, Inc. (GCEH), asked to change its business structure in the US, CTCI had to record a loss on its money. GCEH will have a meeting in the United States on July 28 to confirm their new business plan. On the same day, a court order will be given to approve GCEH's plan. CTCI will hold a press conference tomorrow, July 29, at 6 AM Taipei time to explain this important news.</p>
            <p>CTCI said today that its US subsidiary, CTCI Americas, Inc., was working on a project for BKRF. BKRF's parent company, GCEH, asked to change its business structure in the US on April 16, 2025. The meeting to confirm GCEH's new business plan will be held on July 28, 2025 (US time). On that same day, a court order will be given to approve GCEH's plan.</p>
            <p>CTCI plans to share the important news and hold a press conference at that time, which is expected to be 6 AM Taipei time on July 29.</p>
            <p>CTCI Engineering had previously said that for the money owed to its US subsidiary from BKRF, about NT$19.604 billion, they had to record a loss of NT$3.1 billion in the first three months of the year, based on advice from their accountants. They still need to talk with the accountants to decide if this amount needs to change, depending on the real situation.</p>
            <p>Also, the factory that CTCI built for BKRF is now working well and making products. The BKRF factory is designed to make 10,000 barrels of renewable diesel every day. It started making products in December last year. By May this year, it was making 9,300 barrels per day, which is more than 90% of what it was designed to make.</p>
