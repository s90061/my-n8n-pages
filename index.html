            <h1>US Agents Raid and Arrest Hundreds of Koreans; South Korean President Orders Full Assistance</h1>
            <p>US agents raided a factory in Georgia, USA, and arrested 475 people. Most of them were Koreans who might have been working illegally. On September 6, the President of South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, ordered his government to help them as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that South Korea's Foreign Minister, Cho Tae-yul, said a special team has been created. This team will handle the situation where over 300 Korean people were arrested at the factory in Georgia. He also said he might go to Washington to talk with US officials if needed.</p>
            <p>During an urgent government meeting, Minister Cho Tae-yul said, "I am very worried. I feel a strong responsibility because our citizens have been arrested."</p>
            <p>The factory is located near the city of Savannah. About 475 workers were taken by the police. This is part of former US President Trump's strong actions against immigrants. It is also the biggest police action at one place ever by the US Department of Homeland Security.</p>
            <p>LG Energy Solution, the company that makes batteries, is building the factory with Hyundai Motor. LG Energy Solution said it has asked its employees who were on business trips to the US to come back home. The company also stopped all other trips to the US, except for meetings with customers.</p>
            <p>LG Energy Solution stated that 47 of its employees and about 250 contract workers from the joint factory were held by the police.</p>

            <h1>Oil Pipe Breaks at Penghu Huayu Power Plant; Area Sealed for Repairs</h1>
            <p>On September 6, in Huayu Village, Wang'an Township, Penghu County, an underground oil pipe at the power plant broke. Fuel leaked out and polluted the harbor area. The police quickly closed off the area and managed traffic. They also told the township office to start repairs right away.</p>
            <p>Huayu Village is on the westernmost side of Penghu. It is a small island. The island's electricity comes from diesel generators that Taiwan Power Company helped the township office set up. Around noon today, an underground oil pipe broke for a reason no one knows yet. This caused fuel to leak and made the harbor area dirty.</p>
            <p>When Huang Yi-hang, the head of the Wang'an Police Station, heard the news, he sent Qian Yi-li, the head of the Huayu Police Station, and his team to the site. They put up safety lines and directed traffic to keep the island's residents safe. They also asked the Wang'an Township Office to fix the problem as fast as possible.</p>
            <p>For now, the ship "Guangzheng No. 2" is helping to bring fuel to the island. This is to make sure the electricity supply stays normal.</p>

            <h1>R82 Bus Entry into Keelung High School Causes Debate, Will Be Replaced by Free Shuttle Bus</h1>
            <p>On September 6, in Keelung City, one R82 bus trip in the morning added a stop at Keelung High School to take students to school. But people online said the school was being selfish. Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang said today that starting from September 8, the R82 bus will no longer go into Keelung High School. Instead, a free shuttle bus called "Anle Badu Line" will be extended to go into the school.</p>
            <p>Keelung High School asked the Keelung City Government to let the R82 bus go into the school. After the bus office asked for opinions from local offices and neighborhoods, on September 1, one R82 bus trip was changed. This bus leaves Guojia Xincheng at 7 AM and goes to Qidu Station, taking students into Keelung High School. As soon as this plan started, people online criticized the school, saying it was selfish.</p>
            <p>Today, Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang held a meeting at the city hall to hear what different people needed. Some Keelung High School students said that the bus going into the school made them safer. However, some people who commute to work said that the bus going around Keelung High School made them late for transferring to the Taiwan Railway.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang decided that the bus route should not make commuters late for work. So, starting on September 8, the bus will go back to its original route and will not go into Keelung High School. The bus office also offered another plan: a free shuttle bus called "Anle Badu Line" will go past Badu Station, its last stop, and then go into Keelung High School. This plan helps commuters and also helps students. It shows that the city government can be flexible and practical when planning public transport.</p>
            <p>The city government said that to help people change to trains at Badu Station, Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang started a new free shuttle bus, the "Anle Badu Line," after he took office. This bus runs twice a day, leaving Guojia Xincheng at 6:50 AM and 7:05 AM. The 6:50 AM bus will be changed. After it reaches Badu Station, it will turn around and go into Keelung High School.</p>
