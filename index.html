            <h1>Denmark's Prime Minister Apologizes to Greenlandic Women for Forced Birth Control</h1>
            <p>Today, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen officially said sorry to Greenlandic women. These women were forced to have birth control during the time Greenland was a Danish colony. This birth control program caused big emotional and physical pain to the people of Greenland. It also made the relationship between Greenland and Denmark difficult.</p>
            <p>News reports say that between the late 1960s and 1992, the Danish government wanted to control how many people lived on Greenland. Without asking for permission, they put IUDs (a type of birth control) into about 4,500 Greenlandic women. This was about half of all women in Greenland who could have children at that time. Some of the youngest girls were only 12 or 13 years old.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Frederiksen wore black clothes at the apology event in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. She said, "I believe that we cannot have the fair and proper relationship that many people want unless we are brave enough to look at our darkest history."</p>
            <p>Frederiksen told the women who were hurt, "So, my apology today is not just about the past. It is also about now and the future, and the trust that must exist between us."</p>
            <p>Many of the women who were forced to have birth control suffered from bad stomach pain. Some even lost the ability to have children and had emotional and physical problems.</p>
            <p>Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen also wore black. He said, "Getting an apology does not mean we accept what happened. But what we do next is up to all of us."</p>
            <p>Many of the women who were hurt wore black and cried as they listened to Frederiksen's apology.</p>
            <p>Kirstine Berthelsen, a 66-year-old retired woman, told reporters that she had two difficult pregnancies, long stays in the hospital, surgery, and lost one of her fallopian tubes. She said these problems were related to the IUDs she was given.</p>
            <p>Berthelsen said that hearing the apology directly was very important for her.</p>
            <p>She said, "This way, I can continue my life and not let hate, anger, and bad feelings take over me from the inside."</p>

            <h1>G7 and EU Plan Rules for Rare Earths, May Tax Chinese Products</h1>
            <p>Reuters news agency has reported that four sources say the G7 group of rich countries and the European Union are thinking about setting a lowest price for rare earth metals. They are also considering putting taxes on some rare earth products that come from China.</p>
            <p>Rare earths are special metals that are hard to get from the ground. They are very important for making things like mobile phones, cars, and advanced weapons. China makes most of the world's rare earths. In April this year, China put limits on sending out these metals because the United States had put taxes on some Chinese goods.</p>
            <p>Except for Japan, G7 countries buy almost all of their rare earth magnets, battery metals, and other materials from China. To deal with this risk, G7 leaders started a "Critical Minerals Action Plan" in June. Teams of experts met in Chicago earlier this month to talk about this.</p>
            <p>One source who was at the meeting said that a main topic was whether to make rules stronger for foreign companies that want to invest in critical materials. This is to stop companies from going to China. But they are still not sure if they should take strong actions against China. Australia also joined this meeting.</p>
            <p>This source also said that other ideas included limiting where these materials can be bought. But the G7 countries have different ideas about this. These limits could mean that countries have to buy materials locally or cannot buy them from certain countries like China for public projects.</p>
            <p>Two other sources said that the G7 also talked about putting a carbon tax or special tariffs (taxes) on rare earths and small amounts of metals that China sells. The amount of the tax would depend on how much non-renewable energy was used to make these products.</p>
            <p>It is also said that officials are thinking about having governments help support a minimum price. The United States has recently done this to help its own companies make these materials. Australia is also thinking about setting a minimum price to help projects that get critical minerals like rare earths.</p>
            <p>A fourth source, an EU official who did not want to be named, said that the EU is looking at many plans. These include a minimum price, buying materials together, and special agreements between G7 countries. However, no decisions have been made yet.</p>

            <h1>US Lowers Car Import Taxes for EU to 15%, Starts August 1st</h1>
            <p>Today, the United States announced that it will lower the tax on cars imported from the European Union (EU) to 15%. This change officially started on August 1st.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that documents from the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative show that the tax on EU cars will go down from 27.5% to 15%.</p>
            <p>In July this year, U.S. President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made a basic agreement. This agreement said that most EU products sent to the U.S. would face a 15% tax. The decision to lower the taxes on cars and car parts depended on whether the EU would pass laws to lower its own taxes on U.S. industrial goods and some farm products that are not sensitive.</p>
            <p>The EU took action in August. This made it possible for the Trump government to change the car taxes to an earlier date, which helps the car industry in Europe, an industry that is very important to them.</p>
            <p>According to the documents, the changes also mean that some industries will not have to pay taxes starting from September 1st. These include planes, plane parts, generic medicines and their ingredients, and some metals and ores.</p>
            <p>The U.S. said in its announcement that the list of goods that get tax breaks might change later.</p>
