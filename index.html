            <h1>US June trade deficit shrinks as importers work to cope with tariff impact</h1>
            <p>Government data shows that the US trade deficit got smaller in June. The amount of goods bought from other countries went down more than the amount of goods sold to other countries. This shows that companies that bring goods into the US are trying to deal with the taxes that President Donald Trump has put on goods from other countries, including friends and rivals.</p>
            <p>The US Commerce Department reported today that the total US trade deficit in June decreased by 16%, reaching 60.2 billion US dollars. This is less than the 71.7 billion US dollars in May.</p>
            <p>This decrease was more than experts expected. It mainly happened because fewer imported goods, like consumer products, were brought in. This is because Trump's overall taxes made it more expensive for local businesses to buy goods from other countries.</p>
            <p>On July 31, US President Donald Trump officially set up the reciprocal tariff policy he had talked about before. This policy aims to make global trade fairer, as he believes it is currently unfair to the US. The new taxes on goods from almost 70 countries now range from 10% to 41%. This is a little lower than when they were first announced in early April this year.</p>
            <p>Oren Klachkin, an economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., said that there is less uncertainty about these policies now. This is because the plans for higher taxes have been made public.</p>
            <p>He also said that businesses that hoped these taxes were just a threat must now accept that they will continue. He believes that the bad effects of these high taxes will be bigger than the good effects of having less policy uncertainty.</p>
            <p>The US trade deficit got smaller in June because the value of imports sharply dropped by 3.7% to 337.5 billion US dollars. Also, the value of exports went down a little by 0.5% to 277.3 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Regarding imports, consumer goods decreased by 8.4 billion US dollars, and industrial goods and raw materials decreased by 2.7 billion US dollars. The import of cars and their parts also went down by 1.3 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Exports also went down in June. This included a 1.3 billion US dollar decrease in goods exports and a decrease in industrial goods exports.</p>
            <p>In addition, the US trade deficit with China decreased a lot in June, by 4.6 billion US dollars, reaching 9.4 billion US dollars.</p>

            <h1>Former Romanian President Ion Iliescu dies at 95</h1>
            <p>Officials in Romania have said that the country's former president, Ion Iliescu, died today. He was 95 years old.</p>
            <p>The Romanian government released a statement online. It said, "We are sad to announce that Mr. Ion Iliescu, the former president of Romania, has passed away."</p>
            <p>The Romanian government sent its condolences to Iliescu's family and everyone close to him.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that details about his state funeral will be announced in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Iliescu went to the hospital in early June because he had lung cancer. A hospital in Bucharest, where he was treated, said last week that his health was "critical."</p>
            <p>This important politician led Romania during a difficult time when the country changed from communism to democracy. He was last seen in public in 2017.</p>

            <h1>US interest rate cut outlook unclear, European stocks mixed at close</h1>
            <p>New information shows that prices are increasing more in the United States. This makes it unclear if interest rates will be lowered soon. Because of this, the stock markets in Europe did not all move in the same way today. Some went up, and some went down, and their earlier recovery slowed down.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up a little. It increased by 14.43 points, which is 0.16%, and closed at 9142.73 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up by 88.38 points, which is 0.37%, closing at 23846.07 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 10.97 points, which is 0.14%, closing at 7621.04 points.</p>
