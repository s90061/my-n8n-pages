            <h1>Central Bank: NTD Stablecoin Will Have Limited Impact on Local Payment System</h1>
            <p>The US government's "Talent Act" has made stablecoins a very popular topic in finance this year. Taiwan's Central Bank released a report about stablecoins. It said that even if New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) stablecoins are created, they will not greatly affect Taiwan's payment systems or money supply. They will also not stop the country's money policies from working well.</p>
            <p>After the US passed the Talent Act, stablecoins started to grow faster. This led to many discussions in the financial world about how stablecoins might change money and financial markets.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank's report explained that as the total value of virtual assets around the world grows quickly, investors want more stable ways to trade in virtual markets. Using Bitcoin for trading can be risky because its price changes a lot. Using regular money for trading is limited by old financial rules. So, since 2014, stablecoins have slowly developed. Their value is linked to regular money.</p>
            <p>A stablecoin is a type of virtual asset. It can be used for payments and also has the benefits of blockchain technology. Now, stablecoins are the main way to trade in the virtual world. More than 80% of virtual asset trades use stablecoins.</p>
            <p>Most countries have two main ways to control stablecoins. One way is to make special laws just for stablecoins, like in the US and Hong Kong. The other way is to make general laws for virtual assets, which include rules for stablecoins, like in the EU and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank pointed out that Taiwan's approach to stablecoin rules is similar to the EU's. Taiwan is planning a "Virtual Asset Service Act" to manage all virtual assets, and this will include rules for stablecoins.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's planned rules for stablecoins are similar to those in developed countries like the US and the EU. These rules will cover things like permission to issue stablecoins, who can issue them, keeping assets separate, managing backup assets (for example, what backup assets can be used and checking them with an independent third party), not allowing interest payments, and sharing information.</p>
            <p>People are asking if Taiwan will have NTD stablecoins and what financial authorities think about this. The Central Bank said that NTD stablecoins are similar to how electronic payment tokens work in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank explained that issuing stablecoins means taking money from many different people, similar to how electronic payment systems get money from many users. Both are used for payments.</p>
            <p>Also, stablecoins use blockchain technology, which is similar to how electronic payment tokens like EasyCard or iPass work in Taiwan. However, the Central Bank noted that stablecoins can be used for trading in virtual markets, but EasyCard and iPass do not have this feature yet.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank believes that if NTD stablecoins are used for payments, they will not have a big effect on Taiwan's current payment system. This is because there are not many virtual assets valued in NTD in the virtual market right now. So, there is not a great need to issue NTD stablecoins for trading NTD-valued virtual assets.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank also said that Taiwan's payment system is already very good. It has many ways to pay, such as credit cards, debit cards, bank deposits, and electronic payments. These offer quick and cheap payment services. So, NTD stablecoins as a payment tool should have a small effect on the local payment system.</p>
            <p>Regarding the effect on the country's money supply and how money policies work, the Central Bank thinks that issuing NTD stablecoins would mostly just move money around in the market. It would not greatly affect Taiwan's total money supply (M2) or how banks create credit. Even if NTD stablecoins are issued, they will not stop Taiwan's money policies from working.</p>
            <p>In the future, if Taiwan decides to issue stablecoins, the Central Bank said that the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will ask for the Central Bank's opinion. The Central Bank will also work with the FSC to create the detailed rules.</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Removes Gongguan Roundabout: Traffic Heavy on First Day of Second Week Due to Weather and Accidents</h1>
            <p>Today was the first workday of the second week for the project to remove the Gongguan roundabout and fill in the underground pass in Taipei. The Taipei City Traffic Engineering Office said that traffic was heavy on Roosevelt Road (northbound) and Fuhou Bridge (eastbound motorcycle lane). This was because of Typhoon Hwagasa, which affected the weather, and also because of some traffic accidents.</p>
            <p>The work to remove the Gongguan roundabout and fill in the underground pass started on the 13th of this month. The first week of workdays was from the 15th to the 19th. The Taipei City Traffic Engineering Office looked at the traffic during this time. They found that, apart from accidents on Fuhou Bridge and Yongfu Bridge, the overall traffic was similar to before the construction. They will keep people watching the traffic until the project is finished.</p>
            <p>Huang Hui-ru, the deputy head of the Taipei City Traffic Engineering Office, told the Central News Agency that on the first day of the second week of construction, traffic was heavier. This was due to bad weather and accidents, especially on Roosevelt Road going north and the motorcycle lane on Fuhou Bridge going east.</p>
            <p>She explained more about the specific problems. First, on Roosevelt Road going north, there was an accident in front of Mingchuan Elementary School at 7:50 AM today. Traffic backed up to Lane 211, Section 5 of Roosevelt Road. After the accident was cleared at 8:02 AM, traffic went back to normal by 8:55 AM.</p>
            <p>Second, on the eastbound motorcycle lane of Fuhou Bridge, two accidents happened today, one at 8:23 AM and another at 8:39 AM. Traffic backed up to the middle of the bridge. After these accidents were cleared at 8:33 AM and 8:41 AM, traffic returned to normal by 8:45 AM.</p>
            <p>She repeated that the city governments of Taipei and New Taipei will continue to monitor all roads together. They will change traffic lights as needed and have police help direct traffic on site. If there are accidents or unusually heavy traffic, they will clear it quickly. This is to make sure people can drive safely and to reduce traffic problems during the construction time.</p>
