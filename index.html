            <h1>Unidentified Drones Cause Airport Closures in Europe; Russia Suspected of Testing NATO Defenses</h1>
            <p>For several weeks, unidentified drones have been flying into European airspace, causing airports from Warsaw to Munich to close for short periods. Europe believes Russia is behind these incidents. Russia's aim might be to cause fear in European countries that support Ukraine and to check for weak spots in NATO's air defenses.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that the latest incident happened on the evening of October 2nd. Germany closed Munich Airport, which stopped 17 flights from leaving and stranded nearly 3,000 travelers during the Oktoberfest celebration. Also, Belgium announced today that it is looking into a drone sighting over a military base in eastern Belgium the night before.</p>
            <p>Russian President Putin recently warned NATO about giving Ukraine Tomahawk cruise missiles. Tomahawk missiles are precise American weapons that can travel up to 2,400 kilometers.</p>
            <p>On October 2nd, Putin said, "Tomahawk missiles cannot be used without direct involvement from the U.S. military. This would mean a new and serious increase in the conflict, including between Russia and the United States." He also threatened that Russia's response would make its opponents "feel it."</p>
            <p>Some Western officials think that these drone events and other "hybrid warfare" actions are Russia's latest way to threaten Europe while the war in Ukraine continues.</p>
            <p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Western countries have accused Russia of many destructive acts in Europe. These include starting fires and cutting underwater cables. Russia is also suspected of putting incendiary devices on cargo planes belonging to DHL, a large logistics company, and trying to kill the CEO of Rheinmetall, a German company that makes artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>However, some analysts outside of Western countries believe that some NATO members in Eastern Europe have long-standing disagreements with Russia over airspace near their borders. These analysts think that the recent reports of Russian military planes and suspected Russian drones entering NATO countries' airspace are meant to get the attention of U.S. President Trump, to prevent his government from becoming less involved in the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
            <p>The German newspaper "Bild" reported, citing Norwegian local media, that three Germans were held on September 30th for allegedly using drones in a restricted area around a Norwegian airport. They were later released.</p>
            <p>Norwegian police also confirmed that a Chinese citizen was fined and removed from the country for allegedly flying a drone near Svolvaer Airport in northern Norway. Police are also still investigating many reports of drones near airports, military bases, and other important infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Today Russia (RT) reported that Western media and officials are blaming Russia for these drone incidents. For example, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Moscow was "very likely" responsible, but admitted he had no proof. Europe wants to use these incidents as a reason to spend more on defense and to build a "drone wall."</p>
            <p>The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) has warned that Ukraine might try to cause drone incidents and blame Russia to get NATO directly involved in a conflict with Russia.</p>
