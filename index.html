            <h1>Zhubei Air Smells Like Burning Plastic, Environmental Protection Bureau Investigates Suspected Odor Leak</h1>
            <p>The Hsinchu County Environmental Protection Bureau said tonight that the air in many parts of Zhubei City smells like burning plastic. They first thought it was not from burning things outside. Instead, they think some smelly material has leaked out. They will keep looking for where the pollution is coming from.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu County Environmental Protection Bureau said in a written statement that they have checked many areas. These include parts of Guangming 6th Road, Zhuangjing North and South Roads, Jiafeng North and South Roads, around the High-Speed Rail Station, parts of Dongxing Road, and Shixing Road. They have not found where the pollution might be coming from yet.</p>
            <p>The bureau explained that they looked at results from their sensors. The sensor results first showed that it was probably not outdoor burning. It seems more like a bad smell has leaked. However, the sensors did not show clear changes in time or place. This means they cannot use the sensor results to find the source of the pollution right now. They will continue to investigate to find out more.</p>
