            <h1>International Oil Prices End Lower as Market Considers US-Russia Leaders' Meeting Impact</h1>
            <p>Investors are looking at two things: US President Trump's decision to continue the pause in the trade war with China, and his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week. Because of this, international oil prices went down today.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, which will be delivered in September, dropped by 79 cents, or 1.24%. It closed at 63.17 US dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price for Brent crude oil from the North Sea, which will be delivered in October, fell by 51 cents, or 0.77%. It closed at 66.12 US dollars per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Korean Media: Yoon Suk-yeol's Wife Arrested, First Time Former President and Spouse Held Together</h1>
            <p>According to Yonhap News Agency, Kim Keon-hee, the wife of former South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, has been arrested. She is accused of stock manipulation, interfering in elections, and taking bribes. This is the first time in South Korea's history that a former president and their spouse have both been held in custody at the same time. They are currently in different detention centers.</p>
            <p>Reports say that late last night, the Seoul Central District Court issued an arrest warrant for Kim Keon-hee because they believed she might destroy evidence. On August 7th, the independent investigation team looking into Kim Keon-hee's corruption asked the court to arrest her. They said she might have broken the "Capital Markets Act," the "Political Funds Act," and the "Act on the Aggravated Punishment, etc. of Specific Crimes."</p>
            <p>These three accusations are related to a stock manipulation case involving Deutsche Motors, a case about political brokers interfering in elections, and a case about requests from religious people.</p>
            <p>The court held a hearing yesterday to decide if her arrest was necessary. Kim Keon-hee was there for the hearing. The hearing lasted more than four hours and finished around 2:35 PM. After the hearing, Kim Keon-hee was sent to the Seoul Southern Detention Center to wait for the court's decision.</p>
            <p>After the court issued the arrest warrant, Kim Keon-hee was officially held there.</p>
            <p>Yoon Suk-yeol was arrested on July 10th by the independent investigation team looking into a case of rebellion and treason. He is currently held at the Seoul Detention Centre.</p>
            <p>Kim Keon-hee was first planned to be moved to the Seoul Detention Centre, but the independent investigation team asked to move her to the Seoul Southern Detention Center instead.</p>

            <h1>Russian Forces Suddenly Advance Deep into Eastern Ukraine; Zelenskyy: Will Destroy Them Soon</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said that Russian troops have suddenly moved forward about 10 kilometers near Dobropillia, a coal mining town in eastern Ukraine. But Kyiv will "destroy them" soon.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy told reporters that Russian troops have moved deep into several places by 10 kilometers. He said, "All of them had no equipment, only weapons in their hands. Some of these groups have been found or destroyed, or captured. We will find and destroy the remaining Russian troops soon."</p>
            <p>He also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin being invited to talk with US President Donald Trump in the US is a "personal victory" for Putin. This meeting will also make it harder to put more restrictions on Moscow.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy pointed out: "First, he (Putin) will go to the US for talks. I think this is a personal win for him. Second, he is no longer isolated because he will talk in the US. Third, through this meeting, he has somehow delayed the restrictions."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said that both Kyiv and Moscow need to give up some land to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Today, Ukraine said that they will not remove their troops from the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine as part of any possible peace deal with Russia.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said, "We will not remove our troops from Donbas... If we remove our troops from Donbas today, including our defenses, the land we control, and the high ground, we will surely create a way for the Russian army to attack."</p>
