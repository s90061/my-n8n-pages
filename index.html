        const text = `**Trade Tensions Affect Confidence: China's Q2 Economic Growth at 5.2%**

China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, which is a bit slower than the first quarter. This slowdown is due to problems like trade tensions, a weak housing market, and people not spending much money. These issues are making it harder for the economy to grow.

The total value of China's economy in the first half of this year was about 264 trillion New Taiwan dollars. Experts believe that China's economic growth might slow down even more later this year because of issues like tariffs and a global trade slowdown. China's goal for economic growth this year is around 5%.

**Second Phase of Public Lending Right Trial Expands to 300 Libraries in 6 Major Cities**

To support cultural works, Taiwan's Ministry of Culture announced an expansion of the Public Lending Right trial program. It will now include over 300 libraries in six major cities, up from just two national libraries. This second phase will last for three years.

The new phase aims to simplify how people apply for payments and will include translators as people who can receive money. The Ministry of Culture will handle the program design and payments, while the Ministry of Education will help with book data and borrowing statistics. People only need to register their work once during the trial period.

Publishers and authors can apply online starting now. If they register by October 15th this year, they can get their first payment by the end of November.

**Washington Post: Philippines Moves Closer to Taiwan as China's Maritime Threat Grows**

According to The Washington Post, the Philippines is starting to see its national safety as closely connected to Taiwan's safety. This is happening because of growing threats from Chinese ships. As a result, the Philippines is increasing its cooperation with Taiwan, both officially and unofficially, especially in security matters.

The Philippine Defense Minister, Gilbert Teodoro, said that any use of force by China in their area is a big concern. He also stated that it's clear Taiwan's safety affects the Philippines. He agrees with Japan's idea that the East China Sea, South China Sea, and the Korean Peninsula should be seen as one security zone.

Philippine officials say that China's ships have increased greatly off their western coast in the last year, along with cyber-attacks and spying. The Philippine President has also made it easier for government officials to talk with Taiwanese officials and allowed Taiwanese people to enter the Philippines without a visa. This is meant to help with investment and tourism, but also to strengthen security cooperation.

Reports say that scholars close to the Philippine defense system have met with high-ranking Taiwanese generals. Also, the Philippine Coast Guard and Taiwan's Coast Guard recently patrolled together in the Bashi Channel. Taiwanese observers also attended a joint military exercise between the US and Philippine Marines last month near Taiwan.
