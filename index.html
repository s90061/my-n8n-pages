            <h1>US Equal Tariffs Start: Chen Chi-mai Asks for More Talks and New Industry Plans</h1>
            <p>The mayor of Kaohsiung, Chen Chi-mai, said he hopes the government will keep talking with the US. He also hopes they will think again about how industries are set up. This is to make sure Taiwan's industries can stay strong even with these new tariffs.</p>
            <p>Today, Chen Chi-mai went to the opening of the "2025 Cijin Kite Festival." Before the event, he talked to reporters about the tariffs. He said that Kaohsiung's main industries are petrochemicals and steel. For the steel industry, things like screws and fasteners are under a rule called Article 232. Since March this year, a 50% tax rate has been used for these products. This is the same for all countries in the world. However, it will also affect how Taiwan competes with other markets.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai said that it's worrying how cheaply Chinese steel products are being sold to Europe and Southeast Asia. This will definitely make it harder for Taiwan to sell its screws and fasteners to other countries. He hopes the government can take action to help and support the screw and fastener industry.</p>
            <p>For engine parts, Chen Chi-mai stated that Kaohsiung's sales of these parts make up about 15% to 20% of the country's total exports. These parts will now have extra tariffs, which will have a big effect. He hopes the government can keep talking with the US about this.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai stressed that the government must think about America's plan to bring back manufacturing and the changes happening in global supply chains. They need to rethink how industries are set up to make sure Taiwan's industries stay competitive during this tariff problem. He hopes the government can offer more help and money to support Kaohsiung's older industries.</p>

            <h1>Chikungunya Disease in Foshan, Guangdong Slows Down: Fewer New Cases Each Day</h1>
            <p>The number of Chikungunya disease cases in Foshan, Guangdong, China, is now getting lower. Officials said today that the highest number of new cases in one day was 674. Yesterday, there were 148 new cases. The number of new cases has been going down since July 29.</p>
            <p>According to CCTV News on August 9, officials in Foshan, Guangdong, China, held a press conference this afternoon. They gave an update on the Chikungunya disease outbreak, which is called "Ji Kong Ken Ya Re" in China.</p>
            <p>Officials said that the number of new reported cases each day went down from 674 on July 19 (the highest point) to 148 on August 8. The numbers have continued to drop since July 29. For the last five days, the number of new cases each day has been below 200. Also, fewer new villages and areas have been affected. This means the disease control efforts are starting to work.</p>
            <p>Officials stressed that during this outbreak, there have been no serious cases or deaths in Foshan. More than 90% of the patients have now recovered. They will keep working to help patients. They will provide good treatment and care plans for important groups like older people, children, pregnant women, and people with long-term illnesses.</p>
            <p>Officials also said that since July 23, the number of mosquitoes in Foshan, Guangdong, has been below a safe level for 17 days in a row.</p>
            <p>Foshan, Guangdong, has been greatly affected by this outbreak. On August 7, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced a case of Chikungunya disease that came from outside Taiwan. A Taiwanese woman, around 40 years old, had visited friends in Foshan and Shenzhen, Guangdong. After returning to Taiwan on July 30, she had symptoms like fever and a rash. Tests confirmed she had the disease. She has now gotten well and left the hospital.</p>
            <p>On August 5, the CDC announced that they are raising the travel warning level for Guangdong, China. It moved from Level 1 "Watch" to Level 2 "Alert." The CDC said that the Chikungunya outbreak in Guangdong, China, is serious, especially in Foshan. They remind people who plan to travel to Guangdong or other areas with Chikungunya to protect themselves from mosquitoes while they are there.</p>

            <h1>Report: Trump Orders US Military to Fight Drug Gangs; Mexican President Says "No Invasion"</h1>
            <p>Media reports say that US President Donald Trump has ordered the American military to fight drug gangs in Latin America. Today, Mexico's President, Claudia Sheinbaum, said, "Mexico will not be invaded."</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that Trump has secretly signed an order allowing military action against drug gangs that the US government has called terrorist groups. The AFP news agency reported that President Sheinbaum said, "Mexico will not be invaded."</p>
            <p>In a regular morning meeting, President Sheinbaum said, "We have received news that this order will be issued. This order does not include any military people or groups taking action on our land."</p>
            <p>The Mexican Foreign Ministry later said that Mexico "will not accept the US military taking action on our land."</p>
            <p>Before this, the US Embassy in Mexico put out a statement. It said that both countries will use "all ways possible to protect our people" from drug gangs.</p>
            <p>The US Ambassador to Mexico, Ronald Johnson, wrote on the social media site X that both countries "face a common enemy: violent crime groups."</p>
            <p>The Pentagon suggested that questions about this order should be directed to the White House. The White House did not immediately say if the order was true.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that Trump's order makes it right to use military action against drug gangs at sea or in other countries.</p>
            <p>In February, the Trump government said that eight drug gangs were terrorist groups. Six of these groups were from Mexico, one from Venezuela, and one from El Salvador.</p>
            <p>Two weeks ago, the Trump government also named Venezuela's "Cartel of the Suns" as a terrorist group. This group has smuggled hundreds of tons of drugs into the United States over the last 20 years.</p>
