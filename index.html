            <h1>White House: Trump's Leg Swelling Due to Common Vein Problem</h1>
            <p>Photos of US President Trump's legs looking swollen and his hands looking bruised have been seen online. Today, a spokesperson for the White House said that Trump had a full health check. Doctors found he has a condition called "chronic venous insufficiency." This is a common and not serious problem for people over 70. The bruises on his hands are from shaking many hands and from taking aspirin.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, a White House spokesperson, spoke at a press conference today. She said that many people have been talking about Donald Trump's bruised hands and swollen legs lately. Trump wanted to share what his doctor said, to be open about it.</p>
            <p>At the press conference, Leavitt read the doctor's statement. She said that Trump had seen "a little swelling" in his lower legs in the past few weeks. So, the White House medical team checked it very carefully to be safe.</p>
            <p>She said Trump had a full check-up, including special tests for his blood vessels and a scan of his veins. The results showed he has "chronic venous insufficiency." She explained that this is "a harmless and common problem, especially for people over 70."</p>
            <p>She added that the tests did not find any blood clots in his veins or any problems with his arteries. Other related tests also showed no signs of heart problems, kidney problems, or other general body illnesses.</p>
            <p>Also, Leavitt said that recent pictures showed small bruises on the back of Trump's hands. These are because he shakes many hands, which can irritate the skin a little. They are also from him taking aspirin to help prevent heart problems.</p>
            <p>She said, "This is a normal and harmless effect of taking aspirin." She also said clearly that Trump "is in very good health."</p>
            <p>Trump is 79 years old, and his health has been talked about a lot recently. Fox News reported that photos of Trump's swollen legs were taken earlier this month when he was at a football match in New Jersey. This made people guess that Trump might be hiding health problems. Yesterday, he met the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, at the White House. Photos of his bruised hands also made people worried.</p>
            <p>The White House shared the results of Trump's yearly health check in April. His doctor said Trump was in "excellent" health and "completely able" to do his job as the leader.</p>
