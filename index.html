            <h1>Typhoon Willow Causes 14 Shipping Routes and 129 Sailings to Stop on August 13th</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, August 13th) Typhoon Willow is coming. The Maritime and Port Bureau said that today, 14 shipping routes with a total of 129 trips have stopped. Affected routes include Donggang-Xiaoliuqiu and Budai-Magong. The bureau asks people not to travel to outlying islands during the typhoon. This is to avoid getting stuck on the islands because boats stop running.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration continues to issue sea and land warnings for Medium Typhoon Willow. It is expected that Willow will land near Taitung around noon.</p>
            <p>Because the typhoon affects sea travel, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications Maritime and Port Bureau stated that today, 14 routes with a total of 129 trips have stopped.</p>
            <p>The affected routes are Keelung-Matsu, Nangan Fuao-Fuzhou Langqi, Beigan Baisha-Fuzhou Huangqi, Kinmen-Shijing, Kinmen-Wutong, Kaohsiung-Magong, Budai-Magong, Magong-Wangan-Qimei, Jiangjun-Dongji, Donggang-Xiaoliuqiu, Yanpu-Xiaoliuqiu, Fugang-Green Island, Fugang-Lanyu, and Houbihu-Lanyu.

            <h1>Police Officer Found Not Guilty After Shooting Fleeing Car and Accidentally Killing Passenger; Deceased's Aunt Sued for Threatening Judge</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, August 13th) A police officer shot at a car that refused to stop, and a passenger died. The passenger's aunt, a woman named Zhong, was unhappy that the case was finalized with a loss for them. She called and threatened to "kill" Judge Lin from the High Court. She also tried to force him to open the case again. Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office charged Ms. Zhong with forcing a public servant to act and threatening people's safety.</p>
            <p>Late at night on March 10, 2022, Officer Zhang Bo-yong from the Zhongyuan Police Station in New Taipei City was on patrol. He saw a Mercedes-Benz car with fake license plates and told it to stop. The driver, Mr. Lin, sped away. Officer Zhang chased him in his car. When Mr. Lin's car got stuck in traffic, Officer Zhang shot three times at the back of the car. He accidentally hit Mr. Zhong, who was in the back seat, in the head. Mr. Zhong died after being taken to the hospital. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office charged Officer Zhang with causing death by accident.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei District Court, in the first trial, decided that Officer Zhang was in an urgent situation when he used his weapon. His shots at the car were not more than needed. So, he was found not guilty. The Taiwan High Court kept this decision in the second trial. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal, so Officer Zhang's not guilty verdict is final.</p>
            <p>Based on the charges from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, Ms. Zhong, the aunt of the deceased Mr. Zhong, was unhappy that Officer Zhang was found not guilty. On the afternoon of November 15, 2024, she called the High Court. She told the clerk who answered the phone, "I have found gangsters and bought guns. The person I want to kill most is Judge Lin. I don't even want to kill the police officer who shot the gun the most." She also said, "I have seen a doctor, and I have a medical report. If I kill someone this way, will I not get the death penalty?" And, "If Judge Lin admits he made a mistake and starts a new trial, I can forgive him."</p>
            <p>Prosecutors believe that Ms. Zhong's words threatened Judge Lin's life and safety. These words could make the judge feel scared. She also used this to force him to open a new trial. Therefore, they believe she broke the law by forcing a public servant to act and threatening safety. She has been charged with these crimes, and the more serious charge of forcing a public servant to act will be used.</p>
