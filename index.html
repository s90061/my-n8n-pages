            <h1>US General Says: If Russia Doesn't Stop Fighting, US Should Increase Punishments</h1>
            <p>The US-Russia meeting will happen on August 15. A retired US general said today that US President Trump should tell Russian President Putin: if Russia does not stop fighting right away, the US will support more punishments for Russia and give Ukraine weapons to attack.</p>
            <p>The important meeting between the US and Russian leaders is planned for August 15 in Anchorage, Alaska. Trump said today that if Putin does not agree to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, Russia will face "very serious results." But he did not say what these results would be.</p>
            <p>Mark Montgomery, a retired US Navy general and a senior expert at a Washington group, spoke today. He said he hopes Trump understands that he needs to tell Putin how weak Russia is. He also said that if Russia does not stop fighting and announce a ceasefire immediately, the US will support more punishments for Russia and give Ukraine weapons for both attacking and defending.</p>
            <p>What does this meeting mean for Taiwan? Montgomery thinks that because Trump likes to make deals, Taiwan and all US friends should be a little careful with him.</p>
            <p>Montgomery said that for Taiwan, facing a much stronger China is a worry. But he added, "Taiwan already has many things to worry about." He advised Taiwan to keep building its strength, spend more money on defense, train with the US, try to make trade deals with the US, and invest a lot in the US. He said, "Try to be the best friend to the US as much as possible."</p>
            <p>TSMC has said it will invest more in the US, with total investments reaching 165 billion US dollars. Montgomery said this is a good start. Also, Taiwan buys almost all its military weapons from the US and wants to buy more. "These are good signs," he said. He hopes this will help make a deal so that the US tax on goods from Taiwan can go down from 20% to 15%, which is the same as for Japan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>He believes a trade deal between Taiwan and the US will most likely happen after the US and China announce a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. He hopes it happens "before the actual meeting."</p>
            <p>News reports before said that Trump's and China's President Xi Jinping's staff have been talking about a possible meeting when Trump visits Asia later this year. This might include Trump visiting China around the APEC meeting in South Korea, or a short meeting during the APEC meeting from October 30 to November 1. If this meeting happens, it will be the first time the two leaders meet since Trump returned to the White House.</p>

            <h1>800 Soldiers Sent to Washington D.C., Calls for it to Become the '51st State' Rise Again</h1>
            <p>Trump sent National Guard soldiers to Washington D.C. to keep the peace. This again showed that the capital, Washington D.C., is special and cannot control its own National Guard. This has brought back talks about D.C. becoming a state. For many decades, D.C. becoming a state has not happened. This is because of many reasons and a power struggle between the two main political parties in Congress.</p>
            <p>US President Trump decided on August 11 that the District of Columbia (D.C., the official name for Washington D.C.) police department would be directly controlled by the central government. He also sent about 800 National Guard soldiers. Starting last night, people living in D.C. shared photos on social media of National Guard soldiers walking in the streets or law enforcement officers.</p>
            <p>When the President directly sends National Guard soldiers, it shows that the local government has less power. Also, D.C. residents pay federal taxes but cannot vote in Congress. All these things that make D.C. "less than a state" have made talks about D.C. becoming a state grow faster overnight.</p>
            <p>People who support statehood think that if D.C. becomes a state, it can protect itself from Trump's control. The city government also would not have to worry about being completely taken over. Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of D.C., brought the "statehood" issue into public view on August 11. She said that she and people before her have worked to support this for many years.</p>
            <p>For many decades, the closest D.C. got to being a state was in 2021. At that time, the House of Representatives approved a law to make D.C. the 51st state. But the law was not voted on in the Senate.</p>
            <p>D.C. has been seen as a strong Democratic voting area for a long time. If it becomes a state, it would add two Senate seats for the Democratic Party. This would also help the Democratic Party get more power in the Senate in the future. Now that the Republican Party controls Congress, the chance for D.C. to become the 51st state is likely even smaller.</p>
            <p>Also, not all Democrats fully support D.C. becoming a state. Some worry that people in the middle might see it as a political action just for one party's benefit. They worry it might make people less interested and think it's not right, so they did not vote for it.</p>
            <p>The reason D.C. was made a "district" and not a "state" goes back to when the 13 US states first formed a country and were learning to work together. They needed a fair area to handle matters for the central government.</p>
            <p>In 1790, the US Congress passed the Capital Act. This law decided to choose a piece of land along the Potomac River to be the permanent capital. The next year, it was named the "District of Columbia."</p>
            <p>D.C. residents could only vote for president after 1961 because of a change to the Constitution. In 1973, because of the "Home Rule Law," D.C. was ruled by an elected government, and Congress only watched over it. But the Home Rule Law does not mean the local government can do whatever it wants; there are still limits. Trump used Article 740 on August 11, which lets the President temporarily take control of the police department if he decides there is a "special urgent situation."</p>
            <p>"We do not have complete independence," Mayor Bowser said at a press conference on August 11.</p>
            <p>If D.C. really "moves up," the plan is for it to become the 51st state under the name "State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth." This name would honor Frederick Douglass, an important person who worked to end slavery for Black people.</p>
            <p>The original federal district would become much smaller, only about 2 square miles (about 5.17 square kilometers). It would only include the White House, the US Capitol building, the US Supreme Court, and the government buildings next to the Capitol and National Mall. The rest of the area, about 66 square miles, would belong to the 51st state.</p>
            <p>D.C. would also choose 2 senators and 1 representative who can vote.</p>
            <p>Those who support statehood say that D.C. becoming a state would fix a mistake from history. It would make sure that voters have proper representation. Those against it say D.C. is too small. If it became a state, it might have too much power over the central government.</p>
            <p>What does President Trump think? He said today, "(D.C. becoming a) state is silly."</p>

            <h1>Ukraine and Europe Agree on Rules for Talks Before US-Russia Meeting: Can Talk About Land, But Not Ukraine's Control Over It</h1>
            <p>The US-Russia meeting will happen on August 15 in Alaska. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, who cannot be there, said today that he and European and US leaders have agreed on 5 main rules for the coming US-Russia meeting. The biggest step forward is that Ukraine is ready to talk about land issues. But this can only be based on where the fighting is happening now. He also said strongly that Ukraine will not agree to Russia having control over any Ukrainian land.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy was in Berlin and had an online meeting with US President Trump, and leaders from many European countries like the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Finland. Also, the head of NATO, Mark Rutte, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the head of the European Council, AntÃ³nio Costa, were in the meeting.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held a press conference together. Merz announced that everyone in the meeting agreed on 5 main rules for the upcoming US-Russia meeting. One rule is that Ukraine has said it is willing to talk about land problems. But this talk must only start from the "contact point," which means the current fighting line. Ukraine also said again that it will not agree to any areas taken by Russia being Russian land, and Ukraine's official borders will stay the same.</p>
            <p>Other agreements include: from now on, any talks about Ukraine must include Ukraine; stopping the fighting right away must be the first topic in talks; later talks need to include plans for Ukraine's safety, like Western countries helping Ukraine keep its ability to defend itself; also, talks must happen with all countries on both sides of the Atlantic agreeing together. If Russia refuses to stop fighting on August 15, Europe and the US will think about adding more punishments.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that Russia should not have the power to say no to Ukraine joining NATO and the EU. He also said again that he hopes to have a meeting with three people: him, Trump, and Russian President Putin.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked more about Ukraine's land position, Zelenskyy said again that Ukraine will not take its soldiers out of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He said strongly that all talks about Ukraine can only happen with Ukraine itself. He also said that Ukraine's law clearly states that it does not agree to Russia having control over any Ukrainian land.</p>
            <p>Speaking about the coming US-Russia meeting, Zelenskyy said: "We hope the main topic of the meeting will be an immediate stop to the fighting. The US President has said many times that after the Alaska meeting, he will talk directly with me to discuss what happened and decide what to do next."</p>
            <p>Also, Zelenskyy said that Russian President Putin has been "showing off strength" recently. He is trying to put more pressure on all fighting lines before the meeting. He wants to make it seem like Russia can take all of Ukraine. "Putin does not want peace; he just wants to take our country," Zelenskyy continued. He added that the punishments have damaged Russia's economy badly. He asked other countries to keep putting pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>Trump is planning to meet Putin in person on August 15 in Anchorage, Alaska. This will be the first time a US President meets Putin in a summit since 2021.</p>
            <p>News reports before said that Putin might suggest a plan to stop the fighting. This plan would have Ukrainian soldiers leave the Donbas region, and the current fighting lines would be the basis for who controls what in southern Ukraine. Zelenskyy has said many times before that he will not give up an inch of land that Ukraine has control over.</p>
