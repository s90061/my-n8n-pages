            <h1>Taichung City Manages All 260,000 Streetlights to Fix Them Faster</h1>
            <p>Taichung City has now put all of its streetlights under one system. This change started this year. Now, the Public Works Office, which is part of the city's Construction Bureau, will take care of all streetlights. It does not matter who put them there before. There are about 268,000 streetlights listed. The city is adding a special system to find where each streetlight is. If you tell them the streetlight's number, workers can go and fix it quickly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shi Zhichang, a city council member, held a meeting today. He talked about how streetlights are kept in the Daan area. Mr. Shi said that last year, he told the city council that Taichung had a long-standing problem. Different parts of the city (the old county and the old city) had different ways to manage streetlights. This made repairs slow. He suggested that the Construction Bureau should manage all streetlights. This would help keep people safe on the roads.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shi explained that in the past, many streetlights in the old Taichung County were put up by local town offices. The city did not have full information about them. So, some streetlights were not managed well. They started to list them in a system only after 2014. But still, there was not enough information to find where they were. If a typhoon or other natural disaster broke them, they could not be fixed quickly. Village leaders had to check them, which was not an efficient way to work.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Binghuang, the head of Nanzhuang Village in Daan District, said that since this year, some streetlights are being fixed much faster. But in a few cases, people reported problems many times, and nothing happened. He hopes the city government will truly make repairs quicker.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hong Zhiwen, a boss at the Public Works Office, said that from this year, his office will take care of all streetlights in Taichung City. This includes streetlights set up by city departments or those that get electricity from Taipower. There are about 268,000 streetlights listed. They will all get new name tags with a number and a phone number to call. They are also slowly putting GPS systems on them. In the future, people just need to give the streetlight's number, and workers will be sent quickly to fix it.</p>

            <h1>All-Fortune Bio-tech Shares Good News About 4 New Drugs</h1>
            <p>Mr. Lin Chun, the head of All-Fortune Bio-tech, said that his company is working faster to create new medicines. Two new medicines, one for dry eyes and one for a problem called neurotrophic keratitis, have shown good progress. Big drug companies from other countries are now talking about working with All-Fortune Bio-tech. The company is changing how it works. It used to just make drugs by itself. Now, it will also work with other companies and buy other companies to grow faster.</p>
            <p>Today, All-Fortune Bio-tech met with people who invest in companies. Mr. Lin Chun led the meeting. He talked about the latest good results from their research and their plans for the future. The company has new eye medicines. These include medicines for dry eyes, neurotrophic keratitis, glaucoma, and a new type of medicine that stops new blood vessels from growing too much. All these medicines have made progress recently.</p>
            <p>For the dry eye medicine, which is very important to All-Fortune, they have made the medicine work better. The government in Taiwan recently said they can start the second stage of testing this medicine on people. This test will help them find the right amount of medicine to use. They plan to start finding people for this test in the last three months of the year. They also plan to ask the U.S. FDA to allow them to start the third stage of testing. The new medicine for neurotrophic keratitis has already shown good results in the second stage of testing in America and Brazil.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin Chun said that they are currently talking with other drug companies about letting them sell the dry eye medicine and the neurotrophic keratitis medicine.</p>
            <p>Also, the new glaucoma medicine has been approved by the Taiwan government. It can now start the first and second stages of testing on people. They will begin to find patients soon. The new medicine that stops blood vessel growth in the eye has also been improved. The company plans to talk to the U.S. FDA about it. They hope it will be the first medicine of its kind in the world.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, All-Fortune Bio-tech announced today that they will work together with Acelure Medical Inc. to develop new things. They will focus on new ways to treat eye problems and arthritis using special methods. Mr. Lin Chun said they will first try to combine different treatments using their current medicines.</p>
            <p>At the same time, All-Fortune Bio-tech said on September 1st that it will invest in Compas Bioinformation. This is to help them make new medicines for very specific health problems. It is also to follow new rules from the FDA about how to check new medicines. This investment will help them learn more about genes for special treatments and use AI to make new medicines faster.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin Chun said he hopes that Compas Bioinformation's skills in making AI software for gene tests and its information about patients in Asia will help All-Fortune. Their existing hospitals and research groups will also help All-Fortune move faster in making special treatments and new medicines.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Police Officer and Friend Charged for Illegally Checking Personal Information</h1>
            <p>A police officer named Chen from the Fengyuan police station in Taichung City is in trouble. He is accused of using his job to help his friend, a woman named Wang. He checked other people's police records and private information for her without permission. He also gave Wang the personal details of people who had been tricked in money scams. After an investigation, the police have charged Chen and Wang with breaking laws about keeping personal information private.</p>
            <p>The official document from the Taichung court says that Mr. Chen worked as a police officer at the Dingjie Police Station from September 2020 to February 2025. He met Ms. Wang because they both put money into online currencies, and they became friends on the LINE app.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wang had an argument with a man also named Wang. In July and November of 2022, she asked Mr. Chen to check if this man had been arrested before or was wanted by the police. Mr. Chen used another police officer's login to get into the police computer system. He found the man's police record, car information, and other private details. Then, he sent this information to Ms. Wang.</p>
            <p>Also, five people went to the police station to report that they were tricked in online money scams. After the police took their reports, they wrote a short summary of the cases. They shared this summary in a police work chat group on LINE. Mr. Chen was in this group and saw the information. He then sent the victims' private information to Ms. Wang using LINE.</p>
            <p>The National Police Agency looked into the case first. Then, they sent Mr. Chen to the Taichung court for more investigation. After checking everything, with what witnesses said and the chat messages from LINE, the Taichung court has charged Mr. Chen and Ms. Wang. They are charged with breaking laws that protect people's private information and other related crimes.</p>
