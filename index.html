            <h1>DPP Says Mayor Lu Shiow-yen Left Taiwan's Biggest Trash Pile; Taichung City Says Landfill Not Full</h1>
            <p>The media recently reported that the Dali landfill was completely full, causing problems for citizens. Cho Kuan-ting, a spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said today that Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen has not been seen for a long time. He stated that she has left Taiwan's largest trash pile after her eight years as mayor. The Taichung Environmental Protection Bureau replied that the landfill follows environmental rules and is not full. They added that when the incinerators finish their yearly repairs, the trash can be moved back to be burned.</p>
            <p>DPP spokespersons Wu Cheng and Cho Kuan-ting held a press conference this morning. Cho Kuan-ting explained that on September 1st, the media showed that the Dali landfill was full. After this, the DPP's group in the Taichung City Council held more press conferences. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen has not shown up for 7 days and has not answered any questions.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting also said that before the previous Taichung Mayor, Lin Chia-lung, left his job, the Dali landfill only had 7,000 tons of trash. In 2019, which was Lu Shiow-yen's first year as mayor, the amount reached 37,000 tons. This year, it is full with 340,000 tons. This amount makes up 40% of all the trash left out in the open in Taiwan's 22 cities and counties.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting pointed out that in 2018, when Lin Chia-lung was mayor, a budget of NT$1 billion was already put aside to make the Wenshan incinerator better. At that time, it was planned to be finished by 2021. If Mayor Lu Shiow-yen had continued this plan when she took office, the trash problem could have been solved easily. However, it is a shame that after she became mayor, she changed the previous government's plan. She said she wanted to use a BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) method. The cost of the project then went up a lot, to NT$8.5 billion. After her eight years in office, she has left Taiwan's biggest trash pile.</p>
            <p>Wu Cheng stated that audit reports have been warning year after year that Taichung's incinerators cannot handle enough trash, and the landfills are also too small. Taichung's three incinerators are old and need to be replaced. But because Mayor Lu Shiow-yen kept changing her mind between ROT (Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer) and BOT plans, the Wenshan incinerator only started looking for companies to work with this year. It is expected to be finished in 2032.</p>
            <p>In response, the Taichung Environmental Protection Bureau said that the Dali landfill strictly follows environmental rules and is not full. It is used as one of the temporary places to put trash when the incinerators have their yearly repairs. When the incinerators are working again, the trash from the landfill can be moved back to be burned. This means trash goes in and out.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau also said that they started moving trash from the Dali landfill back to the incinerator storage areas in 2023. Even the Minister of Environment, Peng Chi-ming, visited and confirmed that the trash was being handled well. The landfill was not listed in national meetings as having exposed trash problems.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau explained that to deal with household trash faster, they are not only replacing old incinerators with new ones to burn more trash but also temporarily moving some trash to landfills. While making sure to follow environmental rules, they cover the trash with recycled ash from burning or with nets to stop bad smells and prevent it from spreading. This helps to make sure the environment nearby is not harmed. This information is from September 8, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Three-Story House in Luzhou, New Taipei, Collapses During Demolition, Crushing Scaffolding; No Injuries</h1>
            <p>A three-story house in an alley on Guanghua Road in Luzhou District, New Taipei City, was being taken down. But suddenly, the third-floor ceiling fell down and crushed the scaffolding. Luckily, no one was hurt or stuck when it happened. The Public Works Department has been asked to send people to the site to find out the exact reason for the collapse.</p>
            <p>The Luzhou Police Station in New Taipei sent a message explaining what happened. Today, around 10 AM, the ceiling of a three-story house that was being torn down suddenly fell. Dirt and dust filled the air, and the scaffolding and electric wires were pushed down.</p>
            <p>The police stated that after they received the report, they sent officers to block off the area to keep everyone safe. After checking with the construction company, they confirmed that no one was trapped or injured at the place. Zhong Yao-lei, the head of the Luzhou District Office, also came to see what happened. He told the Public Works Department to send staff to the site to check the situation. This will help them understand why the collapse happened and decide what to do next. This information is from September 8, 2025.</p>
