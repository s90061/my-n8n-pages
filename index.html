            <h1>Dog Seriously Hurt After Being Dragged by Car; Owner Fined and Blacklisted</h1>
            <p>In Taishan District, New Taipei City, some people recently saw a dog being dragged by a moving car. The owner later said it was an accident caused by not paying attention. Today, the New Taipei Animal Protection and Health Office (APHO) announced that they will fine the owner NT$75,000. They will also take the dog away and put the owner on a list so they can never own a dog or cat again.</p>
            <p>The APHO said in a press release that on July 27, around 4:10 PM, a car in Taishan District was moving with a dog tied to its back. People saw this and quickly stopped the car. The driver then realized the dog was being dragged. The APHO received the report and quickly checked the car's information. Working with the police, they contacted the owner. The owner confirmed that the dog had already received medicine and was sent to a hospital for animals that is open 24 hours.</p>
            <p>A vet checked the dog and said its four legs and stomach were badly hurt from rubbing on the ground. Some of the wounds were very deep, reaching the muscles, and some bones were even visible. The dog needs to stay in the hospital for more medicine and to be watched closely. If the wounds are not taken care of well, the dog might get a serious infection that could lead to losing a leg.</p>
            <p>The owner said that when they left home, they did not see that a family member had tied the dog to the back of the car. They said it was completely a mistake and added, "I am usually very kind to it, I really did not do it on purpose."</p>
            <p>The APHO explained that according to Animal Protection Law, Article 5, Paragraph 2, owners must give their animals proper, clean, safe food and living space. Also, it is against the law to pull pets with a car or motorcycle. If an animal is hurt due to carelessness, causing serious injury, loss of important body parts, or death, the owner can be fined between NT$15,000 and NT$75,000, according to Article 30, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the same law.</p>
            <p>The APHO stated that this case is very serious. They will fine the owner the highest amount, NT$75,000. They will also take the dog away, put the owner on a permanent blacklist so they can never own a dog or cat again, and make the owner attend classes about animal protection.</p>
