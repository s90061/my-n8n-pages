            <h1>Experts Believe Taiwan and US Will Agree Before August 7th on New Tariffs</h1>
            <p>On July 31st, US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs that will start on August 7th. These tariffs will add a 20% tax on goods from Taiwan. However, talks between Taiwan and the US are still happening. Some international experts think that Taiwan or India might reach an agreement within the 7-day period given.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Trump often sets deadlines for trade but then changes or extends them. This has led to the saying, "Trump always backs down." But experts believe he will not change his mind this time.</p>
            <p>Matthew Aks, a policy expert at Evercore ISI, said he does not expect big changes to the new order. However, he thinks some economies like Taiwan or India might finish their deals within the 7-day period.</p>
            <p>Josh Lipsky, an international economics expert from the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington D.C., also believes Trump is not backing down. He says Trump is "doing what he promised, and even more" about tariffs during his election campaign.</p>
            <p>Before announcing the latest tariffs, Trump had difficult talks and made several agreements. The most important ones were with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. Trump set different tariff rates for them and said the US would get large investments.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te wrote on Facebook that the US balanced tariff policy had a good result that day, after the US government informed Taiwan. The tariff rate was lowered from 32% to 20%. But because the final meeting has not happened, the final rate is not set yet. This is why the 20% tariff is "temporary."</p>
            <p>Deputy Premier Cheng Li-chun and her team recently had another round of talks in Washington D.C. about the new US tariffs. She returned to Taiwan this morning and said, "The talks must continue. We will keep working hard to get a better tariff rate."</p>

            <h1>Financial Companies' Money in Other Countries Drops to NT$27 Trillion, Biggest Decrease in One Quarter</h1>
            <p>According to the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), by the end of the second quarter, Taiwanese financial holding groups had NT$27.02 trillion invested or exposed to risks overseas. Because the New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger in the second quarter, the amount of money overseas dropped by NT$2.09 trillion in just one quarter. This is a 7.2% decrease and the biggest drop since the data collection started in 2015. The United States is still the country where Taiwanese financial groups have the most money, with NT$9.56 trillion. This amount is now 35.39% of all overseas exposure.</p>
            <p>Since the second quarter of 2015, the FSC has been sharing quarterly data on how much money financial groups have invested or risked, both in Taiwan and overseas. This includes money lent to other banks, loans, and total investments.</p>
            <p>In the first quarter of this year, the total overseas exposure of financial holding groups reached an all-time high of NT$29.12 trillion. However, when overseas investments, which are in US dollars, are changed to New Taiwan Dollars, the strong increase of the New Taiwan Dollar by 10.97% in the second quarter also affected these numbers.</p>
            <p>The FSC's data shows that by the end of the second quarter, financial groups' overseas exposure went down to NT$27.02 trillion, a large decrease of NT$2.09 trillion in one quarter. However, the total money financial groups have invested in Taiwan continued to rise to NT$47.56 trillion, an increase of NT$1.12 trillion from the previous quarter. The total money invested both in Taiwan and overseas is NT$74.587971 trillion, which is NT$974.503 billion less than the previous quarter.</p>
            <p>The top 10 countries or regions where Taiwanese financial groups have invested or are exposed to risk are the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. Compared to the first quarter, only Japan saw an increase in exposure, while other countries saw a decrease.</p>
            <p>The United States still has the largest exposure with NT$9.5635 trillion. However, the amount of money financial groups have in the US dropped below NT$10 trillion, with a large decrease of NT$792.3 billion in one quarter. This is the biggest drop in exposure to the US in a single quarter. The US share of total overseas exposure also slightly decreased from 35.56% to 35.39%. Compared to the first quarter of this year, both loans and investments went down, but currency exchange rates also played a role.</p>
            <p>China is still the second-largest country for financial groups' overseas exposure. By the end of the second quarter, financial groups' exposure to China was NT$1.8958 trillion. This is the lowest it has been since records began, falling below NT$2 trillion for the first time, with a quarterly decrease of NT$149.9 billion. Looking at the reasons for this change, net investments, net loans, and money lent between banks all decreased.</p>
            <p>Among the top 10 countries for overseas exposure, financial groups' exposure to Japan was NT$1.1279 trillion, an increase of NT$12.309 billion from the previous quarter. This was mainly due to an increase in net investments. Because of this, Japan moved up to the 6th position, passing South Korea. Financial groups' exposure to South Korea was NT$1.0731 trillion, placing it 7th, with a quarterly decrease of NT$52.536 billion.</p>
