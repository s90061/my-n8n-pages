            <h1>Night Market Conflict: Taichung Police Arrest 3, Find Missing Migrant Workers and Illegal Employer</h1>
            <p>A Vietnamese man named Wei was eating at Hanhsi Night Market in Taichung. He argued with another person from his country. He then joined two friends to hit the person. They ran away. Police followed clues and arrested the three people in Dali District. They also found an employer and two migrant workers who were missing. Everyone was sent to the authorities and the National Immigration Agency.</p>
            <p>Today, the Third Branch of the Taichung City Police Department said that on September 6th, Dongxin Police Station received a report about many people fighting at the night market. But when the police arrived, everyone involved had already left.</p>
            <p>The police formed a special team. They watched surveillance videos to find the cars. On September 10th, they saw the suspects in Dali. Officers went to the area. They found Mr. Wei and his friends going home in a car driven by an employer named Jiang. The police stopped the car right away and arrested all three people involved.</p>
            <p>Police found that Mr. Wei was likely bumped into by the Vietnamese victim while eating. He became angry. So, he and his friends, Mr. Tai and Mr. Zhou, who are also from Vietnam, hit the victim. This caused things like cups in the shop to break.</p>
            <p>When police arrested Mr. Wei, they found two missing migrant workers, Mr. Pei and Ms. Deng, who are also Vietnamese, in the car. After questioning, Mr. Wei and his two friends were sent to the Taiwan Taichung District Prosecutor's Office. They are charged with fighting in a group, which is against the law. The missing migrant workers were sent to the National Immigration Agency. Police are still looking for the victim.</p>
            <p>Also, the employer, Mr. Jiang, gave jobs to workers who were not allowed to work. He will be reported to the Taichung City Labor Bureau for breaking the Employment Service Act. He will then face punishment.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Education Gives "Xingtan Fenfang Award" to Encourage Teachers</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education held an award ceremony today in Nantou County for the "Xingtan Fenfang Award." The K-12 Education Administration said that many teachers work hard without being noticed. They use their passion and actions to help students grow. The ministry hopes these awards will show great respect and encourage more teachers to continue their good work.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Education's K-12 Education Administration held the "Xingtan Fenfang Award" ceremony at National Chung Hsing Senior High School. A total of 65 teachers and 10 groups received awards. Peng Fu-yuan, the head of the K-12 Education Administration, said that everyone who was nominated has touching stories and important achievements. They are examples for others in education. Being nominated is a big honor. He hopes the awards will inspire more educators to stick to their original goals and try new things.</p>
            <p>The K-12 Education Administration announced in a press release that Lin Jin-hua, who works as an administrative manager at Taichung Dali Senior High School, is not a classroom teacher. But for many years, she has protected students. She actively helps students in need and assists athletes with school funding. She is a strong supporter for the children. She also got special licenses to help make schools more accessible for people with disabilities. She acts like a "godmother" to students, helping them with everything from training to emotional support.</p>
            <p>The K-12 Education Administration said that Hsu Rui-hua, a director at National Guanshan Industrial and Commercial High School, has worked in rural areas for 42 years. She has visited homes in 16 towns, going over mountains and by the sea. She never gives up on any student. Once, a student had mental difficulties and could not go to class. Hsu Rui-hua talked to the student many times, visited their home, and worked with different experts. She helped the student return to school and go to college. Hsu Rui-hua uses her love and hard work to protect the hopes of every child.</p>
            <p>Li Hong-wen, a director at Zaixing Elementary School in Pingtung County, brightens students' lives with love and patience. Twenty years ago, he encouraged a little girl who felt bad about her family's situation. He told her, "You will become an amazing person." Many years later, this girl became an elementary school teacher. She wrote a letter to thank Li Hong-wen for his encouragement, which started her dream. This teacher-student friendship, lasting over 20 years, shows the warmth of education very well.</p>
            <p>Wu Xiao-fang, a teacher at National Hemei Experimental School, has worked quietly for 35 years. She helps students with their schoolwork for free and stays with them during night study. For students with physical disabilities and poor eyesight, she made special 3D learning tools. This opened a new way for them to learn by touch. Wu Xiao-fang also started the "Yingxi Arts Camp." She used the "Pygmalion effect" to help students find their hidden talents. This helped children who felt hopeless gain confidence again and achieve their dreams.</p>
            <p>The K-12 Education Administration also said that the "Shadow Legend Troupe," which won a group award, was started by Xiao Ru-xun. Three generations of his family have worked together. For 20 years, they have been at Taipei Dali Elementary School. They work hard to turn shadow puppetry into lessons that are both educational and artistic. The troupe mixes fairy tales, cartoons, and different languages. They also invented puppets and stages that have national patents. This breaks old rules and brings new life to shadow puppetry. It also helps students change from just watching to creating, from working behind the scenes to performing on stage, and even to performing internationally.</p>

            <h1>Military Industry Stocks Fall After Big Gains; Thunder Tiger, Lungteh Shipbuilding Drop Below Average Price</h1>
            <p>Stocks related to military industry and drones have risen a lot in the third quarter. This was because of good government policies. Today, as TSMC helped Taiwan stocks reach a new high, military industry stocks fell. This happened because investors wanted to sell and take their profits quickly. Companies like Thunder Tiger and Lungteh Shipbuilding reached their highest prices ever in the morning. But then they fell. By the end of the day, Thunder Tiger fell by 5.05% and Lungteh Shipbuilding fell by 9.34%. Both stocks went below their 5-day average price.</p>
            <p>The Taipei International Aerospace and Defense Industry Exhibition will start on September 18th. This has made drone and unmanned boat stocks more popular recently. Thunder Tiger and Lungteh Shipbuilding both reached new record prices of NT$191 and NT$214 after the market opened today. However, because their profits were so big, many investors sold their shares to take their earnings.</p>
            <p>Thunder Tiger's stock opened at a new high of NT$191 today. This was 2.07 times higher than its lowest point of NT$62.2 on July 22nd. By the end of trading, it closed at NT$178.5, a big fall of 5.05%. It went below its 5-day average price of NT$180.7.</p>
            <p>Another drone stock, Coretronic, reached its highest price of NT$141 on September 4th. This was more than 1.55 times higher than its lowest price of NT$55.2 on July 4th, in just two months. Today, it closed at NT$112.5, falling sharply by 6.49%.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense announced before that it would start buying nearly 50,000 military-grade drones made for commercial use. The total cost could be up to NT$50 billion. This is Taiwan's largest drone purchase ever. It has caused all drone and military industry stocks to rise a lot.</p>
            <p>Thunder Tiger Technology recently said it would show a new 6-meter-long "SeaShark 600 Stealth (600S)" unmanned surface vessel (USV) at the Taipei International Aerospace and Defense Industry Exhibition (TADTE). This vessel is a "suicide drone" for water. The company hopes to get a big order from the Ministry of National Defense, which plans to buy over 1,300 unmanned boats. This purchase could be worth tens of billions of NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Lungteh Shipbuilding, a company making unmanned boats, reached a new record high of NT$214 in early trading today. Since August 22nd, when its price was NT$115, it had risen by a large 86%. Today, investors sold their shares to take profits. The stock closed at NT$184.5, falling by 9.34% in one day. Other important aerospace and military industry stocks, AIDC and Evergreen Aviation Technologies, also fell today. AIDC dropped by 5.51% and Evergreen Aviation Technologies by 2.06%. Both fell below their 10-day average prices.</p>
