            <h1>Trump's Son Plans September Visit to Japan for Crypto Business</h1>
            <p>Eric Trump, the second son of U.S. President Trump, is planning to visit Tokyo in September. He will attend a meeting for shareholders of a Japanese company that holds Bitcoin. This visit is part of the Trump family's efforts to grow their cryptocurrency business.</p>
            <p>Sources who did not want to be named said that Eric Trump will go to the shareholder meeting of Metaplanet Inc. on September 1. Metaplanet is a Japanese company that holds Bitcoin.</p>
            <p>Metaplanet used to be a hotel company. In early 2024, it changed to a company that holds Bitcoin. Now, it owns Bitcoin worth more than 2.1 billion U.S. dollars (about 64.2 billion New Taiwan dollars). In March this year, the company hired Eric Trump to be a special advisor for its business plans.</p>
            <p>After Bloomberg reported this news, Metaplanet's shares in Tokyo stopped falling and went up by 2.1% today.</p>
            <p>The company's stock price has changed a lot. It has dropped by half since its highest point in mid-June. However, over the past 12 months, its value has increased by almost eight times.</p>
            <p>Before going to Tokyo, Eric Trump will be in Hong Kong from August 28 to 29 for the Bitcoin Asia forum. During the Metaplanet shareholder meeting, shareholders will vote on new ways to get money for the company.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry Budget to Reach NT$41.5 Billion, Focusing on "Glorious Nation Plan"</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 22 â€“ The government has approved the budget for the central government for the year 2026. A foreign affairs official said today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) budget for 2026 will be about NT$41.5 billion. This is NT$10.9 billion more than this year's budget. The official stated that MOFA will use this money to carry out the "Glorious Nation Plan" with countries that are Taiwan's allies and with other countries that share similar ideas.</p>
            <p>The official explained that the budget increase of NT$10.9 billion brings the total to NT$41.5 billion. This is a 35.7% increase from this year's NT$30.5 billion. However, this amount only brings the budget back to the level it was in 2021. The official noted that China's diplomatic budget is eight times larger than Taiwan's. China is spending a lot more on diplomacy, so Taiwan needs to improve its own diplomatic efforts to respond. Because of this, President Lai Ching-te and the government have supported a larger budget for foreign affairs.</p>
            <p>The official also said that China has a lot of money for its diplomatic efforts. China uses its large economy to pressure Taiwan's allies, trying to limit Taiwan's international space and growth. In recent years, the world's political situation has changed, and supply chains are being rebuilt. Many countries are now seeing how China uses economic pressure to hurt democratic values. This has led countries with similar ideas to react. They are actively building "non-red supply chains," especially in technology. Also, if former U.S. President Trump returns to power, "economic diplomacy" will become a very important topic in international relations.</p>
            <p>The official stated that MOFA is responding to these international changes. With support from President Lai and the government, MOFA has created an "Executive Yuan Economic Diplomacy Task Force." This group is actively promoting the "Glorious Nation Plan" with allied countries, countries that share similar ideas, and countries that have the same strategic interests as Taiwan. Through real cooperation, Taiwan will also share its strong industries to create new business opportunities.</p>
            <p>The official explained that after Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung started his job, he used "economic diplomacy" to make relations with allied countries stronger. He also successfully helped Taiwan citizens get visa-free travel to countries like Thailand. MOFA will continue to work with allied and like-minded countries to develop regional and international relationships, helping Taiwan to expand its reach.</p>
            <p>The foreign affairs official added that about NT$6.8 billion of the extra NT$10.9 billion in MOFA's budget will be used for the "Glorious Nation Plan." MOFA will continue to work closely with friendly countries in areas like strong semiconductor supply chains, trustworthy digital governance, smart industrial parks overseas, new energy and carbon credit cooperation, smart medical care, smart agriculture, lasting tourism, and national AI. This real cooperation will help Taiwan expand its diplomatic space.</p>
            <p>In addition, about NT$3 billion will be added to the International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF). This will gradually bring the fund back to its original approved amount of NT$30 billion when it was first created. This will make Taiwan better at international development, investment, and aid, making Taiwan's relationships with partner countries stronger. Also, more money, about NT$800 million, will be added for international exchange events and welcoming foreign guests. This is because more important foreign visitors are coming to Taiwan, and Taiwan needs to take part in more international meetings and exchanges. This will help Taiwan connect more with the world and make its real cooperation with like-minded countries stronger.</p>

            <h1>7.5 Magnitude Earthquake in Drake Passage; Tsunami Threat Is Over</h1>
            <p>Buenos Aires, August 21 â€“ A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 happened today in the Drake Passage. This is a body of water located between the southern part of South America and Antarctica. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported this event. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) later announced that there is no longer a threat of a tsunami.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that earlier, officials in Chile had issued a tsunami warning for some areas near Antarctica. However, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) then said that the tsunami threat had ended. There were no immediate orders for people to leave their homes in Chile or Argentina, which are countries close to where the earthquake happened.</p>
            <p>According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake happened at 11:16 PM on August 21, Argentina time (10:16 AM on August 22, Taiwan time). The center of the earthquake was in the Drake Passage, about 710 kilometers southeast of Ushuaia, a city in Argentina. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10.8 kilometers.</p>
            <p>The Drake Passage is a remote area that connects the South Atlantic Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean, located between the southern tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. So far, there have been no reports of anyone being hurt.</p>
            <p>Even though the Drake Passage does not have as many earthquakes as other coastal areas in Chile, it is located across an area with a lot of earthquake activity and important geological features.</p>
