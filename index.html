            <h1>Akio Toyoda: Taiwan Can Develop Racing Culture; Hydrogen Cars Represent the Future</h1>
            <p>Akio Toyoda, the chairman of TOYOTA, said today that Taiwan has a good chance to develop its racing culture. He mentioned that Taiwan's racing events and fans have been "waiting for a long time." When he talked about the future of hydrogen-powered cars, Toyoda said that these cars are the future and will have many uses. The TOYOTA group wants to work with its suppliers to create these hydrogen cars for the future.</p>
            <p>The TOYOTA GAZOO Racing Corolla Cup 2025 race continued today in Taichung, and Akio Toyoda was there again. During a media interview, he spoke about Taiwan's racing culture. Toyoda believes that racing culture in Taiwan and other Asian areas will grow stronger. He saw how excited people in Taiwan were for this event, which shows that racing fans and events in Taiwan have been "waiting for a long time."</p>
            <p>Akio Toyoda also said that besides track races, Taiwan could try other events like endurance races in the future. Taiwan could also work with top Japanese drivers to compete on the world stage.</p>
            <p>Toyoda explained that car companies alone cannot build a strong racing culture. Society needs to work together to improve facilities and support. This will help the racing culture grow and train more racing talents. Data from races can also encourage car companies to make newer cars with better performance.</p>
            <p>When asked why he visits Taiwan often, Akio Toyoda said he used to be the head of Toyota Asia and visited many Asian countries, including Taiwan. He feels a special connection to Taiwan. He joked that he was "a bit surprised" by how many people paid to attend this event and how much attention it received.</p>
            <p>Akio Toyoda also said that as the chairman of a big international car company, some people might ask why he opens new sales points or shops in different places. Toyoda replied that besides being the chairman, he is also MORIZO, a racer who loves cars very much. MORIZO is the name Akio Toyoda uses when he takes part in racing events.</p>
            <p>Speaking about the future of hydrogen fuel cars, Akio Toyoda stated that these cars will have many uses in the future. From a racer's perspective, hydrogen cars represent what is coming next.</p>
            <p>He explained that building a car engine involves tens of thousands of parts, requiring many companies to work together. However, electric cars might not need a third of these parts, which could affect the jobs of workers in a third of the car parts factories.</p>
            <p>Akio Toyoda mentioned he is thinking of a way for hydrogen fuel cars to work with parts suppliers. He believes that car manufacturers (OEMs) and various small car parts companies are all very important for the car industry. He hopes to work with the supply chain to build hydrogen energy cars for the future.</p>

            <h1>City God Cultural Association Collects Money for 20,000 Lunchboxes, 7,500 Already Sent to Hualien</h1>
            <p>A dam on the Matai'an River in Hualien overflowed, causing serious damage to Guangfu Township. The Chinese City God Cultural Association collected enough money for 20,000 lunchboxes. They asked restaurants in Hualien City to make these lunchboxes and send them to the affected area. In the past three days, they have already sent 7,500 lunchboxes. They will continue to provide necessary help to the disaster area as needed.</p>
            <p>According to the Hualien County Government, this disaster has caused 17 deaths, 110 injuries, and 7 people are still missing. The downtown area of Guangfu Township and many other places are covered in a thick layer of black mud. Many people volunteered and formed "Shovel Superheroes" teams to help clean homes in the affected area. Cities and counties like Keelung, New Taipei City, and Yilan also sent people and equipment to help Hualien.</p>
            <p>Guo Shen-liang, the Secretary-General of the Chinese City God Cultural Association, said today that they learned from the Hualien City God Temple that lunchboxes were urgently needed in the disaster area. They quickly formed a special team. Because time was short, they first asked the Taiwan Provincial City God Temple, Songshan Xiahai City God Temple, Taipei Fu City God Temple, and Keelung Huguo City God Temple to help with money. They started providing lunchboxes to the disaster area on September 26.</p>
            <p>Guo Shen-liang explained that the association asked a Hualien City restaurant to make 1,500 lunchboxes for lunch and 1,000 for dinner every day. Seven small trucks deliver them to Guangfu Township, where a commander gives them out. When the restaurant heard about the disaster, they also helped by lowering the price of each lunchbox from NT$100 to NT$80, while still keeping the same good food quality.</p>
            <p>Guo Shen-liang stated that because of heavy traffic in downtown Guangfu Township, they are now talking with relevant groups about sending the lunchboxes by train instead, to keep the food fresh. Also, it is difficult for local Hualien lunchbox shops to prepare such a large number of meals. They are looking for other lunchbox shops in Hualien to help as much as possible. The association has planned a meeting for tomorrow to discuss how to pay for future lunchboxes and how to help with disaster relief in the medium and long term.</p>

            <h1>India Political Rally Crowd Crush Kills at Least 39; Police Investigate Party Leaders</h1>
            <p>A well-known Indian actor named Vijay, who is now a politician, held a political meeting yesterday in Tamil Nadu. Sadly, a crowd crush happened, killing at least 39 people. A senior Indian police officer said today that the police have started an investigation into important members of Vijay's political party.</p>
            <p>According to Indian news, the crowd crush that happened yesterday in the southern state of Tamil Nadu killed at least 39 people and injured nearly 100. Among those who died were women and 9 children. Vijay was holding the event to promote his party, "Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam," for local elections happening next year.</p>
            <p>Senior police officer V. Selvaraj told Reuters that Tamil Nadu police have opened a case against Bussy Anand, Nirmal Kumar, and V.P. Mathiyalagan, who are senior members of the "Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam" party. This is the first step towards possibly charging them, and the investigation is still ongoing.</p>
            <p>Selvaraj stated that the "Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam" party had only asked for permission for 10,000 people to attend the meeting. However, more than twice that number of people actually showed up.</p>
            <p>Authorities in Tamil Nadu have chosen a committee, led by a retired judge, to find out exactly why the crowd crush happened.</p>
            <p>Vijay has been one of the most popular actors in Tamil movies for the past 30 years. Since he started his political party last year, his public events to promote the party have always attracted very large crowds.</p>
            <p>Vijay said that the crowd crush in Karur county "broke his heart" and he promised to support the families of the people who died.</p>
            <p>Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin also announced that the families of those who died will receive 1 million rupees (about NT$340,000) as payment.</p>
