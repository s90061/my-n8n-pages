            <h1>Former US President Biden Is Getting Radiation and Hormone Treatment for Aggressive Prostate Cancer</h1>
            <p>Former US President Joe Biden is now having radiation treatment and hormone therapy. This is to fight prostate cancer, which doctors found in May this year.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Biden said, "President Biden is currently getting radiation treatment and hormone therapy. This is part of his plan to treat prostate cancer."</p>
            <p>Biden's office announced in May that the 82-year-old former president went to the doctor because of problems with his urinary system. Doctors found a lump in his prostate. They then said he had aggressive prostate cancer, and the cancer had moved to his bones.</p>
            <p>At that time, Biden wrote on X, a social media platform, "Cancer affects all of us. Like many of you, Jill and I have learned that people are strongest where they are broken. Thank you for your love and support."</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society says that prostate cancer is the most common cancer for men, especially older men. Studies guess that about 80% of men over 80 years old have cancer cells in their prostate.</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society also says that if doctors find prostate cancer early, it can often be cured. But it is still the second biggest cause of cancer death for men.</p>
            <p>Hormone therapy is a common way to treat it. It can make tumors smaller and slow down how fast the cancer grows. However, it cannot cure the cancer completely.</p>

            <h1>Soldier Gives Secret Military Information to Chinese Agent, Charged with Corruption</h1>
            <p>A navy soldier named Cai took money from a former soldier named Lin. Lin was kicked out of the military because of gambling. Cai took many photos of secret books about how to use "Hsiung Feng II" missiles. Lin then gave these photos to a female Chinese agent. Cai got 38,000 New Taiwan Dollars for this. Cai is now charged with corruption, and Lin is charged under the National Security Act.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office said that an intelligence officer from China's Armed Police Force, Shanxi Province, used fake names "Chu Ting" and "Ti Ying". To hide her real identity, she said she was a reporter for the Epoch Times in Hong Kong. In 2023, she met Lin, the former navy soldier, through a dating app.</p>
            <p>Lin talked with "Chu Ting" many times. He knew she was an agent from mainland China or another country. Still, he introduced Cai to her. He asked Cai to give her military information. He told Cai that the more secret the information was, the more money "Chu Ting" would pay him after she checked it.</p>
            <p>Cai knew that as a soldier, he should not share military information. But he took the money. In May 2023, he filled in his personal details, military unit, and job on forms and a survey from the agent. He sent these through Lin to "Chu Ting" and received 8,000 NT dollars.</p>
            <p>In the same month, Cai used his phone to take photos of a whole book called "Launch Site Drill Manual" for the Hsiung Feng II missile launcher and the missile vehicle's operation manual. He sent these outside the military. "Chu Ting" thought this information was useful military intelligence, so Cai got another 30,000 NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors believe that Cai, a navy soldier at the time, knew that Taiwan and China were in a military conflict. He should not have given information about his unit, official secrets, or sensitive military information that was not for public knowledge to Chinese agents. He did it for his own money. This broke the Constitution, the National Defense Act, and the Conscription Act, which say soldiers must be " loyal to the Republic of China" and "keep military secrets". He took bribes by not doing his duty.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors also said that Cai was trained by the military and was in charge of using Taiwan's own missiles to protect the sea border. This is a very sensitive and important job. But he shared his personal military check information and took photos of military weapon operation information that was not public. Even if the content was not top secret, it still hurt national security and military morale. It also made the military look bad and went against what a soldier should be.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office has charged Cai with corruption for taking bribes and not doing his job. Lin is also charged and held in custody for breaking the National Security Act.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Man Crashes Car into Tea Shop While Drug-Driving, One Dead and One Hurt; Ordered to Be Held Without Contact</h1>
            <p>A man named Liu drove his car into a tea shop in Taichung City's West District early on October 9th. This caused one mother and son inside the shop to die and one to be injured. Tests showed that Liu's urine had drugs in it. Today, after leaving the hospital, he was sent to court for causing death by accident and for endangering public safety. The Taichung District Court ordered him to be held in jail and not allowed to see anyone.</p>
            <p>At the crossing of Wuchuan West Road and Wuchuan Road in Taichung City's West District, at 3:21 AM on October 9th, a car crashed into a tea shop at high speed. This accident hurt a mother and son inside the shop, causing one death and one injury. The urine of the 43-year-old driver, Mr. Liu, tested positive for drugs. After Mr. Liu left the hospital today, the police took him to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office.</p>
            <p>After questioning, the prosecutor believed that Liu had committed serious crimes. These included driving a vehicle under the influence of drugs, which caused someone's death (under the Criminal Law), and using and having Class 2 drugs (under the Drug Hazard Control Act). Besides facing at least three years in prison, he will also have to pay a lot of money for civil damages. The prosecutor thought he might try to run away. Also, they need to find out where the drugs came from, and there was enough proof to think he might try to work with other criminals. So, the prosecutor asked the Taichung District Court to hold him and not allow him to see anyone, and the court agreed.</p>
