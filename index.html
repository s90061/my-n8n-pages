            <h1>Poll: More Than Half of Americans Think Changing Voting Districts Is Bad for Democracy</h1>
            <p>A new survey by Reuters/Ipsos shows that most Americans believe that changing the maps of voting areas for the House of Representatives, like in Texas and California, is bad for democracy. This is because these changes are made to help one political party win more votes.</p>
            <p>The survey found that more than half (57%) of the people asked are worried that American democracy is in danger. 80% of Democrats and 40% of Republicans feel this way.</p>
            <p>The survey also shows that people are very worried about the growing political disagreements in Washington D.C. and in different states. Currently, the Republican party controls both parts of Congress. This survey took 6 days and finished on August 18th. 4,446 adult Americans took part in it.</p>
            <p>The survey found that 55% of the people, including 71% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans, think that the ongoing plans to redraw voting maps, like the "gerrymandering" done by the governors of Texas and California, "are bad for democracy."</p>
            <p>President Trump asked Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, to hold a special meeting of the state parliament. They plan to redraw the voting areas for Congress before the 2026 elections. This will help the Republican party keep their majority in the House, where they currently have 219 seats compared to 212 for the other party.</p>
            <p>Historically, in mid-term elections, the president's party often loses seats in the House. This can stop new laws from passing. During Trump's first time as president, this led to two impeachment investigations.</p>
            <p>In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who might run for president in 2028, said he would try to redraw California's voting map. He wants to add 5 more seats for Democrats to balance out the seats Republicans expect to gain in Texas.</p>
            <p>This way of changing voting maps is not new. But it is getting attention because it is not happening after the usual ten-year population count. This means that most House elections are not very competitive in general elections. In recent decades, about two-thirds of House elections were won by more than 20 percent.</p>

            <h1>AI and Net Zero / New Use for Korotkoff Sound Technology: ComeCare Measures Blood Pressure with Vibrations</h1>
            <p>Measuring blood pressure regularly is important for staying healthy. But for people with hardened arteries or diabetes, electronic blood pressure machines might not give correct readings. This can happen because of how they are set up, how a person sits, or the way the measurement is taken. ComeCare Medical is working to create a blood pressure machine that uses Korotkoff sounds. This is a difficult problem in medicine. The company will also work with a sales company in the U.S. to sell their product worldwide.</p>
            <p>When most people think about checking blood pressure, they imagine a doctor using a stethoscope. The doctor puts a cuff around the arm, presses on the artery, and listens to the pulse while watching a mercury gauge. This method has been used for over a hundred years. A Russian doctor named Nikolai Korotkoff improved it between 1904 and 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War. As the cuff's pressure goes down, the doctor listens to the sounds the blood makes as it moves through the blood vessel. These sounds are used to measure blood pressure and are called "Korotkoff Sounds." This method is still the medical standard for checking blood pressure today.</p>
            <p>The Korotkoff sound method has been difficult to make automatic. The main reason is that there was no electronic technology that could listen as well as a human ear and also be cheap enough. Because of this, it has not become common for home use. Most electronic blood pressure machines sold today use a different method called the oscillometric method. This method is easy to use, but sometimes its results can be a little different from the Korotkoff sound method.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi, the CEO of ComeCare Medical Technology, said that "the job of a scientist is to build models. Once you find the right model, you can make difficult problems simpler." He explained that the oscillometric method turns changes in blood pressure into a "model." It figures out blood pressure numbers by finding the connection between the pulse waves and the air pressure in the cuff for both the top and bottom blood pressure readings.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that "if these connections are always the same, you can build a model and use it for everyone." But this is where the problem is. The original model for the oscillometric method was made using young people who had healthy blood vessels and whose bodies were very similar. However, as people get older, especially after age 50, they are more likely to get long-term illnesses like kidney disease, diabetes, and hardened arteries. Their blood vessels are very different from when they were young, which makes blood pressure measurements less accurate.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi has worked in medical devices for over 20 years. He believes that if they cannot use Korotkoff sound technology to go beyond the limits of the oscillometric method, they cannot truly make blood pressure monitoring more accurate.</p>
            <p>In 2013, a Japanese company that studied how to measure hardened arteries released a special technology. It used very sensitive sensors to detect tiny vibrations in blood vessels. The first goal of this technology was to create a sensor to find out how bad artery hardening was.</p>
            <p>This caught Lin Kun-yi's attention. He bravely decided to sell his house to buy the patent. In 2018, he started ComeCare Medical to develop this technology, which he felt should exist but was missing.</p>
            <p>In the past, Lin Kun-yi tried to use microphones to pick up Korotkoff sounds. But most sounds inside the human body are low-frequency, like stomach rumbling or the low thumping of a heart. He said, "If there's a problem with the heart, the sound can be like a horse running on sand, which is hard to imagine and capture." Although Korotkoff sounds can be heard by humans, normal microphones cannot record them clearly. "To record them accurately, you would need a microphone like those used at A-mei's concerts, which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars."</p>
            <p>Inspired by the Japanese team, Lin Kun-yi decided to measure vibrations instead. He bought their patent and improved the technology, using a semiconductor strain gauge as the main sensor. This technology was originally used in earthquake warning systems, installed in bridges and buildings, to find small, hidden signals within vibrations.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi explained, "A normal sensor is like a telescope with low power; it can only see the outline of a distant mountain. But a semiconductor sensor is like a high-power telescope; you can clearly see every tree on the mountain and how the treetops move."</p>
            <p>After many years of research, the ComeCare team successfully used this small vibration sensing technology to measure blood pressure. They created a new module called "K-sensor." The "K" comes from the first letter of Dr. Korotkoff's last name, to honor him.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi is thankful for many important supporters along the way. In 2019, ComeCare got money from the National Development Fund. The CEO of TAcc+, Wang Chung-chih, a national program for fast-growing companies, also liked their idea and helped share their technology. Also, the Ministry of Economic Affairs chose ComeCare to be part of the "2025 SelectUSA Tech" team. Lin Kun-yi said that the K-sensor had not applied for any money from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. "Normally, we wouldn't be chosen, but the Ministry saw ComeCare's potential and helped us find business partners in the U.S." ComeCare is still waiting for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (TFDA). Luckily, ComeCare has already made a plan to work with EXEL, a U.S. company that sells medical supplies, at the "SelectUSA Investment Summit." After getting FDA approval, they will start selling their product in other countries.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi stated, "ComeCare's long-term goal is for everyone to be able to use the Korotkoff sound technology. We want to create more ways to read human body signals and even develop vibration patterns for problems like heart failure." If this technology works well, they hope to use it in more areas and find new ways to monitor body signals in the future.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Says He Can Meet Putin, But Needs Security Guarantees from Allies First</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said that he can meet with Russian President Putin. But first, Ukraine's friends must agree to give Ukraine security promises. These promises would help stop Russia from attacking again after the fighting stops.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned today that both sides are getting ready for more fighting. He said that Russia is gathering its troops in the south, and Ukraine is testing new long-range cruise missiles.</p>
            <p>Today, Russia said that Ukraine does not seem interested in "long-term peace." Russia claims that Kyiv's request for security promises does not match what Moscow wants at all.</p>
            <p>U.S. President Trump is trying to arrange a meeting between Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin. The goal is to end Russia's war against Ukraine, which has been going on for three and a half years.</p>
            <p>Trump has changed the Western approach of keeping the Russian leader isolated for many years. However, there has been no real progress in making a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy told reporters today, "We want to understand the structure of security promises within 7 to 10 days. We need to know which country is ready to do what at each specific moment."</p>
            <p>Allies, led by the UK and France, are forming a military group to support security promises for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said that once this plan for security promises is agreed upon, Trump wants to see Putin and Zelenskyy have a meeting together.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that his meeting with Putin should happen in a "neutral" European country. He does not want the meeting to be in Moscow.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said no to the idea of China helping with security promises for Ukraine. He explained that Beijing is said to be supporting Moscow.</p>
