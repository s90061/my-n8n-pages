            <h1>Morning World: Minimum Wage Goes Up, Monthly Salary NT$29,500, Hourly Wage NT$196</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor announced on September 26 that the minimum wage will increase. The monthly salary will change from NT$28,590 to NT$29,500. The hourly wage will go from NT$190 to NT$196. This is an increase of 3.18%. Almost 2.47 million workers will benefit from this change.</p>
            <p>The Minister of Labor, Hong Shen-han, said there were three main reasons for this decision. First, they looked at how much prices for goods have changed. Second, they thought about how workers can share in the country's economic growth. Third, they considered how uncertain global trade might affect businesses and workers. The Ministry of Labor will also help businesses that are affected by US tariffs.</p>
            <p>Worker representatives said they were not fully happy with the decision but could accept it. Business representatives said the meeting went well and they were very happy with the result. They will now watch for the government's plans to help businesses.</p>

            <h1>Germany Uses AI Virtual Minister; First Video Criticizes TikTok in Chinese</h1>
            <p>The German government has introduced its first AI virtual minister, named "Weimatar." In his first video, he spoke in Chinese and criticized TikTok for its bad influence on young people. He also shared his thoughts on anti-Jewish events, the relationship between Germany and Poland, and the role of media in Europe.</p>
            <p>The German government announced that a European AI company called Synthesia created "Weimatar." His look and voice are very similar to Wolfram Weimer, who is the real German Minister for Culture and Media. It is hard to tell them apart.</p>
            <p>Mr. Weimer said in a press release that artificial intelligence brings many chances for culture, creativity, and communication. But it also brings dangers like deepfake technology, unclear information, and fake news. He stated that "Weimatar" represents a fair use of AI. It will protect creative works and also help public discussions in a democratic society.</p>
            <p>Officials explained that Weimatar will be used in two ways. First, he can quickly share policy messages in many languages on social media. Second, he can be used to make training videos for the Ministry of Culture and Media. This will make it easier to update and share information. He is a tool for sharing information and also helps reduce the work for staff.</p>
            <p>In the first video, released on September 24, Weimatar first introduced himself. He said he is not a deepfake but a policy tool that can speak hundreds of languages. Then he spoke in Chinese. He said that TikTok's algorithms make young people "addicted" and spread dangerous trends and unhealthy beauty standards.</p>
            <p>He stressed that if platforms want to work in Europe, they must follow rules about being clear, responsible, and protecting young people well. They must also help free speech and different opinions.</p>
            <p>He also used Dutch to criticize a recent event where a Belgian music festival canceled an Israeli artist's performance. He said that "anti-Jewish feelings should not be on European stages." Then, he spoke in Polish about the friendship and cultural exchange between Germany and Poland. Finally, he used French to ask for support for European public media. This is to fight against fake news and protect European culture.</p>
            <p>Germany is not the first country to create a virtual official. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs once had a virtual spokesperson, Viktoria Shi. She used an AI image to share the country's views with the world. Albania's Prime Minister also named a chatbot, Diella, as the "Minister of Public Procurement." This chatbot manages government bids to lower the risk of corruption.</p>
            <p>However, this way of sharing policy also has risks. The SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) newspaper thinks that the real problem with AI virtual people like "Weimatar" is not that the content might go wrong. Instead, it is the "habit effect."</p>
            <p>The newspaper commented that if society accepts and gets used to trustworthy governments using these virtual people, the line between real life and the digital world will become less clear. The newspaper warned that this could make democracy an automatic process. Decisions that should be made by parliament and public discussion might instead be made by technology. This would make democracy weaker and reduce the role of humans in it.</p>

            <h1>France's Debt is Like a "Himalayan Mountain," Reaching a New High of 3.4 Trillion Euros</h1>
            <p>This week, France's national statistics office (INSEE) shared new numbers. In the second quarter of 2025, France's public debt was very high, at 3.4 trillion Euros. This is 115.6% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This puts France among the countries with the highest debt in Europe.</p>
            <p>This amount is higher than the record from the first quarter, which was 3.345 trillion Euros, or 114% of GDP. In just the second quarter, France's debt grew by 70.9 billion Euros.</p>
            <p>Le Figaro newspaper reported that France's debt is growing very fast. This is because the country has not made big changes to its economy, unlike its neighbors. FranÃ§ois Bayrou, a former Prime Minister who recently left office, once said this debt was like a "Himalayan mountain." It has grown by 1 trillion Euros in less than 10 years.</p>
            <p>On September 23, Alvaro Pereira, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), gave a warning. He said, "France should be very careful with its money problems in the next few years. It needs to learn from countries like Italy and Portugal. These countries have gotten their budgets back in order, but France's debt is still growing."</p>
            <p>Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain were called the "PIGS" group in the early 2010s. This was because they had serious debt problems. Their debt grew a lot during the COVID-19 pandemic, but now it has started to go down.</p>
            <p>Spain's debt reached its highest point in 2021, at 124.2% of GDP. But in the first quarter of this year, it successfully fell to 103.5%. Portugal's debt also went down. It was 134.9% in 2020 and is now 96.4% at the start of this year.</p>
            <p>Italy's debt decreased from 154.9% in 2020 to 137.9% this year. Greece's debt fell from 163.9% in 2024 to 152.5% this year.</p>
            <p>So, when we look at debt compared to GDP, France is now the third most indebted country in the European Union (EU).</p>
            <p>On September 12, Fitch Ratings, a company that rates countries' credit, lowered France's credit rating from AA- to A+. They did this because of political problems and money issues. At the same time, the new French Prime Minister, SÃ©bastien Lecornu, is trying to get everyone to agree on the budget for 2026, which is causing him a lot of pressure.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Lecornu has not made much progress in talks with opposition parties. Major worker unions are threatening to go on strike again on October 2. Business groups have also announced they will meet on October 13 to protest against possible new taxes.</p>
