            <h1>Thailand's Officials Attend Taiwan's National Day Party, Showing Strong Friendship</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office held a National Day party in Bangkok tonight. Important Thai officials, police, media, and Chinese community groups came to celebrate. The Taiwan Representative, Mr. Lan Shiah-li, said that Taiwan and Thailand can work together a lot. He called Taiwan a good partner for Thailand's economic growth in the future and talked about the long-standing friendship and good results of their cooperation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lan Shiah-li noted that tonight was also the Mid-Autumn Festival. He thanked more than a thousand people for coming to the National Day party. He said this shows how much people support Taiwan and feel warmly towards it. In his speech, he shared how he described Taiwan in a recent interview. He used three words: "beautiful," "innovative," and "strong."</p>
            <p>He mentioned that Taiwan is known as one of the safest and friendliest places to visit in the world. From 2015 until before the pandemic, more than 10 million international tourists visited Taiwan every year. Also, in 2024 alone, nearly 400,000 Thai friends visited Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lan also said that Taiwan is very important in the global artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor, and information and communication technology (ICT) industries. Many big international companies choose to set up their research centers in Taiwan. This shows Taiwan's important role in global innovation. It also shows Taiwan's wish to become an "AI island."</p>
            <p>He also said that Taiwan is strong. In the second quarter of this year, Taiwan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by more than 8%. This was one of the highest in Asia, showing its strong economy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lan said that President Lai Ching-te wants to create an "economy that never sets." Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung supports this with "total diplomacy" and "economic diplomacy." They hope to combine efforts from both public and private sectors through the "Rongbang Project." This project will continue to promote "five key trusted industries" and the "digital New Southbound Policy."</p>
            <p>He stressed that Taiwan and Thailand have great potential for working together. In 2024, Taiwan was the 4th largest source of foreign investment for Thailand and its 5th largest trading partner. Taiwan is a good partner for Thailand's future economic development. The two countries also have a long history of friendship and many successful collaborations.</p>
            <p>Many Thai officials, police, elected representatives, and media reporters came to the National Day party. A Thai prosecutor named Nattanon Limsakul, who studied in Taiwan, attended for the first time. He said that today felt like being back in Taiwan, and it felt very kind. He felt that "Taiwanese people are very friendly."</p>
            <p>Parinya Wongtawan, a Thai teacher who has taught many Taiwanese students, told CNA that "today's event was perfect." She added that Taiwan and Thailand are very similar, and people in both places are friendly.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chu Li-yu, who works in the beauty industry and has lived in Thailand for more than 20 years, comes to the National Day party every year. She said it is a touching annual gathering for Taiwanese people in a foreign country.</p>
            <p>The welcome board for the National Day party used "Taiwan Wafer Resilience" as its design idea. It combined the main National Day design with the Taipei 101 building. The ice sculpture had the numbers "114" with a map of Taiwan that looked like a circuit board, and the word "TAIWAN." This showed Taiwan's important role in the global semiconductor industry and the government's efforts to create an "AI Artificial Intelligence Island." Many guests stopped to take pictures.</p>
            <p>Also, the party included the "Thai-wan Chamber Orchestra," made up of Taiwanese living in Thailand and Thai musicians. They played many classic Taiwanese songs and folk music. This added Taiwanese culture to the event. Several guests wearing traditional Thai clothes also danced spontaneously, making the party feel more Thai and happy.</p>

            <h1>Dongshi Sea-Land Festival Fireworks Show in Chiayi: 18,000 Fireworks Light Up the Mid-Autumn Night Sky</h1>
            <p>The 2025 "Dongshi Sea-Land Festival" fireworks show at sea started at 7 PM tonight in Chiayi County. In 12 minutes, 18,000 fireworks were set off. They were very beautiful, giving about 70,000 people at the show a great memory for the Mid-Autumn Festival. People also praised how quickly the traffic left after the show.</p>
            <p>"When several 16-inch fireworks exploded over the sea, they spread out in circles in the sky, more than 2 or 3 kilometers wide. Almost everyone watching was amazed," a photographer at the event told CNA reporters. He added that the fireworks in the sky, reflected in the sea, were incredibly beautiful.</p>
            <p>Shen Ya-ju, head of the planning section at the Chiayi County Culture and Tourism Bureau, which organized the "Dongshi Sea-Land Festival," said the weather was very good tonight. A light wind blew the smoke towards the sea, so it did not block the audience's view. The wind also did not change the shape of the fireworks, so they looked clear and beautiful.</p>
            <p>Shen Ya-ju said that the "Dongshi Sea-Land Festival" was supposed to happen in the summer. But because of a natural disaster, it was moved to the Mid-Autumn holiday. The fireworks show at sea was originally planned for 9 PM, but because autumn nights come earlier, it was changed to 7 PM. Police started managing traffic and guiding cars from noon to stop too many vehicles from going into Dongshi Fisherman's Wharf.</p>
            <p>Shen Ya-ju noted that last year, it took until midnight for all people and cars to leave after the fireworks. This did not happen tonight. People and cars were gone within an hour after the fireworks finished. The event ended successfully.</p>
            <p>Chiayi County Magistrate Weng Chang-liang thanked local people and visitors for their warm participation and support. He said, "See you next year at the Sea-Land Festival."</p>

            <h1>Israel Removes Over 100 People from Gaza Aid Fleet, Including Environmental Activist Greta Thunberg</h1>
            <p>The Israeli government announced today that it has sent away another 171 people who were part of an aid fleet going to Gaza. Among them was Greta Thunberg, a young environmental activist from Sweden.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the United Nations (UN) says that the Gaza Strip is suffering from hunger after two years of serious fighting. This aid fleet, made up of 45 boats, planned to break Israel's block on Gaza and deliver help there.</p>
            <p>Israel started stopping these aid boats in international waters on October 1st. Israeli officials said on October 2nd that they had stopped boats carrying over 400 people from reaching Gaza.</p>
            <p>Today, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on X (a social media platform) that they had sent away Greta Thunberg and 170 other "troublemakers" from Israel to Greece and Slovakia. The people sent away included citizens from Greece, Italy, France, and the United States.</p>
            <p>A photo in the post showed Thunberg and two other women wearing gray sweatpants, which are common in Israeli prisons. They were walking through Israel's Ramon Airport.</p>
            <p>Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told AFP that 138 people from the "Global Sumud Flotilla" are still being held by Israel.</p>
            <p>Some members of the fleet who were previously sent away by Israel arrived in Istanbul, Turkey. On October 4th, they said they were treated badly and "like animals."</p>
            <p>Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on X today, saying, "The legal rights of those involved in this public relations stunt are fully protected, and will be in the future." They also added, "The lies they spread are part of their planned fake news campaign."</p>
