            <h1>Taiwanese-American Player Fairchild Moves to Rays, Continues Major League Opportunity</h1>
            <p>Jaylin Fairchild, a Taiwanese-American baseball player who plays in the outfield, had lost his place on the Braves team. After being removed from the Major League 40-man roster, the Tampa Bay Rays signed him today. This gives him another chance to play in Major League Baseball.</p>
            <p>Fairchild is 29 years old. He has played in Major League Baseball for five seasons and is one of the players who might play for the Taiwan team in the 2026 World Baseball Classic (WBC). He is very good at defense and very fast. When he was interviewed this spring, he said he would like to play for the Taiwan team.</p>
            <p>This year, Fairchild played for the Braves as a backup outfielder. He was trying to keep his place in Major League Baseball. Yesterday, the Braves announced they had assigned him for assignment (DFA). This removed him from their Major League 40-man roster. His career now means he could be sent to the minor leagues or move to another team.</p>
            <p>Today, the Tampa Bay Rays announced they had signed Fairchild in a cash trade. He will wear jersey number 20. Today, the Rays played against the Chicago White Sox at home. Fairchild was on the active player list but did not start the game.</p>
            <p>Fairchild did not get many chances to play for the Braves this year. At the end of May, he hurt his right little finger while sliding, and he missed more than two weeks of games. This season, he played in 28 games. He had 51 at-bats and got 11 hits. His batting average was .216, and he did not hit any home runs.</p>

            <h1>US Government Considers Punishments for Mexican Airlines Due to Flight Limits</h1>
            <p>The US government is not happy because the Mexican government has put unfair limits on US cargo airlines since 2022. These limits include where planes can land and take off. The US government recently said that if Mexico does not fix this quickly, they will add more punishments for Mexican airlines that fly to the US.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Transportation said that the Mexican government, under former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, ordered US cargo airlines to move their main operations from Mexico City International Airport (AICM) to Felipe Angeles International Airport. This new airport is outside the city center. The Mexican government also canceled some landing and takeoff times. The US believes this makes it unfair for airlines to compete in the market.</p>
            <p>The Mexican newspaper "EL FINANCIERO" reported today, July 22, that US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said Mexico "broke its promise, changed the market unfairly, and hurt American companies." He added that the US will not accept this kind of behavior from Mexico anymore. He also said that future punishments are part of US President Trump's "America First" policy. Duffy also gave a similar warning to European airlines.</p>
            <p>The US said that American airlines have complained to the Mexican government many times. Moving far from the city center costs more money. Also, the Mexican government stopped US air cargo companies from landing in many places in Mexico to carry more international goods. The US government and airlines have complained and tried to talk many times, but they have not received a reply.</p>
            <p>The report said that the US government might take actions like asking Mexican airlines to share all their flight plans in the US beforehand. Also, all large charter flights carrying passengers or cargo would need approval from the US Department of Transportation before they fly. The US might also take away the special permission that allows Delta Air Lines (an American airline) and Aeromexico (a Mexican airline) to work together on prices and routes. This permission usually stops them from breaking competition laws.</p>
            <p>The report also said that flights between the US and Mexico are among the busiest in the world. If Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico lose their special permission to work together, Aeromexico will lose its ability to work with other airlines on routes and prices, which gives them an advantage. This would cause them to lose money. The US Department of Transportation also warned that if the Mexican government does not change its rules quickly, the US might not approve new flights from Mexican airlines in the future.</p>
            <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and transport officials defended the former president's policy against the US government's accusations. Sheinbaum said that moving the US cargo airlines' operations from Mexico City International Airport to Felipe Angeles International Airport was a technical decision. The main reason was to make Mexico City International Airport less crowded and to make flying safer and more efficient.</p>
            <p>Responding to the US threat of punishments, Sheinbaum said that these changes are good for everyone, and companies are already getting used to them. So, she said there is no reason for them to be punished.</p>
            <p>The report's analysis said that the tension between the US and Mexico, which started with issues like changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico and increasing taxes on goods that come by land, has now moved to air travel. The future of this situation is worrying.</p>
