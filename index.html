            <h1>Central Bank: New Taiwan Dollar Stablecoins Will Have Limited Effect on Local Payment System</h1>
            <p>The US government is working on a law called the "GENIUS Act," which has made stablecoins a popular topic in finance this year. Taiwan's Central Bank released a report about stablecoins. It said that even if New Taiwan Dollar stablecoins are created, they will not greatly affect the local payment system or the money supply. They will also not stop Taiwan's money policies from working.</p>
            <p>When the US passed the GENIUS Act, it helped stablecoins grow faster. This led to many discussions in the financial world about how stablecoins would affect money and financial markets.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank's report explained that virtual assets around the world are growing fast. People who invest in these assets want more stable ways to trade. If they use Bitcoin, its price can change a lot. If they use regular money, there are old financial rules. So, starting in 2014, stablecoins were developed. Their value is linked to regular money.</p>
            <p>A stablecoin is a type of virtual asset. It can be used for payments and uses blockchain technology. Now, stablecoins are the main way to trade in the virtual world. More than 80% of virtual asset trades use stablecoins.</p>
            <p>Most countries have two main ways to control stablecoins. One way is to create a special law just for stablecoins, like in the US and Hong Kong. The other way is to make a general law for all virtual assets, which includes rules for stablecoins. Examples of this are the European Union and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank said that Taiwan's approach to stablecoin rules is similar to the EU's. Taiwan is writing a "Virtual Asset Service Act" to manage virtual assets, and this law will include rules for stablecoins.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's rules for stablecoins are similar to those in developed countries like the US and the EU. These rules usually cover things like permission to issue stablecoins, who can issue them, keeping assets separate, managing reserve assets (like what makes up the reserves and needing a third party to check them), not paying interest, and sharing information.</p>
            <p>People are wondering if Taiwan will have New Taiwan Dollar stablecoins and what financial authorities think. The Central Bank said that New Taiwan Dollar stablecoins are similar to electronic payment tokens in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank explained that issuing stablecoins means taking money from many different people, which is similar to how electronic payment systems collect stored money from the public. Both are used for payments.</p>
            <p>Also, stablecoins use technologies like blockchain. This is similar to how EasyCard and iPASS in Taiwan are electronic payment tokens. However, the Central Bank noted that stablecoins can be used for trading in virtual markets, but EasyCard and iPASS do not have this feature yet.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank believes that if New Taiwan Dollar stablecoins are used for payments, they will not have a big effect on the current payment system in Taiwan. This is because there are not many virtual assets priced in New Taiwan Dollars right now. So, there is not a great need to issue New Taiwan Dollar stablecoins for trading these assets.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank also said that Taiwan has a very complete payment system. It already has many ways to pay, like credit cards, debit cards, bank deposits, and electronic payments. These offer quick and cheap payment services. So, New Taiwan Dollar stablecoins acting as a payment tool should have a limited effect on the local payment system.</p>
            <p>As for how stablecoins might affect the country's money supply and how money policies work, the Central Bank thinks that issuing New Taiwan Dollar stablecoins would mostly just move money around the market. It would not greatly affect Taiwan's total money supply (M2) or how banks create credit. Even if New Taiwan Dollar stablecoins are issued, they will not disturb how Taiwan's money policies are put into action.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank said that if Taiwan decides to issue stablecoins in the future, the Financial Supervisory Commission will ask for the Central Bank's opinion. The Central Bank will also work with the Financial Supervisory Commission to create the detailed rules.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Gongguan Roundabout Work: Traffic Slow on First Day of Second Week Due to Weather and Accidents</h1>
            <p>Today is the first weekday of the second week for the project to remove the Gongguan roundabout and fill in the underpass in Taipei. The Taipei City Traffic Engineering Office said that traffic was heavier than usual. This was because of Typhoon Huagasha, which affected the weather, and also because of some traffic accidents. The traffic on Roosevelt Road going north and on Fuhe Bridge going east (for motorcycles) was especially slow.</p>
            <p>The project to remove the Gongguan roundabout and fill in the underpass started on September 13. The first week of work was from September 15 to 19. The Taipei City Traffic Engineering Office looked at the traffic during this time. They found that except for accidents on Fuhe Bridge and Yongfu Bridge, the overall traffic was similar to before the construction. They will keep staff watching the traffic until the work is finished.</p>
            <p>Regarding today, the first day of the second weekday week of the project, Huang Hui-ru, the deputy head of the Taipei City Traffic Engineering Office, told the Central News Agency that traffic on Roosevelt Road going north and on Fuhe Bridge going east (for motorcycles) was slower due to the weather and accidents.</p>
            <p>She gave more details. First, on Roosevelt Road going north, there was an accident at 7:50 AM in front of Mingchuan Elementary School. Traffic backed up all the way to Lane 211, Section 5, Roosevelt Road. After the accident was cleared at 8:02 AM, traffic returned to normal by 8:55 AM.</p>
            <p>Second, on Fuhe Bridge going east for motorcycles, there were two accidents today at 8:23 AM and 8:39 AM. Traffic backed up to the middle of the bridge. After these accidents were cleared at 8:33 AM and 8:41 AM, traffic returned to normal by 8:45 AM.</p>
            <p>She repeated that both Taipei City and New Taipei City governments will continue to watch all roads together. They will change traffic lights dynamically based on real-time traffic and work with police officers to direct traffic. When accidents or unusually heavy traffic happen, they can be quickly fixed to keep drivers safe and reduce traffic problems during the construction.</p>
