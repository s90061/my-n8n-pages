            <h1>White House: Trump Will Not Meet Putin Alone; Staff Will Be There</h1>
            <p>The White House said that US President Donald Trump will not meet Russian President Vladimir Putin by himself today in Alaska. Instead, important staff will be with them for the whole meeting.</p>
            <p>A reporter from AFP on Air Force One said that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the media this. Trump will not have a private meeting as planned. Instead, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will join him. More officials will also be at a lunch later.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that changing the meeting from a private talk to a bigger group meeting is important.</p>
            <p>The report said that when Trump met Putin alone during his first time as president, these meetings were a bit secret. It was often hard to know what they talked about because only one interpreter was there.</p>
            <p>Also, it was difficult for staff to know if the two leaders agreed on anything. One time, after a meeting in Germany, Trump asked his interpreter to get rid of his notes.</p>
            <p>Now, with Rubio and Witkoff joining the talks in Alaska today, things will be clearer after the meeting. This is helpful especially if Russia's explanation of what happened is different from what the US says.</p>
            <p>One of the staff members will write down notes. This is very important for keeping a clear record of high-level meetings as they happen.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Putin Arrive in Alaska; Talks to Focus on Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>US President Trump and Russian President Putin both arrived in Alaska today for talks. This is the first time they have met since the war between Russia and Ukraine started. The talks will mainly be about stopping the fighting in Ukraine. Trump said earlier that he hopes Russia and Ukraine stop fighting very soon. He added that he would be sad if it did not happen today.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued for almost three and a half years. Trump arrived in Anchorage, which is the biggest city in Alaska, this morning (local time). Putin arrived shortly after in his private plane. They shook hands when they got off their planes, walked on a red carpet for photos, and talked a lot. This is the first time the current presidents of the US and Russia have met since 2021.</p>
            <p>This important meeting, which the world is watching closely, was first planned as a private talk between the two leaders. But the plan changed at the very last moment. CNN reported that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special helper Steve Witkoff will also be there. This will help make things clearer after the meeting, especially if what Russia says about the meeting is different from what the US says.</p>
            <p>The meeting between Trump and Putin is happening at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. This is the largest military place in Alaska. During the Cold War, this base was used for listening to communications. It has special airspace that is controlled, very secure entry points, and can quickly move military groups.</p>
            <p>Alaska was once part of the Russian Empire. The United States bought this land in 1867.</p>

            <h1>US Government May Use Chips Act Money to Buy Intel Shares to Make Chip Making Stronger</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg News, using information from people who know, said that the US government under Trump is thinking about using money from the "Chips Act." This money might be used to buy parts of the Intel company. This plan is to help the semiconductor company, which is having some problems, and to make more computer chips in the US.</p>
            <p>The people who know said that the talks are mainly about using Chips Act money to pay for at least some of the Intel shares. These talks are just starting, and other ideas are still possible. It is not clear yet if the government will change money it has already given into shares, get new money from other places, or mix different ways of getting money.</p>
            <p>After Bloomberg first said that the US government might buy Intel shares, the price of Intel's shares went up a lot. In the last two days, the price has increased by 15%. This could be its best week in many years.</p>
            <p>If this possible deal happens, it will greatly help Intel's money situation. Intel has been letting go of workers and spending less money recently. So, people in the market are watching these talks carefully. But the sources said that all the small details, like where the money will come from, are still being discussed.</p>
            <p>Intel was already the company that got the most money from the "Chips Act." With this plan, Intel got 7.9 billion US dollars to make computer chips for businesses. It also received up to 3 billion US dollars for a special project for the US military called "Secure Enclave." Also, Intel can ask for 11 billion US dollars in loans because of the "Chips Act" that was signed in 2022.</p>
            <p>Sources said that Intel's CEO, Chen Li-wu, is expected to continue in his job. He met with Trump on August 11. This is even though Trump had said bad things about his connections with Chinese companies before.</p>
            <p>Another source said that the Trump government is thinking about quickly using money from the "Chips Act" that has not been used yet. This money would go to areas that are important for the safety of the US.</p>
            <p>The White House, the Commerce Department, and Intel did not want to say anything about these reports.</p>
