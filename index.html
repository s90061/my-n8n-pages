            <h1>Poland Will Reopen Border with Belarus; China-Europe Trains to Start Again on September 25th</h1>
            <p>The China-Europe train service stopped on September 12th because Poland closed its border with Belarus. Poland has now announced that it will reopen the border crossings with Belarus on September 25th, early in the morning. This means the China-Europe trains will start running again. Chinese media reports that at least 130 China-Europe trains are currently stuck.</p>
            <p>According to CCTV news, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on September 23rd that the border crossings with Belarus would reopen on September 25th, early in the morning. He also said that the government would close the border again if needed.</p>
            <p>First Financial reported that Poland closed its border crossings on September 12th. At that time, Poland said it was due to the "West-2025" joint military exercise by Russia and Belarus, and later drone incidents crossing the border. Poland closed all border crossings (for roads and railways) from September 12th until "the safety of Polish citizens is fully guaranteed."</p>
            <p>After the joint military exercise ended on September 18th, Poland did not announce the reopening of its border crossings with Belarus. Instead, it repeated its earlier decision. Also, on September 22nd, Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, announced that the first-ever Poland-Sweden "Gotland Sentry" (SNEX Gotland Sentry) exercise had officially begun.</p>
            <p>Poland's decision to close the border stopped the China-Europe freight trains traveling from China to Europe. These trains were stuck in MaÅ‚aszewicze, Poland, which is next to the Belarusian border. MaÅ‚aszewicze is the largest hub for China-Europe trains in Europe. More than 90% of the train reloading and track changing work happens there.</p>
            <p>First Financial reported that Yang Jie, the general manager of Eurasia Rail International Freight Forwarding (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., said this situation is very unusual. Since the China-Europe train service started in 2014, the MaÅ‚aszewicze crossing has never been closed. It is the main route for these trains.</p>
            <p>He also disagreed with some media reports that said "300 trains are stuck, and the value of the goods is as high as 25 billion euros." He said that the number of trains currently stuck is not that high, and the value of the goods cannot be that much. The biggest impact is on Chinese cross-border e-commerce customers.</p>
            <p>The report quoted data released by Sichuan New Silk Road Company's WeChat account "Silk Road Tuoke" on September 22nd. It showed that over the past week, more than 130 China-Europe trains were stuck in Brest, Belarus.</p>
            <p>Yang Jie also said that people in the industry generally believe that Poland will not keep the border closed forever. So, most companies are waiting to see what happens. He also thinks that in the short term, it will be hard to find a new "alternative route" to handle the amount of goods that pass through MaÅ‚aszewicze.</p>
            <p>He expects that when the MaÅ‚aszewicze crossing reopens on September 25th, there will be a temporary jam. Things will get better after the backlog of trains has passed through smoothly.</p>

            <h1>NTHU Team Discovers Possible Medium-Sized Black Hole, Featured on NASA Website</h1>
            <p>An international team led by National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) has found a possible medium-sized black hole that is eating a star. These medium-sized black holes are like a "missing piece" in the family of black holes. They are very rare to see in space. The results of this study are now on the official website of NASA, the American space agency.</p>
            <p>NTHU announced today that black holes are one of the universe's biggest mysteries. They don't give off light themselves. We can only guess they are there by looking at how things around them change. When a black hole "eats," the changes in temperature and light become important clues to find them.</p>
            <p>We currently know about small black holes and very large black holes. But there is almost no direct proof for "medium-sized black holes" that are in between these two types.</p>
            <p>Professor Kuo-Hsing Chiang from NTHU's Institute of Astronomy led an international research team. They found a rare black hole that might be eating a star. These "medium-sized black holes" are called the "missing piece" of the black hole family. They are very rare to see in space. The research was published in the international journal "The Astrophysical Journal," and it was also shown on the NASA website.</p>
            <p>Professor Chiang explained that this discovery happened because of a sudden increase in brightness. The light source, called NGC 6099 HLX-1, is in the constellation Hercules. It is about 450 million light-years away from Earth. It was first seen in 2009. In 2012, its brightness increased more than 100 times, and then it got dimmer each year.</p>
            <p>Chang Yi-Chi, a graduate student from NTHU's Institute of Astronomy and the main author of the paper, added that this kind of very bright signal usually appears in the center of galaxies and is linked to very large black holes. However, this object is on the edge of a galaxy and gives off rare, super-bright X-ray signals. This matches what scientists expect from medium-sized black holes, so it got a lot of attention.</p>
            <p>Chang Yi-Chi said that medium-sized black holes don't constantly eat things and shine brightly for a long time like very large black holes. Also, there are not as many of them as small black holes, which are easier to see. Medium-sized black holes are usually quiet. They only give off bright X-ray signals for a short time when they are "eating." This gives astronomers a chance to find them.</p>
            <p>To confirm this object, the research team used the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope. They observed and analyzed the data for three years.</p>
            <p>The study showed that the X-ray signal from NGC 6099 HLX-1 in 2012 reached a temperature of about 3 million degrees Celsius. This high temperature matches what happens when a black hole tears a star apart. There is also a dense group of stars around it, like a "buffet," providing an endless supply of food for the black hole.</p>
            <p>Besides the X-ray data, the team also found clues from observations of visible light. By combining this with simulation results, they found that the blue light seen around the object might come from changes in temperature of fast-spinning material near the black hole. The red light is related to the dense group of stars nearby. All this evidence together makes this object a strong candidate for a medium-sized black hole. However, more observations are needed to fully confirm it.</p>

            <h1>DPP Sends Advance Rescue Team to Hualien; Hsu Kuo-yung Donates NT$100,000 for Disaster Relief</h1>
            <p>A natural dam in the Matai'an River in Hualien overflowed and caused damage. Today, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced that its central office has formed an advance rescue team. This team will go to the affected area to help with the rescue work. Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung has set an example by being the first to donate NT$100,000. This money will help Hualien recover from the disaster.</p>
            <p>The DPP released a press statement. It said that after the flood in Guangfu Township, Hualien, yesterday evening, the DPP central office quickly acted. Following instructions from party chairman Lai Ching-te, Hsu Kuo-yung told all party members and public officials across the country to help with rescue efforts. Today, the central office formed an advance rescue team to go to the front lines and help with the ongoing rescue tasks.</p>
            <p>The DPP stated that Hsu Kuo-yung instructed the advance rescue team to work closely with the local county party office on rescue matters. After the rescue team and the Hualien County party office list and gather information, they will arrange for the large equipment needed to clean up the disaster area. They will also coordinate the supplies needed to help the affected people.</p>
            <p>Regarding the serious damage in Guangfu Township, Hualien, Hsu Kuo-yung asked all people in the country to work together. He urged everyone to help the people in Hualien rebuild their homes. Hsu Kuo-yung led by example, donating NT$100,000 to help Hualien recover. Hsu Kuo-yung is also an international director for Lions Clubs International. He said that other community groups have also started rescue and donation work. For example, Lee Min-ching, the director of Lions Club MD3OO A5 District (Keelung, Yilan, Hualien, Taitung), has already gone to Hualien to help fully with the rescue.</p>
            <p>The DPP said that the central office will do its best to help with communication and putting together information for the rescue efforts. They hope that the people in the disaster area will get immediate help and support as soon as possible.</p>
