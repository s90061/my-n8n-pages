            <h1>Sun Sheng Accused of Sexual Assault Against a Teenage Girl and Indecent Acts with Two Women; Prosecutors Ask for Strong Punishment</h1>
            <p>YouTuber Sun Sheng, a member of "Wan Ku Boyz," is accused of sexually assaulting a girl who is under 18. He also allegedly touched two adult women inappropriately while filming or talking. In addition, he reportedly showed private videos of an adult woman to others. Today, prosecutors in Taipei charged him with sexual assault and other crimes. They have asked the court to give him a serious punishment.</p>
            <p>According to the charges from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, on the evening of October 5, 2023, Sun Sheng went to an adult woman named A1's home for a haircut. After the haircut, they were smoking and talking on the balcony. Sun Sheng allegedly touched A1 inappropriately against her will.</p>
            <p>Later, in the early morning of March 17, 2024, Sun Sheng was filming at another adult woman named A2's home. After filming, while A2 was resting on the bed, he reportedly jumped on her and touched her inappropriately against her will.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, on the evening of October 13, 2024, Sun Sheng invited a girl under 16, named A3, to his home. He told her it was to watch him practice dancing. While A3 was listening to music carefully, he allegedly sexually assaulted her against her will.</p>
            <p>Separately, on the evening of July 8, 2025, Sun Sheng and an adult woman named A4 checked into a hotel room in Taipei's Zhongshan District. They recorded eight private videos together. However, Sun Sheng later showed these videos to his friends without A4's permission.</p>
            <p>During the investigation, prosecutors looked at evidence, testimonies, and phone messages. They concluded that Sun Sheng committed crimes such as forced indecent acts, showing private videos without permission, and breaking personal data protection laws. For the attack on the underage girl, he was charged with intentional sexual assault by an adult against a minor.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors stated that Sun Sheng has a "sex addiction." He ignored people's right to control their own bodies. He used trust from friendships or his work to hurt many women. He also harmed a teenage girl. Afterward, he repeatedly claimed that the victims never said they felt uncomfortable. He often tried to use money or emotional pressure when people did not agree with him. He never thought about his own self-centered actions.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors also said that Sun Sheng treated the victims' private videos as his own property and showed them to others without thinking. This made the victims scared. Even after being investigated by the law, he did not feel sorry for his actions. This has caused lasting pain for the victims. He also repeatedly tried to make the victims lie or refuse to help with the investigation. Because of his bad attitude after the crimes, prosecutors asked the court to give him a very strong punishment.</p>

            <h1>6.2 Magnitude Shallow Earthquake Hits Venezuela; Colombia and Other Neighboring Countries Feel It</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported that a 6.2 magnitude earthquake happened today in western and northern Venezuela. This includes the capital city, Caracas. The Venezuelan government stated that there are no reports of serious damage so far.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that, according to the USGS, the earthquake's center was about 24 kilometers from Mene Grande. This is a small oil town with few people in Zulia state. The earthquake happened at a shallow depth of 7.8 kilometers.</p>
            <p>The Colombian Geological Survey measured the earthquake at 6.1 magnitude and called it a "shallow" earthquake. Neighboring Colombia and Caribbean islands like Aruba, CuraÃ§ao, and Bonaire also felt the quake.</p>
            <p>In Venezuela, strong earthquakes are not common. Because of this, many people in cities like Caracas and Maracaibo were scared when buildings shook. They are not used to such strong shaking.</p>
            <p>Many people ran into the streets to be safe. However, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said on state television that the earthquake "did not cause major damage to buildings."</p>
            <p>Venezuela's national earthquake research agency, Funvisis, measured the earthquake at 5.4 magnitude.</p>
            <p>About 80% of Venezuelans live in areas where earthquakes can happen. However, Venezuela has not had a big earthquake since 1997. That year, an earthquake in Cariaco, Sucre state, killed 73 people.</p>
            <p>In 1976, an earthquake in Caracas killed almost 300 people and injured 2000 others.</p>
