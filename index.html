https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/20/uk-families-significantly-cutting-back-on-food-and-heating

Many families in the UK are buying much less food and using less heating because of higher prices. A new report shows that money worries are now a main concern for many households, even more than a year ago. About half of all families are reducing how much food they buy, and a similar number are not using as much heating. This affects people of all ages, but older people and those on lower incomes are finding it particularly hard.

People are also cutting back on other things like going out and buying new clothes. Many are trying to save money by doing things like buying cheaper food brands or cooking at home more often. Experts say that the rising cost of living is causing real problems for people's daily lives and their health. The government is being asked to do more to help these families who are struggling to afford basic necessities.

**Work: Four-Day Week Trial Shows Promise in the UK**

https://theconversation.com/uks-four-day-week-pilot-hailed-a-success-but-dont-expect-it-in-your-workplace-just-yet-222959

A trial where thousands of UK workers worked a four-day week has been called a big success. For six months, over 60 companies allowed their employees to work 80% of their usual hours while still getting paid their full salary. The main goal was to see if people could achieve the same amount of work in less time, and most companies reported that productivity stayed the same or even improved.

The trial also showed that workers felt happier and less stressed. Many said they had a better balance between their work and personal life. Because of these positive results, a lot of the companies involved have decided to keep the four-day week in place. However, experts say it might take some time before this new working model becomes common in all workplaces. There are still challenges to consider for certain industries and job roles.

**Travel: European Cities Start Charging Tourists for Entry**

https://www.euronews.com/travel/2024/02/23/europes-top-tourist-destinations-are-now-charging-visitors-to-keep-tourism-sustainable

Some of Europe's most popular tourist spots are now making visitors pay a fee to enter. This new rule aims to help manage the large number of tourists and protect local attractions. Famous cities like Venice in Italy have started charging a small amount for day-trippers to visit. Other places, such as Amsterdam, already have a tourist tax included in hotel prices.

The idea behind these fees is to reduce the pressure on local resources and keep tourism sustainable for the future. With more people travelling, cities are seeing a strain on their public transport, natural sites, and general infrastructure. By charging a fee, these destinations hope to control tourist numbers and use the money to maintain the city and improve services for both locals and visitors. This trend might spread to more places in Europe soon.`;
