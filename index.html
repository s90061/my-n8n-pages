            <h1>Australia will Spend A$12 Billion to Build Defense Facilities, Supporting AUKUS Nuclear Submarine Deal</h1>
            <p>Australia announced today that it will invest 12 billion Australian dollars (8 billion US dollars) to build defense facilities in Western Australia. This will help with the delivery of submarines under the AUKUS nuclear submarine agreement.</p>
            <p>The AUKUS agreement was made in 2021 by Australia, the UK, and the US. Its goal is to give Australia nuclear-powered attack submarines starting in the next ten years. This is to respond to China's plans in the Indo-Pacific area. The US President Trump's government is officially looking at this agreement again.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said that the planned facility is very important for Australia's shipbuilding and maintenance industry. It will help Western Australia continue to build warships and support Australia's nuclear-powered submarine program.</p>
            <p>Last year, the Australian government first invested 127 million Australian dollars (84 million US dollars) to improve the Henderson shipyard near Perth. They also said that billions of Australian dollars will be spent over the next 20 years to make it a repair center for the AUKUS submarine fleet.</p>
            <p>The AUKUS agreement is worth hundreds of billions of US dollars. Under this agreement, the US will sell several Virginia-class nuclear submarines to Australia. Later, the UK and Australia will work together to build new AUKUS-class submarines.</p>

            <h1>Over 100,000 People Join Far-Right Rally in London, Conflicts Break Out and 9 People Arrested</h1>
            <p>In London today, a large gathering led by right-wing activist Tommy Robinson saw more than 100,000 people. Conflicts happened, and police faced "unacceptable violence" when trying to control the crowd. Nine people were arrested.</p>
            <p>According to AFP and Reuters, Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, calls himself a journalist who exposes wrongdoing by the state. He called this "Unite the Kingdom" rally and march the country's "biggest freedom of speech festival."</p>
            <p>About 1.5 kilometers north, another protest with about 5,000 people took place. This was a "Stand Up to Racism" march. The London Metropolitan Police sent about 1,000 police officers to keep the two groups separate.</p>
            <p>London police said the conflicts at the "Unite the Kingdom" rally happened because some people could not get to the main stage. They tried to break into a "clear zone" close to the opposing group.</p>
            <p>Police said, "When officers tried to stop them, they met with unacceptable violence. People hit and kicked them, and also threw bottles, flares, and other things at them."</p>
            <p>Police have arrested 9 people so far and said that more arrests might happen.</p>
            <p>The UK is seeing a record number of asylum applications. Because of this, immigration is now the main political issue, more important than worries about the economy slowing down. So far this year, more than 28,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel by small boats to enter the country.</p>

            <h1>Drone Enters Romanian Airspace, Fighter Jets Take Off Quickly to Respond</h1>
            <p>Romania's Ministry of Defense said that a drone entered Romanian airspace today during Russia's attacks on Ukrainian buildings. Romanian fighter jets went into the air right away to respond.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Poland also had a drone attack threat. Warsaw sent its own and allied military planes and closed the airport in the eastern city of Lublin. Three days earlier, Poland worked with its NATO allies to shoot down a Russian drone in its airspace.</p>
            <p>Romania is a member of the European Union and NATO. It shares a land border with Ukraine that is about 650 kilometers long. Since Russia started its full invasion of Ukraine in 2022, parts of Russian drones have been found many times in Romania.</p>
            <p>According to a statement from the Ministry of Defense, Romania quickly sent two F-16 fighter jets today. They also sent a warning to people in Tulcea, a southeastern area near the border, to take shelter.</p>
            <p>The statement said that the fighter jets found a drone that had entered the country's airspace. They followed it until it disappeared from radar.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Defense added, "The drone did not fly over areas where people live, so there was no immediate danger to people."</p>
