            <h1>Taiwan Prepares Medicine Stock for Possible US Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Minister of Health and Welfare, Chiu Tai-yuan, said that Taiwan is checking its supply of medicines made in the United States. Taiwan plans to increase its stock of medicines made in Taiwan and the materials used to make them. This is because US President Trump might raise taxes on medicines imported into the US. The goal is to have enough ready-to-use medicines for at least three months and enough raw materials for six months. This will make sure Taiwan always has enough medicine.</p>
            <p>Minister Chiu spoke at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Health and Environment Committee today. He explained how US taxes on medicines might affect Taiwan's medicine industry. Before the meeting, he told reporters that two government groups, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA), have started four main plans. These plans are to: give earlier warnings, hold more medicine stock, keep medicine prices fair, and support making medicines in Taiwan. They will work hard to make sure people in Taiwan always have the medicines they need.</p>
            <p>He said that for important medicines, if there is a shortage, they will use a special system to quickly check and respond. The plan to increase medicine stock means they will buy more medicines to store in Taiwan. This is to be ready for any problems with getting medicines.</p>
            <p>Chiu Tai-yuan said they have checked all the medicines made in the US. They have also talked to the companies that sell these medicines to understand the supply from other countries. Taiwan will increase its own medicine stock. There should be enough ready-to-use medicine for at least three months and raw materials for six months. This will make sure there is enough supply and keep people in Taiwan safe when they use medicines.</p>
            <p>Regarding fair medicine prices, Chiu Tai-yuan stated that both the FDA and NHIA have good systems to control medicine prices. If costs go up, there are ways to change prices fairly. Also, Taiwan is encouraging more local companies to make medicines. This makes Taiwan's medicine supply more stable and helps Taiwan rely less on other countries for medicines.</p>
            <p>A politician named Chen Chao-tzu from the Taiwan People's Party said that Taiwan's market is quite small. She believes Taiwan should check its medicine supply chain more carefully and give warnings sooner. She also thinks Taiwan should change how medicine prices are managed and how people pay for them. At the same time, Taiwan should encourage making local medicines to protect its own market. She also said that medicines made in other countries and local medicines should be treated equally. Local companies should be encouraged to make special and important medicines, not just cheaper copies. This will help Taiwan's market stay important.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Restaurants Pass Hygiene Checks After Initial Problems</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau recently checked all-you-can-eat restaurants. They inspected 19 restaurants and 19 food items. At first, five restaurants did not follow good rules for food hygiene. Also, one drink did not meet health standards. The bureau told these places to make changes. After they made changes, all of them passed the second check.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau announced today that all-you-can-eat restaurants are popular because they offer many different kinds of food. From July to August, the bureau carried out special checks. They looked at how clean the food was, how products were labeled, and other things. In total, they checked 19 restaurants and 19 food items. The bureau also reminded restaurants to keep checking their own cleanliness. They told customers to choose well-known restaurants and to pay attention to how clean the whole place is.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau said that this year's checks on all-you-can-eat restaurants included 19 places that serve barbecue, hot pot, and skewers. Key things they checked were: if the business was registered, if they had insurance for their products, if they followed good rules for food hygiene, if they showed information about the food they served, and if they kept records of where their food came from. They also tested 19 items, including drinks, ready-to-eat foods, and wet rice or noodle products, to check their health standards.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau explained that they tested 19 food items: 6 ready-to-eat foods, 6 drinks or cold foods, 3 wet rice or noodle products, 2 beef dishes, and 2 pork dishes. The first test showed that one drink did not meet health standards. The restaurant was asked to improve, and then another test was done. This time, the drink passed the test.</p>
            <p>Also, five restaurants had small problems. For example, some food was not kept off the floor, some staff had not had health checks, or they did not write down the temperatures of their refrigerators. These businesses were told to fix these issues. After they made the changes, all five restaurants passed the re-check.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau wants to remind everyone that food can spoil quickly in hot summer weather. It is very important to make sure food is clean when it is being prepared. Restaurants should also make sure food is stored correctly and that staff, work areas, and equipment are clean. They must carefully check how food is made and its quality. They need to follow all food safety laws to keep food safe and healthy for everyone.</p>

            <h1>North Korea Rejects South Korea's Peace Efforts, Calls Them "Wishful Thinking"</h1>
            <p>Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said today that North Korea has never removed its loudspeakers used for spreading messages, and they will not do it in the future. She said that South Korea thinks North Korea is responding to its peaceful actions, but this is just "wishful thinking" from South Korea.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Kim Yo-jong is an important official in North Korea's Workers' Party. She said that changing the plans for the yearly military exercises between South Korea and the US is "pointless." She believes these exercises will not change the unfriendly nature of this group of countries.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Kim Yo-jong has strongly disagreed with South Korea's new government. This government has tried to make things less tense between North and South Korea. People in charge and experts believe that Kim Yo-jong speaks for her brother, Kim Jong Un.</p>
            <p>North Korea's state news agency, KCNA, reported that Kim Yo-jong said: "I believe Seoul's way of dealing with North Korea will not change, and it will never change."</p>
            <p>South Korea's military had said they saw North Korea's army taking down some loudspeakers that were pointed at South Korea. South Korea had done something similar earlier.</p>
            <p>After a time of high tension between the two Koreas, people in South Korea were carefully hopeful. They thought North Korea might be reacting well to President Lee Jae-myung's idea of talking with Pyongyang. Some even thought North Korea might want to start discussions again.</p>
            <p>Kim Yo-jong also stated that North Korea will not have talks with the United States. She said that any news reports about such talks are "wrong ideas."</p>
