            <h1>US H-1B Visa Fee Goes Up, Doctors Might Not Have to Pay More</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 22 â€“ The White House recently announced that the application fee for H-1B visas will increase to 100,000 US dollars. However, in some cases, people might not have to pay this fee if it is good for the country. Reports today say that doctors might be one group that does not have to pay the higher fee.</p>
            <p>On September 19, Donald Trump signed an order to raise the H-1B visa application fee to 100,000 US dollars (about 3.02 million New Taiwan Dollars). This new rule is already in effect.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that a Bloomberg News reporter wrote on social media platform X that White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said doctors might be among those who do not have to pay the increased fee.</p>

            <h1>Japanese City Sets Rule: Only 2 Hours of Mobile Phone Use Per Day</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, September 22 â€“ The city council of Toyoake, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, voted today to pass a new rule. This rule suggests that people should not use smartphones or similar devices for more than two hours a day, not including time for work, study, or housework. This is the first rule in Japan to set a limit on phone use for all citizens. It will start on October 1st. However, the rule is not mandatory, and there are no punishments if people don't follow it.</p>
            <p>According to reports from the Nikkei and Yomiuri newspapers, the Toyoake city government said that even though smartphones are very important for daily life, using them too much can cause people to not sleep enough. It can also mean less time with family, affecting the home environment, and slowing down the healthy growth of children. Because of these reasons, the city government suggested this rule to the city council. It encourages people to use smartphones, tablets, and game consoles for less than two hours a day, outside of work and housework.</p>
            <p>The city council voted on the rule this afternoon. Out of 19 council members (not including the speaker), 12 voted for it, and 7 voted against it. So, it passed with more votes.</p>
            <p>The Toyoake city government stated that this is the first rule in the country that sets a goal for mobile phone use time for all citizens. It will begin on October 1st.</p>
            <p>The rule applies to all citizens and children under 18 who go to school in the city. For children, it also sets times for using these devices: elementary school students until 9 PM, and middle school students and older until 10 PM. Families are asked to make their own rules. The rule is not mandatory, and there are no punishments.</p>
            <p>The city council also passed an extra decision. It says that the "2 hours a day" is just a suggestion and respects different ways of living and family situations. It also says that information should be given to citizens carefully and clearly to avoid misunderstandings. Lastly, the city should regularly check if the rule is working well and change it if needed.</p>
            <p>Toyoake City Mayor Masanori Kofuki said after the rule passed that "under 2 hours" is not a strict rule, but a guide.</p>
            <p>The Mainichi Shimbun reported that the idea for the rule started at a city government meeting in June this year. At that meeting, it was reported that some children who refused to go to school were staying up all night because they used their phones too much. Some could not even go to help centers. Because of this, Mayor Kofuki wanted to find a solution before the new school year in September, when cases of not going to school might increase. So, he presented the rule proposal at the city council meeting on August 25.</p>
            <p>Some people inside the government were worried that this rule would cause strong negative reactions online. However, an official explained that if they only gave "guidelines," it might be too weak, and no one would pay attention. So, they chose to make it a "rule" to make people talk about it on purpose.</p>
            <p>After the news about the rule passed, there was indeed a lot of criticism on social media. Some people online said, "This is the government getting involved too much," and "This is meddling." Some felt that even if the government made a standard, no one would listen. They thought that how phones are used should be decided by each family or person, based on age. However, some parents thought it was a good idea and could help them teach their children to avoid becoming addicted to phones.</p>
