News reports often say that foreigners are robbed in the Philippines. To make the area safer, the new Philippine Police Chief wants people to use the 911 hotline more often. Police will arrive in 5 minutes to help.

Since starting his job on June 2, Torre has strongly promoted the 911 police emergency line. When people call, they connect directly to their town's control center. The local center then tells the police station about the crime, and police on patrol nearby arrive within 5 minutes.

But the 5-minute response time plan has already shown good results. On the evening of June 26, there was a shooting outside a shopping mall. Police arrived in 5 minutes and caught two Chinese suspects who could not escape.

**EU Finally Approves Bulgaria to Join Eurozone, Making It the 21st Member**

Today, finance ministers from European Union (EU) countries finally agreed that Bulgaria can start using the Euro from January 1, 2026. This means Bulgaria will be the 21st country to join the Eurozone, which uses one currency.

According to Bloomberg News, the European Central Bank and the European Commission said last month that Bulgaria has met the rules to join the Eurozone. Today, EU finance ministers met and approved Bulgaria's request to join. Bulgaria is the poorest EU member, and using the Euro might bring more foreign tourists and money to the country.

However, many people in Bulgaria are not sure about this change. Problems like corruption, big differences in income, and political crises have made people trust their government less and less. Many are worried that prices will go up during the change to the Euro.

**30 Years Without Nuclear Power and No Carbon Reduction? Ministry Says Energy Change Also Improves Air**

A news column said that Taiwan has not reduced carbon in 30 years without nuclear power, and only talking about green energy will harm future generations. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said this is not true. They said that Taiwan's efforts to change its energy use are showing results. The goal is not only to reduce carbon but also to make the air cleaner and change how energy is used.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs Energy Administration said that Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 were 256.899 million tons. This is about 4.64% less than in 2005. This shows that carbon emissions are slowly going down because of recent plans to reduce carbon and save energy.

Taiwan has clear goals and a timeline for reducing carbon. By 2030, they aim to reduce emissions by 28% (plus or minus 2%) compared to 2005. Their goals are to get 30% of electricity from renewable sources, reduce coal power to 20%, and lower CO2 emissions per unit of electricity.
