            <h1>US, South Korea, Japan Military Drills: Kim Yo Jong Warns of Bad Results for the Three Countries</h1>
            <p>North Korea's state news agency reported today that Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, has warned the United States, South Korea, and Japan. She said their joint military exercises could bring "negative consequences" for them.</p>
            <p>South Korea's military stated that South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. will hold annual defense drills called "Freedom Edge" starting from September 15. These drills aim to make their air, sea, and cyber fighting skills better. This is to protect against North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile threats.</p>
            <p>Kim Yo Jong said through North Korea's official news agency (KCNA): "The three countries â€“ the U.S., Japan, and South Korea â€“ are carelessly showing their military power in the wrong place, which is near North Korea. This will certainly only bring bad results for themselves."</p>
            <p>South Korean media also reported that South Korea and the U.S. plan to hold "Iron Mace" war games next week. These games will combine their regular and nuclear fighting abilities to prepare for threats from North Korea.</p>
            <p>Pak Jong Chon, another high-level official from North Korea's Workers' Party, also released a statement through KCNA. He said that if "enemy forces" keep showing their military strength through these joint drills, North Korea will act with "clearer and stronger" counter-measures.</p>
            <p>Pyongyang has always said these joint drills are practice for invading North Korea. Sometimes, North Korea has responded by testing weapons. However, Seoul and Washington say these exercises are only for defense.</p>

            <h1>Nuclear Safety Council Plans for New Nuclear Energy with a 4-Year, NT$800 Million Research Project for SMRs and MMRs</h1>
            <p>President Lai has said that he will not rule out new types of nuclear energy. Because of this, the Nuclear Safety Council (NSC) will start a research project next year for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). This project will cost NT$100 million. It will help Taiwan create rules for SMRs and learn how to check their safety. The NSC has also planned a longer 4-year project that will cost NT$800 million. This project will cover safety technology for SMRs and Micro Modular Reactors (MMRs).</p>
            <p>The referendum about restarting Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 recently finished. Even though it did not get enough votes to pass, more people voted "yes" than "no" in all cities. In Hengchun, Pingtung County, where Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 is located, over 60% of people voted "yes." After the referendum, President Lai asked Taipower to check the old nuclear power plants. He also repeated that new nuclear energy is still a possible option.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the Nuclear Safety Council has been researching new nuclear energy. It is said that next year, they will introduce the "Low Carbon and High Energy Density Small Modular Reactor (SMR) Research Project." The National Atomic Energy Technology Institute will lead this project. It will need about NT$100 million, but the Legislative Yuan still needs to approve this money.</p>
            <p>In the future, the Nuclear Safety Council will plan a 4-year project. This project will help Taiwan develop safety skills for SMRs and Micro Modular Reactors (MMRs). The first estimated cost for this longer plan is around NT$800 million.</p>
            <p>An official said that next year's project will mainly focus on getting the technology needed to bring SMRs to Taiwan. This will give the government information and rules to make decisions about new nuclear energy. It will also help Taiwan create a process for getting SMR licenses and checking them. The goal is to train a national team for SMRs and make it faster to use SMRs. This will ensure Taiwan has many choices for its energy supply.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has been working towards becoming a "nuclear-free homeland" in recent years. This means there are fewer jobs for nuclear energy experts. To fix this, the National Atomic Energy Technology Institute plans to send students to research labs in Europe, America, and Japan for short study programs. They will also send students to famous universities to study nuclear engineering. The institute will also hire international experts or Taiwanese scholars who live abroad to bring new ideas and technologies to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>If private groups, including universities, want to bring in new nuclear reactors, the Nuclear Safety Council says that new reactor designs are still being developed around the world. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan are researching them, but they are not yet ready to be used commercially. The U.S. is also still making rules for these new types of reactors. The Nuclear Safety Council will carefully watch how international rules and laws develop in this area.</p>

            <h1>iPhone Air's Single Camera Has a New Feature: It Can Use Full Portrait Mode for the First Time</h1>
            <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series will be sold starting September 19. Some foreign media have noticed a special thing about the new iPhone Air. Even though it has only one camera to make it thin and light, this single camera can use the complete "Portrait Mode" feature. This is the first time an iPhone with just one camera can do this.</p>
            <p>Older iPhones with one camera on the back, like the iPhone XR released in 2018, and the cheaper iPhone SE models from 2020 and 2022, had Portrait Mode. However, they could only take portrait photos of people and pets. If you tried to take a photo of something else, like a flower or a landscape, Portrait Mode could not make the background blurry to highlight the main subject. The iPhone 16e, released in February this year, also had the same limit.</p>
            <p>But, a technology news website called 9to5Mac reported that the newest iPhone Air's single camera can now use the full Portrait Mode. This means it can take "next-generation" portrait photos of anything. You can also control how blurry the background is and change the focus. When you take a regular photo, the camera will automatically save information about the depth of the scene. So, if you forget to turn on Portrait Mode when you take the picture, you can still change it later.</p>
            <p>The Portrait photos on iPhone Air also use HDR (High Dynamic Range) technology. This means the phone quickly takes several photos with different light settings and then combines them. This helps to show more details in both the bright and dark parts of the picture. Also, photos taken in low light look better.</p>
            <p>9to5Mac said that some people might think having only one camera on the iPhone Air is a drawback. However, being able to use the complete Portrait Mode feature might make more people want to buy this phone.</p>
            <p>The iPhone Air has a 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR screen. It is only 5.6 millimeters thick, which is 0.2 millimeters thinner than a competitor, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. It also has a battery that lasts all day, allowing you to watch videos for up to 27 hours. It has the most Apple-designed computer chips ever, making it the thinnest and most energy-saving iPhone so far.</p>
