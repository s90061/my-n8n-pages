            <h1>13 Cities and Counties Get High Temperature Warning; Weather Expert Says to Watch for Tropical Disturbance</h1>
            <p>The weather office today announced a high temperature warning for 13 cities and counties. Greater Taipei might see temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius. Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that Typhoon Jianyu will become a medium typhoon today and land in Vietnam tomorrow. There is also a tropical disturbance forming east of the Philippines that needs to be watched.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University, wrote in his column today that the latest "Path Prediction Map" from the Central Weather Office shows that Typhoon Jianyu, the 13th typhoon, will become a medium typhoon today. Its center will pass near the southern coast of Hainan Island and land in Vietnam tomorrow afternoon.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong noted that another tropical disturbance is forming east of the Philippines. The latest European model shows that it will slowly become a typhoon in the South China Sea starting on the 27th and move west. Its future path will be similar to Typhoon Jianyu, but there is still a lot of uncertainty, so we need to keep watching.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the latest European model shows sunny and very hot weather everywhere today. Temperatures will be over 38 degrees Celsius, so people should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. There is a chance of scattered showers or thunderstorms in mountainous areas in the afternoon. Taitung and Pingtung might also have some short rain at times.</p>
            <p>The weather office today issued high temperature warnings. The weather in many places is hot. Taipei City and New Taipei City are under an "orange light," meaning there is a chance of extreme high temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius. Hsinchu County, Taichung City, Changhua County, Nantou County, Yunlin County, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County are also under an "orange light," meaning there is a chance of continuous temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. Taoyuan City is under a "yellow light," meaning people should be careful of temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the latest European model shows that from tomorrow until the 28th, most places will be sunny with some clouds and hot weather. People should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. Water vapor from the south will increase, so Hualien, Taitung, and Pingtung might have some short rain at times. The air will be unstable, so mountainous areas might have scattered showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon. Sometimes, heavy thunderstorms might also happen in southern flat areas.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also said that on the 29th and 30th, water vapor from the south will move north. Most places will be cloudy with some sun, and it will still be hot. Hualien, Taitung, and Pingtung will have more short local rain. All areas might have scattered showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon, with a chance of heavy thunderstorms.</p>

            <h1>Washington D.C. Run for Ukraine; People Wear Traditional Embroidered Shirts to Show National Strength</h1>
            <p>Before Ukraine's Independence Day, Washington D.C. held a charity run called "Vyshyvanka Run." People ran to show their hope for peace and freedom. They also wore "Vyshyvanka," which are traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirts. This showed their Ukrainian culture and their strong spirit during big changes in their lives.</p>
            <p>The "Vyshyvanka Run" was organized by a non-profit group called United Help Ukraine (UHU). More than a hundred supporters joined. These included Ukrainians living in Washington D.C. who care about the war back home, and Ukrainian Americans who brought their children. The place was full of blue and yellow colors. The run officially started after the host shouted, "Glory to Ukraine" (Slava Ukraini).</p>
            <p>The organizers said that by running, they celebrate Ukraine's Flag Day (August 23) and Independence Day (August 24). They want to keep sharing the values of democracy and freedom with the world. Ukraine declared its independence in 1991, and Independence Day is one of the most important holidays there.</p>
            <p>The "Vyshyvanka" is the main focus of the run. It is a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt and a symbol of the country. Each embroidery pattern has a special meaning and changes depending on the region. Its history goes back to the 9th century BC. The event felt like a small cultural festival, bringing people together through clothes and music.</p>
            <p>Maryna Baydyuk, the CEO of UHU, told the Central News Agency, "When the Ukrainian people fight for independence, we stand with them. Tomorrow is Ukraine's Independence Day, and they are still fighting for freedom and justice against Russia's attack."</p>
            <p>She also said that many American people joined the event. "They also believe in these values: Freedom is not free. Today we want to celebrate Ukraine's culture, history, and strength," she added.</p>
            <p>Anna, from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has lived in the U.S. for two years. She said, "Today is my hometown's birthday. I really admire the people who are still strong and staying there. I want to thank the U.S. for its support, and I hope Ukraine wins soon."</p>
            <p>Brandon, a Washington D.C. resident with Ukrainian family, came to the event with his two children. He said, "Supporting this event is very important to me. I also want my children to learn more about their background."</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for three and a half years. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently met with U.S. President Trump for the second time at the White House. People are watching to see how peace talks will start in the future. About this, Brandon said, "I have to stay hopeful. That's all I can do. I pray that things will get better."</p>
            <p>United Help Ukraine was started in 2014. It began with a group of people in Washington D.C. who joined rallies to support Ukraine. Now, it has become an important Ukrainian charity group in the entire U.S.</p>

            <h1>Haiti Is Very Poor and Troubled by Gangs; Organization of American States Asks for International Help</h1>
            <p>The Organization of American States (OAS) has asked for more money and help from other countries. This help is needed to make things better in Haiti, which is very poor, not stable for a long time, and has many problems with gang violence. The OAS also said that some South American countries are ready to send soldiers to help keep the peace.</p>
            <p>Albert Ramdin, the Secretary-General of the OAS, spoke to AFP in a video interview. He talked about the organization's plan released this week. This plan asks for help for Haiti, which is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
            <p>Because foreign help has failed many times and resources for Haiti have been wasted, Ramdin said, "We need to build trust again."</p>
            <p>Ramdin, who used to be the Foreign Minister of Suriname, said, "Canada and the United States have given a lot of help. But in Latin America, there is new interest in how to support Haiti."</p>
            <p>Many parts of Haiti, including most of its capital, Port-au-Prince, are still controlled by different armed gangs. Because of this, the OAS's new plan for help will focus on safety.</p>
            <p>A group of soldiers from many countries, led by Kenya, has been sent to Haiti to help the police. However, violent acts are still increasing quickly.</p>
            <p>Ramdin said that the OAS does not have the power to send peacekeepers. So, any group of soldiers sent "must be led by the United Nations or other countries." He added that some South American countries are willing to send soldiers.</p>
