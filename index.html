            <h1>Coast Guard Says Video of Chinese Warship Broadcast is Edited</h1>
            <p>A video is spreading online that shows a Chinese military ship and coast guard boat broadcasting messages while a Taiwan Coast Guard ship, called "Lianjiang," was chasing Chinese fishing boats. The Coast Guard Administration explained today that this video is made from two different events that happened at different times and places. They said the video was edited and put together in the wrong order, and they strongly disapprove of it.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration said in a press release this evening that from September 12 to 14, the "Lianjiang" ship from the Coast Guard Fleet Branch was patrolling the waters around Penghu. While patrolling 24 to 26 nautical miles outside Mudou Islet and Huayu in Penghu, they found Chinese fishing boats. They immediately used their broadcast system to tell the "Yuenanao 31067" and other Chinese fishing boats to leave Taiwan's waters.</p>
            <p>Also, on September 13 and 14, the "Lianjiang" ship found a Chinese military ship, "645," 28.6 nautical miles northwest of Mudou Islet, outside the special zone. The "Lianjiang" ship continued to watch the "645" military ship with a Navy ship. They did not pay attention to the "one China" messages broadcast by the "645" military ship.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration stated that watching the Chinese military ship "645" and chasing away Chinese fishing boats were two separate events that happened at different times and in different places.</p>
            <p>Regarding the online video that shows a Chinese military ship and coast guard boat broadcasting messages when the "Lianjiang" ship was chasing Chinese fishing boats, the Coast Guard Administration said that the video was created by editing and changing the order of videos of the "Lianjiang" ship doing its job. They want to make this clear.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration said that China is trying to make it look like the "Lianjiang" ship was stopped by a Chinese military ship while doing its job. They strongly criticize this type of misinformation. They also ask China to control its boats and not illegally enter Taiwan's waters.</p>
            <p>In addition, on September 6, the Coast Guard stopped and took control of a Chinese fishing boat with 15 people that had crossed into Taiwan's waters. They threw all 1 ton of illegally caught fish into the sea. The boat and its crew are now being investigated and will be fined according to the rules for people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration said they will continue to send large ships to guard the waters around Penghu. They will also work with the Penghu Coast Guard team to strongly stop Chinese fishing boats that cross the border. They will firmly protect Taiwan's national control and ocean rights, and make sure that ocean resources can be used for a long time.</p>

            <h1>Minister Chen Junne-jih Leads Agricultural Group to the US to Sign Purchase Letters</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that the "2025 Republic of China (Taiwan) Agricultural Products Trade Friendly Visit Group to the US" is led by Minister of Agriculture Chen Junne-jih. From today until September 27, the group will visit Washington D.C. and agricultural states in the US. They will sign letters of intent to buy agricultural products with related American associations. This will make their trade and food safety partnership stronger.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent out a press release this evening. It said that the "2025 Republic of China (Taiwan) Agricultural Products Trade Friendly Visit Group to the US" will visit Washington D.C. and important agricultural states in the US from today until September 27. They will sign letters of intent to buy agricultural products with relevant American agricultural associations. This is the 15th time since 1998 that Taiwan has organized an agricultural visit group to the US.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that this year, Minister of Agriculture Chen Junne-jih is leading the group. The group includes important people from Taiwan's plant oil refining industry, feed industry, flour industry, poultry meat marketing association, frozen food industry, and franchise promotion association. It also includes top representatives from the US Soybean Export Council, US Grains Council, and US Wheat Associates.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the group will first visit Washington D.C. After that, they will divide into three smaller groups for "Soybeans and Corn," "Wheat," and "Beef." These smaller groups will go to American agricultural states to meet and talk with local government officials and agricultural groups.</p>
            <p>The "Soybeans and Corn" group will visit Arkansas, Ohio, and Indiana. The "Wheat" group will visit South Dakota, Montana, and Idaho. The "Beef" group will visit Florida and Texas.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that Taiwan and the US have been working more closely in areas like new agricultural technology and food supply chains in recent years. American agricultural products are also popular with people in Taiwan. Last year, Taiwan was the eighth largest market for American exports, buying mainly agricultural and livestock products like soybeans, corn, wheat, and beef.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also hopes that by forming this agricultural visit group again, they can bring together the power of both public and private sectors in Taiwan. This will help agricultural cooperation and communication between the two countries. It will also further strengthen the trade and food safety partnership between Taiwan and the US.</p>

            <h1>US Secretary of State: Russian Drone Entering Polish Airspace Is Unacceptable</h1>
            <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that it was "an unfortunate and dangerous event" when a Russian drone entered Polish airspace earlier this week during attacks on Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Rubio said in Washington, D.C., "The question is whether these drones entered Poland on purpose. If there is proof that they did, then the situation will clearly become much more serious."</p>
            <p>On September 11, US President Trump suggested that the Russian drone might have "accidentally entered" Polish airspace. However, this idea worried many European countries.</p>
            <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk disagreed. He wrote on the social media platform X, "Of course, we also hope it was an accident, but that is not the truth, and we know it."</p>
            <p>Polish authorities said that on September 10, 17 Russian drones entered their eastern airspace and were shot down. Luckily, no one was hurt and there was no major damage. The remains of the drones have been found.</p>
            <p>It seems these drones were sent by Russia. Russia had previously said no to Trump's calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Poland is a member of NATO, and its safety is protected by the NATO alliance, which is led by the US.</p>
            <p>Many European countries and the European Union (EU) see this event as Russia testing how determined NATO is.</p>
