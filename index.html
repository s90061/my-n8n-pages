London (CNA) - A report from the Financial Times today said that top people at NVIDIA, a big company making AI chips, have sold more than $1 billion of their company shares in the last year.
The Financial Times stated that NVIDIA's leaders have been selling more shares recently. They are using the fact that people are excited about AI to turn their shares into money. As NVIDIA's stock price, which is based in California, went very high, they sold over $500 million worth of shares this month.
Documents from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, started selling his shares this week. This is the first time he has done this since September last year.
NVIDIA's stock price reached a new high on the 25th, making it the most valuable company in the world again. Experts had said that NVIDIA was ready for a "golden wave" of AI.
NVIDIA's recent rise in stock price shows that the U.S. stock market is again being led by AI-related companies. In recent years, hopeful feelings about this new technology have made chip company shares and related tech company shares go up a lot.
NVIDIA did not quickly answer Reuters' request for comments.
NVIDIA's stock price has gone up more than 60% since April 4th. At that time, Wall Street was affected by news that U.S. President Trump would put taxes on goods from other countries. Recently, the market thinks that the White House will make a trade deal to lower these taxes.

**Japan's H-2A Rocket Finishes Its Work, Launches Climate Satellite**

Tokyo (CNA) - Japan successfully launched a satellite today to watch climate change. It used its main rocket, the H-2A. This was the last time the H-2A rocket will be used. A newer rocket, the H3, will take its place because it costs less and is better for the world's space market.
The Associated Press said that the H-2A rocket took off from Japan's Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture. It carried the GOSAT-GW satellite. This is part of Tokyo's effort to help slow down climate change. About 16 minutes later, the satellite safely left the rocket and went into its planned path around Earth.
This was the 50th and last time the H-2A rocket has been launched. Since its first launch in 2001, the H-2A has been Japan's main rocket. It has sent satellites and probes into space with almost no problems.
After the H-2A stops working, Japan's new main rocket, the H3, will be used fully. The H3 is already working.
Hiroshi Yamakawa, the head of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), said in a press meeting, "For all of us who developed it at JAXA, this is a very exciting time."
GOSAT-GW stands for "Global Observing SATellite for Greenhouse gases and Water cycle." It will look at carbon, methane, and other gases that cause global warming in the air.
Japanese officials said that this satellite will start sending information to users around the world, like the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within one year. This information will include more detailed facts about the ocean's surface temperature and how much rain falls.
