            <h1>Reuters: OPEC+ Plans to Increase Oil Production in November</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported, citing sources, that OPEC+ (a group of oil-producing countries) might agree to increase oil production again in November. They already agreed to increase production earlier this month. The new increase would be at least 137,000 barrels per day.</p>
            <p>Sources said that eight main OPEC+ countries will have an online meeting on October 5th. They will decide how much oil to produce in November.</p>
            <p>OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed to produce more oil in a meeting earlier this month. This was more than a year earlier than they first planned.</p>
            <p>OPEC headquarters and Saudi Arabian officials have not yet answered Reuters' questions about this.</p>

            <h1>"Shovel Superheroes" Help Hualien Disaster Area; President Orders More Army Support</h1>
            <p>Hualien's Guangfu Township was badly damaged when water flowed out from a lake formed by a landslide in the Mata'an Stream. Many volunteers, called "Shovel Superheroes," came from everywhere to help clean up the mud. They were a beautiful sight. Today, President Lai Ching-te also ordered more soldiers to help with the recovery work. About 2,500 soldiers have already joined.</p>
            <p>On September 23rd, the Mata'an Stream landslide lake overflowed. The large amount of water broke the Mata'an Stream bridge. It also went over the banks and flooded villages and roads in Guangfu Township. The water was almost one story high in some places. Cars were underwater or washed away, and many people were trapped for a time. So far, at least 17 people have died, 7 are missing, and 100 are injured. The area is still under a red alert.</p>
            <p>Looking back at this serious disaster, the head of Dama Village in Guangfu Township, Wang Tzu-an, did a good job evacuating people. No one in the village was hurt or died. Lin Chin-shui, the head of Guangfu Township, said that in the future, they will check on all vulnerable households. This is to make sure that older people and those who need help get warnings and leave safely, so this kind of sad event doesn't happen again.</p>
            <p>## More Than 500 People Still in Shelters; County Government Sets Up Supply Stations</p>
            <p>Today, the Hualien County Government held a meeting to explain the progress of the rescue work for the Mata'an Stream landslide lake disaster. Chen Chien-tsun, the head of the Administration and Research and Evaluation Department, said that 547 people are staying in shelters. 223 people are at Dajin Elementary School, 53 at Daquan Township Nursery, and 271 at Huye Hot Spring Hotel.</p>
            <p>The county government said that 341 households have no water. 4,378 households had no water at some point, and 92.21% now have water again. The ninth branch of the Taiwan Water Corporation will provide 20 mobile water supply vehicles. In Guangfu Township, 21 water stations will be set up. You can find more information on the "Hualien County Government Mata'an Stream Landslide Lake Information Area" website.</p>
            <p>The county government said that donated goods include drinking water, food, baby and adult milk powder, baby and adult diapers, cold medicine, basic first-aid items, clothes, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, and slippers. The actual items available depend on what is at the site. The "Hualien County Government Supply Receiving and Distribution Station" is at the parking lot behind No. 19 Tangchang Street, Guangfu Township. For large amounts of goods, please go to the large warehouse behind the same location to register and pick them up.</p>
            <p>After the disaster, people faced sudden changes in their lives and emotional stress. The Hualien County Health Bureau set up "comfort care stations." As of September 27th, they had helped people 217 times. 199 times at the Dajin Elementary School comfort station and 18 times at the Ruisui Life Park comfort station.</p>
            <p>People are also worried about the education of students at Guangfu Junior High School. The Education Department explained the current cleaning and recovery work at the school. As of 10 AM today, offices and classrooms on the first floor of the teaching building are still being cleaned. The area from the side gate to the basketball court has been cleared of mud. The road from the main gate to the teaching building is now open. Half of the path from the school gate to the teaching building, activity center, and dormitories has been cleared of mud. The soccer field is 1/5 finished. They have also contacted a company to set up 8 portable toilets.</p>
            <p>## False Alarms Cause Two Disturbances in Guangfu Disaster Area Today</p>
            <p>The Central Disaster Emergency Operation Center said today that the area is still under a red alert. In the future, they will use tsunami-like alarms to warn people to leave.</p>
            <p>Earlier today in Guangfu Township, a false rumor about a dam breaking caused panic in the town. The Ninth River Management Office of the Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, explained that engineers were trying to divert water in the river. They believe there is no danger now and asked people not to panic.</p>
            <p>The Central Disaster Emergency Operation Center also said that after checking, there was no large amount of lake water flowing down or landslides. If anything unusual happens, a tsunami air-raid warning will be issued.</p>
            <p>The Eastern Branch of the Coast Guard Administration said that at that time, engineers were trying to divert the river. But this was misunderstood. On the disaster site roads, fire department vehicles first turned on their alarms to warn people to be careful. For safety, Coast Guard vehicles also turned on their warning lights. This was to remind people passing by to be careful. They made this clear.</p>
            <p>Then in the afternoon, the Hualien County Police Bureau had a false alarm. The police explained in a press release that a police officer from the county police bureau, who was on duty at the Central Emergency Operation Center Coordination Office, misunderstood the commander's instructions during a meeting. The officer thought that if the flood reached a red alert, a tsunami warning should be issued immediately, when the instruction was "if the flood reaches a red alert, report it immediately."</p>
            <p>The county police bureau said that the officer then used the Water and Soil Conservation Bureau's information showing a red alert. He told the Fenglin Precinct's Changqiao Police Station and Guangfu Police Substation of the county police bureau to issue a tsunami warning and help people evacuate. However, according to rules, the county police bureau can only issue a tsunami warning after being told by the Forestry Bureau. The officer gave the wrong information without checking first, which caused panic among the public.</p>
            <p>The county police bureau said that they will review this mistake and hold the people responsible to account.</p>
            <p>## Government Increases Relief Funds; Aims for Livable Conditions in 14 Days</p>
            <p>The flood disaster from the Mata'an Stream landslide lake in Hualien caused serious damage. Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai visited the disaster area in Guangfu Township. He announced that the comfort payment for each person who died would increase from 800,000 to 1,000,000 NT dollars. For those seriously injured, it would be 250,000 NT dollars. If houses were filled with mud, each household would get 100,000 NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also said that the search for the 7 missing people will continue. The red alert will not be lifted yet. They have started a program called "Safe Home, Government Pays." He also asked that basic living conditions be restored within 14 days.</p>
            <p>The President said today that to help disaster victims return to normal life quickly, he called Minister of National Defense Gu Li-hsiung this morning. He ordered more soldiers to help with the recovery work after the disaster. About 2,500 soldiers have already been sent. Around the same number of soldiers are expected to take over on September 30th. The goal is to finish the mud clearing work in Guangfu Township before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
            <p>The Army Command Headquarters released a press release this evening. It said that to help people in the Hualien disaster area rebuild their homes faster, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th combat areas are still working hard on rescue efforts. They have sent about 2,500 soldiers and 357 pieces of equipment for the recovery mission. This includes 17 types of equipment like UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters and drones. They aim to finish the recovery as quickly and effectively as possible, showing the Army's promise and action to protect the public.</p>
            <p>## Ministry of Transportation Provides Daily Shuttle Buses to Help "Shovel Superheroes" Reach Disaster Area</p>
            <p>Due to the flood from the Mata'an Stream landslide lake, "Shovel Superheroes" from all over are helping to clear mud. Yesterday, over 10,000 people helped, and today, even more are expected. To speed up the rescue work and make sure help can get through, traffic control in Guangfu Township will change starting now. The county government asks people to make way for rescue vehicles.</p>
            <p>The Directorate General of Highways said today that starting now, 6 large buses will be provided daily at Xincheng, Hualien, Ji'an, Shoufeng, and Yuli stations. These buses will take volunteers to the affected areas. Minister of Transportation Chen Shih-kai also visited Hualien again today.</p>
            <p>Local people who volunteered as "Shovel Superheroes" have come to Guangfu Township, bringing new energy to the cleanup and rebuilding after the disaster. Premier Cho Jung-tai said he thanks all these volunteers. He said they show the world how important the connection between people in Taiwan is. He also said that care and matching volunteers to tasks should be done well.</p>
            <p>For matching volunteers, the Hualien County Government has released a "Disaster Recovery Volunteer Recruitment Form." You can fill it out from September 28th to October 2nd. Or you can call the volunteer matching hotline at (0975-769035), which is open 24 hours. For questions at Guangfu Station for volunteers, you can call "0972-223409, 0972-223410."</p>
