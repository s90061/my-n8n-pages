            <h1>Fake Line Account of Hsu Chen-Wei Leads to Investment Scam Groups; Hualien Police Investigate</h1>
            <p>Hualien police have received many reports from people. They got Line messages from accounts pretending to be County Mayor Hsu Chen-Wei. These accounts invited them to join "County Mayor's special investment groups." The Hualien County Police Bureau said they have started an investigation. No one has lost money yet. They are telling people to be careful and recognize these scam methods.</p>
            <p>People told the police that they received friend requests on Line from an account claiming to be "Hsu Chen-Wei." At first, the account sent nice "good morning" pictures and asked friendly questions. Later, it invited them to join a "County Mayor's special investment group" or an "internal special finance group." It said they could get secret information and guaranteed high profits.</p>
            <p>Some people who added the account received messages where the "County Mayor" asked about their work. The account then asked them to "learn about the government's poverty relief plan." All these conversations eventually led to an invitation to join an investment group.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government quickly said today that this account is fake. They stated that the County Mayor does not add people on Line, invite them to invest, ask for their bank account details, or ask for donations. They urge people to be very careful.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Police Bureau also released news, saying they started an investigation after receiving reports. They have not yet received any reports of people being scammed. Scam groups use pictures and names of famous people to create fake accounts. If people think they are being scammed, they should stop talking to the account immediately. They should call the 165 anti-fraud hotline or ask the police for help.</p>

            <h1>Study: Pollution or Environmental Changes May Cause Gender Change in Australian Birds</h1>
            <p>A study from an Australian university has found something surprising: many wild birds in Australia are changing their gender. Scientists think that more pollution or other environmental reasons might be causing this.</p>
            <p>The study looked at 5 common Australian birds, like kookaburras, magpies, and lorikeets. It found that about 6% of these birds had chromosomes that showed one gender, but their body parts for making babies were of the other gender.</p>
            <p>Researchers from the University of Sunshine Coast in Australia said that the study showed a surprisingly large number of birds changed their gender after they were born.</p>
            <p>Dominique Potvin, one of the researchers, said, "This shows that gender in wild birds is more flexible than we thought. This change can even happen when birds are adults."</p>
            <p>The study tested the DNA of almost 500 birds. Most of the time, the birds were genetically female but developed male reproductive organs.</p>
            <p>Potvin also said, "We also found one kookaburra that was genetically male. But its reproductive system was active, and it had big eggs and tubes for eggs. This means it had recently laid eggs."</p>
            <p>It is well known that some reptiles and fish can change gender. But it is very rare for wild birds and mammals to change gender.</p>
            <p>Scientists have seen that pollution and even warm temperatures can cause frogs to change gender.</p>
            <p>The study from the University of Sunshine Coast said that they do not know why wild birds are changing gender. However, it might be because of things in the environment. For example, chemicals that change hormones can build up in natural areas.</p>
            <p>Potvin added that "understanding how and why gender changes is very important for protecting birds and making bird research more accurate."</p>
            <p>This study was published this week in a science journal called "Biology Letters."</p>

            <h1>Criminal Investigation Bureau Shuts Down "Lineage" Private Server; Operated for 15 Years, Made 5 Billion NTD</h1>
            <p>The Criminal Investigation Bureau found four people, led by a man named Cai, and also Chinese criminals. They made an illegal game server for the famous game "Lineage." This illegal server was called "Hancheng Lineage." Police estimate that in 15 years, this illegal server caused losses of up to NT$5 billion to the original game company. Thousands of players played on it every day. The police have sent the case to the prosecutor for breaking copyright laws and trademark laws.</p>
            <p>The Criminal Investigation Bureau's Intellectual Property Investigation Team recently received a report from the game company Gamania. Gamania said that the "Hancheng Lineage" private server illegally copied their famous game "Lineage." It used their game content, pictures, and other materials. It also used Gamania's, the Korean original company's, and "Lineage" trademarks when the game started. The game content and look were exactly the same. This seriously hurt Gamania's copyrights and trademarks.</p>
            <p>After getting the report, the Criminal Investigation Bureau quickly formed a special team with police from New Taipei, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. They got permission from the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. The special team spent one year looking into the case. They found that Cai's group in Taiwan was in charge of running the server. They set up the private game server in a computer room in Xinzhuang. The criminals in China provided technical help and managed the server from far away. They sold virtual items in the game to make illegal money.</p>
            <p>The Criminal Investigation Bureau's Intellectual Property Investigation Team held a press conference today. They said that "Hancheng Lineage" operated from 2010 until March of this year. Thousands of players connected to it every day.</p>
            <p>After gathering enough proof, the police carried out two search operations. These happened on March 27 and May 14 of this year in 9 places in Kaohsiung City, Taipei City, and New Taipei City. They arrested 4 people, including Mr. Cai. They took 6 "Hancheng Lineage" server computers, over NT$1.15 million in cash, and many other items. The estimated value of the copyright and trademark violations is NT$5 billion. The whole case has been sent to the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office for breaking copyright law and trademark law.</p>
