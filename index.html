            <h1>UK Prime Minister Promises to Share All Official Testimonies in Spy Case</h1>
            <p>A spy problem in the British Parliament is still ongoing. Today, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Parliament that he will fully release the information given by the Deputy National Security Advisor to the lawyers.</p>
            <p>A former assistant to a Member of Parliament, Chris Cash, was accused of spying for China. In September, the lawyers suddenly stopped the case, which made people ask questions.</p>
            <p>Cash was arrested in 2023. At that time, he was the head of the "China Research Group" (CRG). This group had strong views against China and helped change laws and rules. Cash's arrest was a big shock to British politics and to people working on China-related issues.</p>
            <p>Cash and another suspect, Chris Berry, were both arrested in 2023. Then, in April 2024, they were formally accused.</p>
            <p>The Royal Prosecution Service (CPS) stopped the case in September this year. People thought that politics might have been involved. Some believed that important officials, like the current National Security Advisor, put pressure on the Deputy National Security Advisor. They wanted him to avoid saying that China was a "threat" to the UK or that China was an "enemy country" by British law. This was done to "avoid making Beijing angry."</p>
            <p>Cash and Berry were accused when the Conservative Party was in charge. The Labour Party won the national election last July. The Deputy National Security Advisor, Matthew Collins, gave information to the lawyers in December 2023, and again in February and July of this year.</p>
            <p>Tom Tugendhat, a Member of Parliament, asked today why Prime Minister Starmer did not blame the lawyers if the case was stopped because there was not enough proof. Tugendhat used to lead the CRG and the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament. He was also a security minister when the Conservative Party was in charge.</p>
            <p>Also, Starmer and other government officials have repeatedly said they did not get involved in the Deputy National Security Advisor's testimony. But Tugendhat asked if high-ranking government officials might have secretly told civil servants what to say. This could have made them give information that matched a certain goal, which then stopped the case from going to trial.</p>
            <p>Starmer, who was the main lawyer for 5 years, said that there was absolutely no such secret guidance. He also said that when he was the main lawyer, even when the Conservative Party was in power, he "never" faced any kind of political pressure.</p>
            <p>Starmer made it clear that the justice system in the UK is independent, and this is a tradition the UK is proud of. He said that he will always work to keep this tradition, both when he was the main lawyer and now as Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>The current government has said many times that the decision not to take the spy case to trial was made by the lawyers themselves.</p>
            <p>Today, Starmer said again that he was "very disappointed" that the case did not go to trial. He also criticized the Conservative Party for not changing laws quickly enough. It took them 8 years, from 2015 to 2023, to finish passing the new "National Security Act."</p>
            <p>The 2023 "National Security Act" was supported by all political parties in the UK Parliament. It gives security and legal groups better tools to fight spy threats more effectively.</p>
            <p>Starmer said that since the lawyers explained last night that the government can decide whether to share the Deputy National Security Advisor's testimony, he decided to release all of it after carefully thinking about it this morning.</p>
            <p>Starmer said that after doing the "short" legal steps, like telling the people involved in the testimony, the government will release the testimony very soon.</p>

            <h1>Evergreen Airlines Apologizes After Asking for Sick Leave Proof from Flight Attendant Who Died</h1>
            <p>An Evergreen flight attendant passed away after working while sick and returning to Taiwan. It was reported that the company sent a message asking her to provide proof for family care leave. Today, Evergreen Airlines said they helped the employee with her leave requests when she was in the hospital. They apologized for the mistake, saying it happened because an employee was not fully familiar with the work.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Airlines stated they will quickly find out exactly what happened. The Taoyuan City Labor Inspection Office recently checked the airline. They found that working hours and rest times followed labor laws. Evergreen Airlines did not stop flight attendants from taking time off. However, some types of leave can affect a person's work review.</p>
            <p>There were reports that after the flight attendant died, she received a message on her phone from an Evergreen Airlines employee. The message asked if she had already given the document for her family care leave on September 27th and reminded her to do so. Evergreen Airlines responded in writing, saying they are very sorry for causing trouble to the family.</p>
            <p>The company said they helped with leave applications when the employee was in the hospital. This error happened because an employee was not familiar with their duties. Evergreen Airlines will carefully check and improve its processes, and they again offer their deepest apologies to the family.</p>

            <h1>Israeli Couple, Held by Hamas for 2 Years, Finally Reunite to "Heal Together"</h1>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel. An Israeli couple, Avinatan Or and Noa Argamani, were taken captive. After being apart for 738 days, Argamani, who was freed first, finally met her boyfriend again. She wrote a heartfelt message, saying, "It's time to start healing together."</p>
            <p>Reports from BBC and Reuters say that Or, 32, and his girlfriend Argamani, 28, were kidnapped at the Nova Music Festival. A terrifying video of Argamani being pulled onto the back of a motorcycle became one of the most recognized images of the attack.</p>
            <p>On June 8, 2024, Israeli special forces rescued Argamani. Or, who was held in a different place in the middle of the Gaza Strip, was freed on October 13 this year.</p>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump helped arrange a ceasefire between Israel and the armed group Hamas. This agreement led to Hamas releasing 20 Israeli hostages who were still alive, and Or was one of them.</p>
            <p>The day after her partner was freed, Argamani posted an emotional message in Hebrew on Instagram. She also shared their first photos together since 2023.</p>
            <p>She wrote, "Two years have passed since I last saw Avinatan, my love. Two years ago, terrorists kidnapped us. They pushed me onto a motorcycle and forcefully separated us in front of the whole world."</p>
            <p>Argamani explained that she was kept in a house with other women and children, while her boyfriend was held in a tunnel. She added, "Hamas showed videos and signs that I was alive, but there was no news about Avinatan."</p>
            <p>She said that they can now begin to recover. "We won our personal fight, and the whole world fought with us to make this moment happen. Now is the time for us to start our future life together."</p>
            <p>Argamani also thanked Trump for helping Israeli hostages come home and for helping them "overcome the darkness."</p>
            <p>Or's father, Yaron Or, said in an interview that his son had "very little food" while he was a prisoner. For long periods, he was alone, tied with chains in tunnels or small areas. Or, who is almost 200 cm tall, was once held in a space only 1.8 meters high and just a bit longer than his bed.</p>
            <p>Yaron told reporters that during those days, his son had "no books to read, no one to talk to, nothing." He was only given a Rubik's Cube to pass the time. He knew almost nothing about the outside world. He didn't know where his girlfriend was, and he didn't know all the details about the Hamas attack and Israel's response afterward.</p>
            <p>Yaron said that his son's guards had family members who died in Israeli army air attacks. "I think it's amazing they didn't hurt him," he said. Only one time, when he tried to escape and was caught, was he beaten.</p>
            <p>The father also mentioned that his son is now very thin. "His body still needs to get better, but mentally, thank God, he is still the Avinatan we know â€“ just as funny and strong."</p>
