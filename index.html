            <h1>Keelung Home Ceiling Falls Down, Engineer Thinks It's Because of Rusted Metal Bars</h1>
            <p>On August 28, a concrete ceiling suddenly fell down in the living room of a third-floor apartment. This apartment is in a five-story building on Baishan Road in Qidu District, Keelung City. Luckily, no one was hurt. Today, a civil engineer checked the place. He said the problem might be because the metal bars inside the ceiling rusted. Also, new tiles were put on the fourth-floor, which added more weight. It is not yet clear if the 6.0-magnitude earthquake near Yilan the night before was a reason for the collapse.</p>
            <p>The engineer found that the rusted metal bars in the third-floor ceiling might have too much chloride. This would mean the building is a "sea sand house." They need to do more tests to be sure. The floor between the third and fourth floors is now dangerous and needs to be removed quickly. The building got its permit in 1987, so it is 38 years old. After checking, the city government said the whole building is not in immediate danger. However, they will help with a full safety check later.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Parliament Ends Its Longest Session, Speaker Asks All Parties to Work Together</h1>
            <p>Today was the last meeting of the 11th Legislative Yuan's third session. The Speaker, Han Kuo-yu, said that even though different political parties had different ideas, they still passed many important laws. These laws will help the country and its people. The next session will start next week. He asked all parties to forget their disagreements and work together to solve the problems Taiwan is facing, both inside and outside the country.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting ended at 4:50 PM, Han Kuo-yu spoke. He thanked all the party leaders and members of parliament. He said that even with different ideas, they worked together. They talked and agreed on many important laws that help people. He said the parliament passed 77 important items. These included 41 laws, 18 budget plans, 4 reconsideration requests, 1 approval for a person, 1 rule for the parliament, and 12 other items.</p>
            <p>He explained that one very important thing they passed was a special law and budget. This was for rebuilding after Typhoon Danas and the heavy rains on July 28. He said that because all the party leaders and members of parliament worked hard, this was passed quickly. It will be used for rebuilding in the disaster areas, which is very meaningful. Han Kuo-yu asked again for everyone to remember that democracy is precious. He said that respecting each other, having less anger, staying calm, and talking nicely are important for democracy. He asked all parties to put their differences aside and work together to find solutions for Taiwan's challenges in the next session. He also thanked the staff of the Legislative Yuan and all government departments for their hard work to help the country and its people. After that, he announced the meeting was over.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Premier Cho Jung-tai and others went to shake hands with the members of parliament. Han Kuo-yu also went down from his seat to shake hands with Premier Cho Jung-tai, and they took a picture together. The normal meeting times for the Legislative Yuan are from February to the end of May, and from September to the end of December. But this session was extended twice. The first time was until July 31, and the second time was until August 31. This made it the longest session ever.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Army Starts New Drone Unit, Experts Hope It Will Make Important Rules</h1>
            <p>The Army has created a new group called the "Air Defense and Unmanned Systems Unit." Experts said today that the Army will probably use drones the most. They think this new unit should play a big role in creating important rules for how the Army uses drones. They even hope the unit will think of new ways to use technology. This will help make the army stronger with automatic systems, especially when there are fewer soldiers in the future.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of National Defense released a report. It said that to prepare for future wars, the Army has changed its structure. It has added new groups like the "Air Defense and Unmanned Systems Unit." This is part of getting new weapons like drones and making changes to military service. These changes will help build a modern army. Su Tzu-yun, an expert from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said this is how the Army is preparing for different kinds of fights. He explained that the Navy and Air Force use unmanned tools for bigger plans, but the Army will use them in more everyday fighting. This means soldiers in small groups like squads and platoons might use drones. So, the Army will use these tools in the widest range of situations.</p>
            <p>Su Tzu-yun said that the war between Russia and Ukraine showed that drones are used up very quickly. So, the Army needs to buy many cheap drones. Besides flying drones, the Army should also include unmanned vehicles. Su Tzu-yun also said that the Army's new unit will work with other Army groups, like those that make training rules and military schools. Together, they will choose good drones and create important rules for how to use them.</p>
            <p>Shu Hsiao-huang, another expert, thinks the report on military changes helps tell people and the parliament about the army's plans against current threats. He noted that China's military is developing advanced, stealthy, and automatic equipment. Because Taiwan faces big challenges, the war in Ukraine has shown new problems for Taiwan's main weapons and fighting methods. Therefore, it is important for the Army to have a special "Air Defense and Unmanned Systems Unit."</p>
            <p>Shu Hsiao-huang explained that different parts of the military need different kinds of drones. For example, the Air Force needs drones that can watch large areas of air and sea for a long time. The Navy needs drones to help find targets for anti-ship missiles. The Army needs drones to fight beyond what soldiers can see. These drones would be used by larger units like brigades and battalions, or even in small fighting groups. They would send information back to shooting units to help them attack. Shu Hsiao-huang also said that when Chinese ships are moving, Taiwan's military might have trouble attacking them. At that time, the Chinese army might not have strong defenses. So, drones can be a powerful weapon to fight back. He suggested that this Army unit should develop different rules for different Army groups. It should also think of new ways to use technology to make the army stronger with automatic systems, especially when there are fewer soldiers in the future.</p>
