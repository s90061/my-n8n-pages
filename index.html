            <h1>Starbucks in the U.S. Uses AI, Employees Spend Less Time in Storage and More Time with Customers</h1>
            <p>The international coffee chain Starbucks announced today that by the end of September, it will use an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system for checking inventory in over 11,000 of its stores in North America. This is to make its supply chain work better.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this system allows Starbucks employees to scan shelves with a handheld tablet. The software automatically counts items and marks those that are running low.</p>
            <p>Deb Hall Lefevre, Starbucks' Chief Technology Officer, said in a statement that this system helps to restock items faster. It also makes sure that popular ingredients like cold foam, oat milk, and caramel sauce are always available.</p>
            <p>Lefevre wrote in the statement that customers can always get the drinks they want. Also, employees can spend less time in the back storage area and more time making drinks and talking to customers at the counter.</p>
            <p>Lefevre added that this new technology is already being used in thousands of stores. It has made checking inventory eight times more frequent.</p>

            <h1>UN Worries North Korea May Be Doing Medical Experiments on People with Disabilities</h1>
            <p>Today, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that there is believable information. This information suggests that North Korea is doing medical experiments on people with disabilities. They are also forcing disabled people to have operations so they cannot have children, and they are killing disabled babies.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said these experiments are happening in places for children's care and in detention centers. People involved did not give their free and full permission.</p>
            <p>The Committee stated, "There is believable information that North Korea is doing medical and scientific experiments on people who have mental or intellectual disabilities."</p>
            <p>The Committee also shared its concern about reports of women with disabilities being forced to have operations to stop them from having children, and forced abortions. They are also "very worried about reliable information regarding the killing of disabled children, including reports of babies being killed in medical facilities with official approval."</p>
            <p>Mara Gabrilli, a member of the Committee, said that the Committee has asked North Korea's government to immediately make all such experiments illegal. They also want to make sure that these facilities are watched by independent groups. Furthermore, they want a system to give help to those who have been harmed.</p>
            <p>This report from the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities about North Korea was created using information from a UN special reporter who visited North Korea in 2017. It also includes information from people who left North Korea and other secret reports.</p>
