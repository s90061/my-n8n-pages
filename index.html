            <p>New York (Central News Agency) â€“ Oil prices went down a lot today. They reached their lowest point since May.

            <h1>China Limits Rare Earth Exports, Trump Announces 100% Tax from November</h1>
            <p>Washington (Central News Agency) â€“ Former US President Donald Trump said today that he will put a 100% tax on more goods from China. This will start on November 1st. He said this because China is controlling its rare earth minerals exports in a "very strong" way.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Trump stated that the new taxes and US rules on "all important software" exports will start on November 1st. This is a response to what he called Beijing's "very strong" actions.</p>
            <p>He wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," "It is hard to believe China would do such a thing, but they did, and the results are clear."</p>
            <p>A few hours before, Trump unexpectedly posted that he would increase taxes on China. At that time, he wrote that China had sent letters to many countries around the world. These letters explained the export controls on rare earth minerals.</p>
            <p>Currently, goods from China have a 30% US tax. Trump put this tax in place because Beijing did not stop the illegal trade of the drug fentanyl and because of unfair trade actions.</p>
            <p>In return, China currently has a 10% tax on US goods.</p>
