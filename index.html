            <h1>Taipower: Typhoon Repair Efforts are Real, Not Staged Photos</h1>
            <p>Taipower said today that their workers' hard work during typhoon repairs should not be called "staged photos." They said that real photos taken at the work sites show true repairs, not staged ones. This was in response to a claim by the Taiwan Power Industry Union. Taipower added that the Taiwan Power Labor Union has almost 29,000 members, which is over 99% of their workers. This union represents most of the workers' ideas. The Power Industry Union only has about a hundred members.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in Southern Taiwan. Today, the Taiwan Power Industry Union said in a statement that basic workers had to work many extra hours to fix the damage. They also said workers were asked to pose for photos while eating. The union believes the government used these photos to promote its plan to give Taipower a lot of money.</p>
            <p>Taipower stated in a press release tonight that all the repair photos they released were real pictures taken randomly by workers during the actual repairs. There were no orders or requests to stage photos. Sometimes, when news reporters came to film, they might have asked workers to help a little for their reports.</p>
            <p>Taipower said they understand and respect that their employees care about their working conditions. This typhoon caused damage to power systems in the Chiayi-Tainan area that has never happened before. Nearly 3,500 power poles fell down or broke. More than 10,000 people have worked to fix the problems, and they are still working now.</p>
            <p>Taipower said the company gives its deepest respect and thanks for all the hard work its employees have done. They will also continue to make working conditions better for repairs, like giving bonuses, special holidays, and danger pay. They hope the public will keep encouraging the frontline workers.</p>

            <h1>Israel Bombs Syrian Military Base, Warns Against Attacking Druze People</h1>
            <p>Today, Israel bombed a Syrian military building in Damascus. This happened after Israel warned the Syrian government, which is led by Islamists. Israel told them to leave the Druze minority group alone in Sweida province, which is their main area.</p>
            <p>A group that watches the situation said that fighting between different groups in Sweida province, in southern Syria, has killed nearly 250 people.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that more than 100 people died in fights between the Druze people and local Bedouin tribes. Syrian government soldiers entered Sweida city yesterday. This city has mostly Druze people. The government said they were there to check on a ceasefire agreement made with Druze leaders.</p>
            <p>But witnesses said that government soldiers and Bedouin people worked together to attack Druze fighters and regular people. They killed many people in the city.</p>
            <p>Government soldiers and Druze fighters had also fought in April and May in Sweida province and near Damascus. Over 100 people died then. This recent fighting is the worst violence since those earlier battles.</p>
            <p>Since December last year, when former President Bashar al-Assad was removed from power, there has been tension. The current Syrian government, led by Islamists, has had problems with religious and ethnic minority groups.</p>
            <p>Israel's Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, told the government in Damascus to "not interfere with the Druze people in Sweida province."</p>
            <p>He demanded that the Syrian army leave. Katz promised that Israeli forces would keep attacking until they do. Katz clearly stated that if this message is not understood, Israel will "increase its response against the Syrian government."</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Israeli army said they had attacked the Syrian military headquarters.</p>
