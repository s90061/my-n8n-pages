Experts from the World Economic Forum believe that artificial intelligence (AI) will significantly change the world of work in the next few years. While AI might cause some jobs to disappear, it is also expected to create many new ones. By 2027, about 2.4 million existing jobs could be lost, but around 2 million new jobs requiring new skills are likely to appear. This means that workers will need to learn new abilities, especially in technology and problem-solving, to prepare for these changes. The report suggests that training and education will be very important for people to adapt and find opportunities in this evolving job market. Companies and governments are encouraged to invest in programs that help employees gain these necessary skills.

**Venice Introduces Fee to Manage Day-Trippers**

The Italian city of Venice has started charging a fee for day visitors to help manage the large number of tourists. This new rule, which began in late April 2024, requires day-trippers to pay a 5 euro fee during peak times. The aim is to reduce overcrowding and protect the city's delicate historical and cultural sites, which are struggling under the weight of mass tourism. Residents, commuters, and tourists staying overnight are exempt from the fee. This move is an effort to find a balance between welcoming visitors and ensuring the city remains livable for its local population. Officials hope the fee will encourage more sustainable tourism and better protect Venice for future generations.

**Rising Costs Change Daily Spending Habits**

Families and individuals are changing how they spend money as the cost of living continues to rise around the world. High inflation means that everyday items like food, energy, and transport are becoming more expensive. Many people are now looking for ways to save money, such as buying cheaper brands, cooking more at home instead of eating out, and cutting down on non-essential purchases. Businesses, especially small ones, are also feeling the impact as consumers reduce their spending. This situation is affecting people's daily lives and requiring them to make careful choices about their budgets to manage these financial pressures.`;
