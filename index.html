            <h1>Gunman on Campus at Villanova University, Pennsylvania; Students and Public Urged to Lock Doors and Seek Shelter</h1>
            <p>Police in the United States received a report today about a gunman on the campus of Villanova University in Pennsylvania. The university is preparing for the new school year. It has gained more attention this year because it is the former school of the new Catholic Pope Leo XIV.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, students received a text message from Villanova University's alert system. It told them to lock and block their doors and windows and move to a safe place. A second alert from school staff told everyone to stay away from the law school.</p>
            <p>Officials from Radnor Township posted on social media platform X. They told nearby residents and students to stay indoors for safety. The post did not give more information.</p>
            <p>Videos shared on social media showed a group of people being quickly led into a building on campus. Orientation and registration for new students started today and will continue until the 23rd. The school year begins on the 25th.</p>
            <p>Pennsylvania Representative Lisa Borowski's area includes Villanova. She said she received text messages from Radnor Township police and Villanova University campus police around 5 PM. These messages asked local residents to stay in a safe place indoors.</p>
            <p>Borowski stated, "I am very worried and very concerned."</p>

            <h1>UN Calls for US to Stop Punishing ICC Judges and Remove All Sanctions</h1>
            <p>The United Nations today asked the United States to stop taking action against judges of the International Criminal Court (ICC). This happened after the US government announced punishments against four judges yesterday. The ICC had previously issued an arrest warrant for the Israeli Prime Minister and started an investigation into US military members in Afghanistan for possible war crimes.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the US yesterday put more sanctions on two ICC judges and two prosecutors. These people were even from allied countries like France and Canada. Many see this as a way for the US to weaken the international court's investigation into Israel.</p>
            <p>Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement, "The United States must stop its ongoing actions against international groups and their staff."</p>
            <p>Turk said that punishing ICC staff for doing their job "violates the rule of law and harms justice." He asked the US to remove all sanctions.</p>
            <p>Turk also said, "At the same time, I ask all countries to immediately take steps to protect all those who are being punished. This includes telling businesses in their areas not to follow these sanctions."</p>
            <p>"Countries need to stand up and protect the organizations they created to protect human rights and the rule of law. People who work to record, investigate, and charge serious violations of international law should not have to work in fear."</p>

            <p>Oil prices went up by almost one dollar per barrel today. This happened because Russia and Ukraine accused each other of slowing down the peace talks. Also, the United States, which uses the most oil in the world, reported strong demand earlier.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Brent crude oil futures went up by 83 cents, which is 1.2%. They closed at $67.67 per barrel, the highest in two weeks.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures went up by 81 cents, which is 1.3%. They closed at $63.52 per barrel.</p>
