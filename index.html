New reports suggest that many young people, often called Gen Z, are becoming less interested in social media. This generation, which grew up with the internet and smartphones, is now looking for more real-life experiences and face-to-face meetings instead of spending hours online. They are tired of the pressure to show a perfect life online and the constant need for digital connection.

Instead of scrolling through feeds, these young adults are increasingly choosing to spend time with friends in person, explore hobbies, and focus on their mental well-being. This shift shows a growing desire for authentic connections and a healthier balance between their digital and physical lives. Experts say this trend might lead to a future where young people use social media more carefully, finding it less central to their daily routines.

**AI Expected to Change Many Jobs, Especially in Wealthy Countries**

According to a report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Artificial Intelligence (AI) is likely to affect almost 60% of jobs in developed, wealthy countries. The report explains that AI, especially "generative AI" which can create text, images, or code, will change the job market in different ways.

For some jobs, AI might replace tasks that people currently do, meaning fewer human workers are needed. However, for many other jobs, AI will work *with* people, making them more productive and efficient. This could lead to higher earnings and new opportunities. The IMF suggests that governments should help workers learn new skills to adapt to these changes and make sure the benefits of AI are shared fairly. This technological shift will require people to be flexible and learn new ways of working alongside AI.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers to Manage Tourism**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started charging a small fee for day visitors to enter the city. This new rule, which began in April 2024, is an effort to control the very large number of tourists who visit Venice for just one day. The city is known for its delicate old buildings and unique waterways, and a huge influx of visitors has caused problems like overcrowding and damage to its historic sites.

The fee is â‚¬5 and is required for visitors who do not stay overnight in a hotel or guesthouse. The goal is to reduce the number of people visiting on peak days and encourage more responsible tourism. Venice is one of the first major cities to introduce such a system to manage "overtourism," a growing issue where too many tourists can harm local life and the environment.
