            <h1>"Shovel Superheroes" from Ukraine and Japan Help in Hualien Disaster Area</h1>
            <p>Hualien's Guangfu disaster area needs help to recover quickly. Recently, many "shovel superheroes" have come to clear mud. There are also foreign helpers, including two Ukrainian women who changed their travel plans to help in Hualien. A Japanese man also excitedly wrote on Facebook, "Guangfu, wait for me!"</p>
            <p>Some time ago, Guangfu Township in Hualien was badly hit by floods when the Mata'an River dam overflowed. Streets were full of mud. Not only volunteers from all over Taiwan came to help, but also international volunteers. Their support from different countries touched many hearts.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government said that among the foreign volunteers were two young Ukrainian women. They have lived in Taiwan for 9 years and usually live in Taoyuan. A month ago, they planned to travel to Hualien. But when they saw the disaster there, they felt very sad and decided to change their plans to help.</p>
            <p>They said that from Hualien train station, they saw many people carrying tools and wearing rain boots, hurrying to the disaster area. Taiwan Railways also added more trains to move rescue workers. This touched them. "Many people from all over Taiwan came here from far away. It's a really big thing. Yesterday, you couldn't even buy rain boots in Hualien because so many people wanted to help."</p>
            <p>Saito Tadataka, a Japanese man living in Taiwan, wrote on Facebook today that he had been thinking hard for three days. Hualien had given him many friends and experiences this year. He wondered what he could do now, but he was also afraid of causing problems if he went to Hualien at this time. Only when he saw many "shovel superheroes" arriving in Guangfu online did he realize he needed to act directly. He decided to become a shovel superhero too and called out, "Guangfu, wait for me!"</p>
            <p>The Facebook page "Migration Lab" also posted today. They said that at this moment, sitting on a full train, they felt "really, really, very, very touched." The train conductor bowed to everyone in each carriage. For some things, you don't even need to say a word. "It's better to put on rain boots than to talk a lot. Thank you, those who love Hualien," and "The whole train of shovel superheroes are super cool."</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government thanked all groups for helping Guangfu Township. They reminded people that County Road 193 (from Jianyin Bridge to Guangfu Township) was originally narrow. Because many large machines and rescue supply vehicles are using it at the same time, it is hard for cars to pass each other, and traffic jams are serious. Now, only southbound vehicles can use the road. Northbound vehicles must take Provincial Highway 11. They asked people to follow traffic guides and let rescue workers use the road first. They asked for understanding for any problems this causes.</p>

            <h1>Man's Body Found in Mata'an River Is "Xiao Yi's" Great-Uncle</h1>
            <p>Today is the fifth day after the Mata'an River in Hualien overflowed. People reported finding a man's body under Mizan Bridge, about 30 kilometers from the Guangfu area. Police checked fingerprints. They confirmed it was the great-uncle of "Xiao Yi," a 6-year-old girl saved earlier on Fozu Street.</p>
            <p>Around 9 AM today, people reported finding a man's body on the riverbed near Mizan Bridge. At first, it was thought to be a worker from a farm downstream named Cai. His family went to Ruishui Life Park to identify him.</p>
            <p>After police checked fingerprints, it was confirmed tonight to be Mr. Wang, a 72-year-old man from Fozu Street. On the day of the event, he, his wife, and the 6-year-old girl "Xiao Yi" were all stuck in the mud. Mr. Wang and his wife worked together to lift "Xiao Yi" onto a roof beam, which saved her life. Sadly, Mr. Wang and his wife died.</p>
