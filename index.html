            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai Reaffirms 3 Key Demands in US Tariff Negotiations</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that talks with the United States about tariffs started on May 1st. They have had 5 meetings in person and 10 talks online, but they are not finished yet. He repeated three important things Taiwan wants. First, Taiwan wants fair and equal tax rates on goods. Second, Taiwan wants to get the "Most Favored Nation" (MFN) tax rate, which means equal tariffs should not be added on top of it. Third, Taiwan wants fair treatment concerning Section 232.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai went to the Legislative Yuan today to talk about a special budget. This budget is for making Taiwan stronger in its economy, society, and people's lives.</p>
            <p>About the US tariffs, Premier Cho said the government will follow four main rules for the talks: keeping Taiwan's interests safe, protecting its industries, looking after people's health, and making sure there is enough food. He repeated the three goals: getting fair and equal tariff rates, getting the Most Favored Nation tax rate without extra tariffs, and fair treatment in talks about Section 232. This is to make sure Taiwan's important industries stay strong and competitive.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho explained that changes in US tariffs can affect Taiwan's industries and jobs. It also changes how global trade works, which then affects international situations. This means Taiwan needs to "rebuild its trade plans." He told the Legislative Yuan that this is one of three rebuilding efforts that must start now and both parts of the government need to work on it together. He said the Legislative Yuan's help is also needed to make progress.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said the government has prepared a special budget bill, as required by law. The total spending is NT$550 billion. This money comes from NT$444.4 billion of leftover money from previous years and NT$105.6 billion from borrowing. The budget is for the period from March 12th this year to December 31st, 2027. The special budget includes NT$78 billion for supporting industries, NT$15 billion for stable jobs, NT$307 billion for people's lives, and NT$150 billion for making Taiwan stronger.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that because the US-Taiwan tariff talks are not finished, NT$20 billion has been saved in the special budget for any final results from the talks. He said this NT$20 billion will "only be used if needed" and asked the Legislative Yuan to support it.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho recently told the Legislative Yuan about three rebuilding plans: rebuilding industry layout, rebuilding disaster areas, and rebuilding social trust.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Proposes a 'Taiwan Model' in Tariff Talks; Green Party Lawmakers: Taiwan and US Work Together to Make Money</h1>
            <p>Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun talked about a "Taiwan Model" for putting more money into the United States. This model is different from those used by Japan, South Korea, or the European Union. Chung Chia-pin, a lawmaker from the DPP party, said today that any model can be talked about if it helps both sides. Another DPP lawmaker, Wu Szu-yao, said this is a good thing. She said Taiwan and the United States should work together to make a lot of money and hoped everyone in politics would agree.</p>
            <p>The talks between Taiwan and the US about tariffs are continuing. Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun, who just came back from the 5th meeting in person with the US, said on October 2nd that the "Taiwan Model" helps companies plan their investments in the US. The government helps with financial support. Through "G to G" (government-to-government) cooperation, they will build groups of industries together.</p>
            <p>Lawmaker Chung Chia-pin and others from the DPP party talked to reporters today about this.</p>
            <p>Chung Chia-pin said that the government had a similar idea in the past with the "New Southbound Policy." This can be seen as Taiwan's economic power growing, or as working with local governments and businesses. Both are good. Everyone should know that economic and trade cooperation between countries always means both sides get something good. As long as this is true, any way of working together can be discussed.</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Wu Szu-yao said that this plan can create groups of Taiwan's semiconductor and information technology (IT) industries in the United States. This will make the cooperation between Taiwan and the US even stronger. She said Taiwan will make money with the US, not just give money away.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao thinks the Taiwan Model is a good idea. She said it should be taken seriously and prepared for in a good way. Also, many countries around the world are investing more in the US. Instead of not wanting to do it, Taiwan should become a very important partner. This also matches President Lai Ching-te's plan to build a democratic semiconductor supply chain that is not connected to China.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said that if the Taiwan Model can happen, with governments working together, Taiwan's experience with science parks could be used in the US. This is a good thing, and she asked people and all political parties to support it.</p>

            <h1>US-China Competition Extends to Submarine Cables; Taiwan Becomes a Geopolitical Focus</h1>
            <p>The United States and China are fighting to build and control the internet cables under the sea. These cables carry 99% of all internet traffic around the world. Taiwan has become a very important place because many cables around it have been broken.</p>
            <p>In February this year, a Chinese cargo ship called "Hongtai No. 58" dropped its anchor in the wrong place near Taiwan's southwest coast. It pulled and broke a submarine cable. This stopped internet and phone signals from working correctly.</p>
            <p>The Chinese captain of the ship, whose last name is Wang, was sentenced to 3 years in prison by a court in Tainan. A higher court later upheld this decision. Taiwan's National Security Bureau says that about 7 to 8 cables around Taiwan break each year. Most of these problems are "linked to China." However, China says these are just accidents. No matter the reason, these events have made the already difficult relationship between Taiwan and China even worse.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that it is very hard to protect these undersea cables. The problem is not only in the Taiwan Strait. It is becoming more urgent as the disagreement between the US and China grows. Almost all internet traffic, including AI discussions, military talks, and financial deals worth trillions of dollars every day, relies on these cables. These cables were first built for countries to work together, not for fighting.</p>
            <p>The places where cables come to land and in shallow water are the easiest spots for them to break. The "Hongtai No. 58" event showed how difficult it is to make sure laws are followed in these areas. This is because actions that target cables, often called "grey zone actions," are sometimes made to look like accidents caused by fishing boats. This makes it hard to collect proof and take legal action.</p>
            <p>The PEACE cable, built by China's HMN Technologies, connects Pakistan, East Africa, and Europe. It started working fully in 2024. Another cable, SEA-ME-WE-6 (Southeast Asia â€“ Middle East â€“ Western Europe 6), built by SubCom from the United States, is expected to start working in early 2026.</p>
            <p>Even though both cables go to Europe, their different paths show the strategic plans of the countries supporting them.</p>
            <p>Almost all undersea cables in the world are made and installed by four companies: China's HMN Technologies, America's SubCom, France's Alcatel Submarine Networks, and Japan's Nippon Electric Company.</p>
            <p>In the past, groups of phone companies and other businesses invested in cables together. Some of these groups included both American and Chinese companies. They did this to share costs and profits. But this way of working is now changing.</p>
            <p>Big American technology companies like Meta (which owns Facebook), Google, Microsoft, and Amazon now use more than 70% of the undersea cables. Ten years ago, they used less than 10%.</p>
            <p>These big tech companies are now building their own internet networks instead of using other companies. For example, Meta is building "Project Waterworth," which will be the longest undersea cable in the world, stretching 50,000 kilometers.</p>
            <p>Because of the demand for AI, money spent on cable systems is expected to increase a lot. It will go from $900 million in 2023 to $15.4 billion in 2028.</p>
            <p>Cables have also broken in Europe and near the Red Sea. Europe is using money to develop new technology to fix this. NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) has started using AI and about 50 drones as part of a plan called "Task Force X" to watch for threats in the Baltic Sea. They are also thinking about doing something similar in the North Sea. NATO has also invested in a company that makes robots that can dive underwater and fix damaged cables using 3D printing.</p>
