**University Dorm Manager in Qingdao Possibly Dies from Heatstroke Due to High Temperatures and No Air Conditioning**

Many places in China are experiencing very hot weather. In Qingdao, Shandong province, a dorm manager at Qingdao University likely died from heatstroke. The university said today that they are still investigating the exact reason. A staff member said that the university has already planned to install air conditioners, and work will start in the dorms during the summer break.

On July 6, some people shared online that a dorm manager at Qingdao University was found unconscious in the duty room. The person later died in the hospital. This news became very popular on social media. Many people wrote that the manager's death was "related to the hot weather" and pointed out that "the duty room did not have air conditioning." They wondered if it counted as a work-related death.

Early this morning, Qingdao University released a statement on Weibo. They said that on the morning of July 6, the dorm manager was found to be unwell in the duty room. Emergency workers arrived and confirmed the person had sadly passed away. The police checked and do not think it was a crime. The exact reason for the death is still being investigated. The university said they are working with the authorities and helping the family.

Students have often complained online in recent years that Qingdao University dorms do not have air conditioning, saying the school spends money on events but not on air conditioning. On July 6, Da Feng News reported that staff from Qingdao University's logistics department said that air conditioners will be installed in the dorms this summer, and some work has already started. The university's main duty office also said that many offices have air conditioning, and for the dorms, "we have already made plans, and they will be installed soon."

On July 5, Qingdao weather services said that Qingdao's hot weather was at its worst. Many areas in Qingdao, like Jiaozhou, Laixi, and Pingdu, issued red warnings for high temperatures. Some areas had temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius. Xinhua News Agency reported that since July, many parts of China have had high temperatures, with over 2 million square kilometers having temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius, and many places over 40 degrees Celsius. Some areas in northern Shandong Peninsula were even over 40 degrees Celsius.

**BTS Member Donates 100 Million Yuan, Fans Join In, Autism Foundation Hopes to Invite SUGA to Taiwan**

SUGA, a member of the Korean boy band BTS, gave 5 billion Korean Won (about 107 million New Taiwan Dollars) to start a new center for autism treatment in Korea. Over 100 Taiwanese fans, called A.R.M.Y, also donated money to support the Taiwan Autism Foundation. The foundation hopes to invite SUGA to meet children with autism in Taiwan.

SUGA (Min Yoon-gi) recently finished his military service and announced his donation. He worked with Yonsei University Severance Hospital to create the new autism treatment center. This center will give long-term care and support to people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This is the largest donation from an artist to the Yonsei medical system, and it has encouraged more people to help others.

SUGA's big donation made others want to help. The Taiwan Autism Foundation recently announced that BTS fans in Taiwan also started to donate money to the foundation. They are supporting the "Star Healing Connection â€“ Autism Young Children Transition Alliance Program" for this year.

More than 100 Taiwanese BTS fans have donated over 200,000 New Taiwan Dollars. The foundation said that these kind fans told them, "As fans, our job is to spread our idol's kindness as much as possible." Lin Chu-chin, the chairman of the foundation, said this is more than just money; it is a blessing and support from the fan community.

Lin Chu-chin said that this kind but strong effort to help others shows how society can work together. It proves that music can connect people and that love can become real help for those who need it. The money from A.R.M.Y will help with the "Young Children Transition Program," which helps children with autism move from kindergarten to elementary school.

Lin Chu-chin also explained that for many families, it is very stressful when children with autism go from kindergarten to elementary school. This program uses special teaching methods, helps teachers and parents at the same time, and gives personal support to help children learn better, make it easier for families, and help children "transition smoothly, learn steadily, and go far."

The Taiwan Autism Foundation plans to invite SUGA to meet "star children" (a nice name for children with autism) in Taiwan if BTS has a world tour here. Liu Tseng-jung, the CEO of the Taiwan Autism Foundation, said that this care from the idol and fans is a big encouragement. They will keep their original goal and use every donation to help more star children grow.
