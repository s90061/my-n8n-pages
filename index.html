            <h1>China Limits Rare Earth Exports; EU and G7 Work Together to Respond</h1>
            <p>Brussels, October 14 (Central News Agency) â€“ Maros Sefcovic, who handles trade for the European Union (EU), said today that the EU is working with G7 countries. They are planning how to deal with China's "unfair" limits on rare earth exports.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, China announced new rules last week. These rules control the export of rare earth technology. China makes most of the world's rare earths. These minerals are very important for making magnets needed in cars, electronics, and defense.</p>
            <p>Sefcovic said, "These limits have made some EU companies stop producing. This causes real economic harm. This is not about safety or stopping the spread of weapons. It is directly aimed at businesses that make things for people to use."</p>
            <p>After meeting with EU ministers in Denmark, Sefcovic told the press, "So, we cannot do nothing. We must respond together."</p>
            <p>He also said, "I am talking closely with G7 partners. I am also talking with China to find a solution." He added that he plans to speak with high-level Chinese officials next week.</p>
            <p>After China put limits on rare earths, US President Donald Trump said on October 10 that he would add a 100% extra tax on Chinese goods.</p>
            <p>Lars Lokke Rasmussen, Denmark's Foreign Minister, spoke with Sefcovic at a press conference. He warned, "The growing trade problems between the US and China are bad news. This makes global trade weaker again, and Europe will also be affected."</p>

            <h1>IMF Report: Taiwan's Economic Growth for 2025 Goes Up to 3.7%</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 14 (Central News Agency) â€“ The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced today that Taiwan's expected economic growth rate for 2025 has been raised to 3.7%. Also, the IMF has raised its prediction for the world's economic growth this year. This is because the impact of taxes and money problems were not as bad as expected.</p>
            <p>In its newest "World Economic Outlook" report, the IMF said that Taiwan's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to grow by 3.7% this year. This is more than the 2.9% predicted in April. For 2026, the prediction went down from 2.5% in April to 2.1%.</p>
            <p>The report also predicts that prices for things consumers buy in Taiwan will go up by 1.7% this year. This is a bit lower than the 1.8% predicted in April. For next year, prices are expected to go up by 1.6%, which is the same as the April prediction.</p>
            <p>For unemployment, Taiwan's rate is expected to stay at 3.4% for both this year and next year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the IMF's new report also said that the US recently made trade deals with some big economies. This stopped President Donald Trump's earlier threats of very high taxes from happening. Other countries also did not take many actions against these taxes. Because of this, the IMF has raised its world growth prediction for the second time since April.</p>
            <p>The IMF now expects the world's real GDP to grow by 3.2% in 2025. This is higher than the 3.0% predicted in July and better than the 2.8% predicted in April. The IMF still expects world economic growth to be 3.1% in 2026, which is the same as the July prediction.</p>
            <p>But the IMF also warned that Trump might start the US-China trade war again. This could slow down the world's production a lot.</p>
            <p>Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, said that taxes were lower than expected. Also, the world economy was helped by companies changing their plans quickly, buying goods earlier, and adjusting their supply chains fast. Other good trends included money help from Europe and China, a weaker US dollar, and a lot of investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>Gourinchas said, "Overall, things were not as bad as we feared. But they are worse than we thought a year ago, and not as good as we need them to be."</p>
            <p>Based on the IMF's main prediction, the US economy is still strong. Its growth rate for 2025 is expected to be 2.0%. This is a small increase from the 1.9% predicted in July. For 2026, the US GDP growth is expected to be 2.1%. This is also a little higher than in July but still lower than the 2.8% in 2024.</p>
            <p>The prediction for the Euro area's growth also went up a little, from 1.0% in July to 1.2%. This is mainly because Germany spent more money to help its economy, and Spain continued to show strong growth.</p>
            <p>Japan's growth rate for 2025 is expected to go up a lot to 1.1%. This is higher than the 0.7% predicted in July. For 2026, growth is expected to go down to 0.6%, but this is still 0.1% higher than the July prediction.</p>
            <p>The IMF's prediction for China's growth stayed the same. It expects 4.8% growth in 2025, mostly because exports increased. However, the IMF noted that this might not continue. For 2026, the expected growth rate is 4.2%.</p>
