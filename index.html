            <h1>Minister Kuo Chih-hui Attends Kaohsiung Startup Exhibition: "I will follow the script"</h1>
            <p>The "2025 Meet Greater South Asia New Startup Exhibition" opened today at the Kaohsiung Exhibition Center. The Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, came to Kaohsiung for the event. When he gave his speech, he held his prepared notes and joked, "I will still perform according to the script."</p>
            <p>The fifth "Meet Greater South Asia New Startup" exhibition started today. Mr. Kuo Chih-hui, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, and Mr. Neil H. Gibson, the director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Kaohsiung Branch, were all there. When Minister Kuo gave his speech, he took out his prepared notes and smiled, saying, "I will still perform according to the script." Everyone in the audience clapped loudly.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo Chih-hui stated that the Asia New Startup Exhibition is now a very important event for new companies in Southern Taiwan. He mentioned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has given its full support since the first year. The "Asia New Startup Park" has brought in 13 international business helper organizations. This has led to more than 2.7 billion New Taiwan dollars in investments and business chances.</p>
            <p>Also, to help local companies change and improve, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has connected 15 research and development groups. They are using new Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in traditional factories. This helps small and medium-sized businesses in the area to upgrade their smart manufacturing and create new products faster.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen Chi-mai said that the "Meet Greater South Asia New Startup" exhibition has been held in Kaohsiung for five years in a row. It gets bigger each year. This year, 260 groups are showing their work, and 31 of these are from other countries. This year, there are also nine new big company plans to hire people. Kaohsiung is working hard to make businesses more digital. It provides places and help for new startup companies to connect and grow. He also thanked "Digital Age" for working with the city government to create the best stage for new companies.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen added that many large international companies, such as TSMC (for its 2nm factory), NVIDIA, and Cisco, have recently come to Kaohsiung. Pier 2 will become one of the research and development centers for the "Smart Kaohsiung Lighthouse Project." The Banana Pier, which was once used for shipping bananas, will be finished being rebuilt by the end of this year and will become an AI research base.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ho Fei-peng, the honorary publisher of "Digital Age," said in his speech that he was excited to run in the Asia Bay area this morning. He noted that Kaohsiung has truly changed a lot in recent years. Kaohsiung shows two beautiful examples of technology. The first is "national guardian" companies like TSMC and NVIDIA, which are famous around the world. The second is the 300 promising new startup teams at the exhibition.</p>
            <p>Today, the Liberty Times newspaper reported that Mr. Chang Tun-han, who is currently the Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidential Office, will become the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. His job will be to coordinate between the government and different political parties. The current Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Kung Ming-hsin, who is good with money matters, will become the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

            <h1>Penghu to Reduce Water Leakage: Pipes to be Replaced and Checked with Technology</h1>
            <p>In Penghu, more than 10% of the daily water supply is lost because of leaks. Today, at a public meeting about the "Reducing Water Leakage Rate" plan, the Taiwan Water Corporation announced their two-part solution. They will replace pipes in areas where many leaks occur. They will also hire outside companies to use technology to find leaks. This plan aims to reduce broken pipes and water shutdowns, making sure people have a steady supply of water.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Mr. Lee Chia-jung, the chairman of Taiwan Water Corporation, visited Mr. Chen Kuang-fu, the Penghu County Magistrate, and his team. They discussed how to protect water resources for the future and how to provide water to people. Today, a public meeting for the "Reducing Water Leakage Rate" plan was held at the Penghu Youth Activity Center. Mr. Tsai Bo-yuan, who is in charge of preventing water leaks at the Water Corporation, explained the plan and how it will be carried out to government officials and business people.</p>
            <p>Magistrate Chen Kuang-fu thanked the Water Corporation for their long-term help in supplying water to Penghu and building its water systems. He also supported the "Reducing Water Leakage Rate" plan. He explained that about 60% of Penghu's water comes from turning seawater into drinking water. Besides building more seawater treatment plants, it is also very important to replace old pipes and reduce water leaks. He asked everyone to support this plan and to save water together.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai Bo-yuan explained that the amount of rain in Penghu changes throughout the year, and more people need more water. This is especially true in the main Magong area. However, the amount of water lost from leaks in the daily water supply is very high, at 12% to 13%. This is a big problem. From 2019 to 2024, the Water Corporation spent over 700 million New Taiwan dollars. They finished the first part of replacing pipes and looking for leaks. They replaced 102 kilometers of pipes, and 83 kilometers of these were in the Magong area.</p>
            <p>He also stated that to use water more effectively, the Water Corporation will start a new "Reducing Water Leakage Rate" plan this year, which will continue until 2032. They will spend 2.7 billion New Taiwan dollars. They will replace 50 to 100 kilometers of pipes in areas with many leaks. At the same time, they will use AI technology from private companies to help check for leaks. They hope this will greatly reduce broken pipes and water being turned off. Their goal is to provide a more stable and better daily water supply for Penghu.</p>
