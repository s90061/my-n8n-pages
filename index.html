            <h1>Chinese Electric Car Company Li Auto Sets Up Overseas Headquarters in Hong Kong</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong's Investment Promotion Agency announced today that Li Auto, a Chinese electric car company, set up its overseas main office in Hong Kong earlier this year. The company plans to grow its business in Hong Kong, hire more local staff, and plan its global expansion.</p>
            <p>The agency said that Li Auto's main reason for opening an overseas office in Hong Kong was to manage global plans for research and development, intellectual property, international supply chains, and to grow business outside China.</p>
            <p>Ms. Li Shu-ching, an assistant director at the Investment Promotion Agency, said that Li Auto is a leading company in China's new energy car industry. Its presence will greatly help Hong Kong's technology and innovation, especially in artificial intelligence (AI) and the new energy car industry.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wang Tian-qi, Li Auto's financial compliance director, said that Hong Kong is an important global financial center and a place for new technology. This can help Li Auto achieve bigger successes worldwide.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wang also said that Li Auto's Hong Kong overseas office will have several key roles. It will be a center for international investment and money management, a place for managing global intellectual property and sharing technical standards, a hub for global research and development, a base for hiring and training international talent, and a center for coordinating international supply chains. It will act as an important link between the Chinese mainland and global markets.</p>
            <p>Li Auto was started in 2015. So far, it has delivered over 1.43 million cars.</p>
            <p>In the last two years, Chinese electric car companies have worked hard to grow in the Hong Kong market and have done very well. They have changed the situation where Tesla was the only big electric car brand. Currently, Chinese electric car brands in Hong Kong include BYD, Maxus (SAIC Maxus), Zeekr (Geely Holding), MG (SAIC Group), Aion (GAC Group), and XPeng.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that in September, among the top 10 electric car brands in Hong Kong, six were Chinese. BYD was number one, Tesla was second, and Zeekr was third.</p>

            <h1>Influencer's Car Shot 12 Times; Chiayi Prosecutors Charge 2 Accomplices, Seek Main Shooter</h1>
            <p>In July, a famous internet personality, Wu Hong-yi, known as "Pineapple," was driving his car with his wife in Chiayi City. A man named Hsieh shot the car 12 times with a gun. Luckily, no one was hurt. Chiayi prosecutors have finished their investigation. Mr. Hsieh, who fired the gun, and Mr. Chen, who is believed to be the mastermind, are still at large and wanted by the police. Mr. Lin and Mr. Chang, who helped the shooter, have been charged with trying to help commit murder and other crimes.</p>
            <p>According to the indictment from the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office on October 14, Mr. Hsieh and Mr. Chen planned together to shoot Wu Hong-yi. On July 15, at 8:05 PM, Mr. Hsieh rode a motorcycle and followed Wu Hong-yi's car to Section 2, Bo'ai Road, Chiayi City. When the car stopped at a red light, Mr. Hsieh used a non-standard handgun to shoot the back right side of Wu Hong-yi's car 12 times. Fortunately, Wu Hong-yi and his wife inside the car were not hurt.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi prosecutors stated that after shooting, Mr. Hsieh rode his motorcycle to a roadside near Wenhua Road Park in Chiayi City, where he left the motorcycle and his helmet. He then took a taxi south to Tianliao District, Kaohsiung City. There, Mr. Lin, 36, drove Mr. Hsieh to hide at his home in Tianliao District. After this, Mr. Lin removed the car's driving recorder to destroy evidence and gave Mr. Hsieh a mobile phone and NT$30,000 for his escape.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi prosecutors explained that on the afternoon of July 16, Mr. Lin drove Mr. Hsieh north to Baihe District, Tainan. There, Mr. Chang, 36, who lives in Tainan City, picked them up. Mr. Chang then drove Mr. Hsieh to Mr. Chen's home in Baihe District to hide. Mr. Hsieh's last known location was in Sinying District, Tainan City, where he disappeared on July 17.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi prosecutors said that Mr. Lin and Mr. Chang were arrested by the police in mid and late July, respectively. Mr. Chen, who is thought to be the mastermind, left Taiwan from Songshan Airport on July 20. On July 16 and 17, Mr. Chen had told Mr. Chang to pick up and hide Mr. Hsieh.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi prosecutors stated that Mr. Hsieh shooting the car 12 times could have caused the death of Wu Hong-yi and his wife. His actions objectively reached the stage of trying to commit murder. Therefore, Mr. Hsieh had an unclear intention to kill when he shot the car. Mr. Lin and Mr. Chang, who helped him escape and hide, have been charged with attempted murder and hiding a criminal.</p>

            <h1>NCKU "Low-Carbon Digital Construction Alliance" Established, Moving Towards Sustainable Net-Zero</h1>
            <p>Digital change is happening now in industries. Artificial intelligence (AI) and reaching "net-zero carbon emissions" are two big challenges for governments and companies. These are important for Taiwan to be competitive in the future. The Central News Agency team is reporting on how the government and different businesses use AI to make production better and create green new ideas. This shows Taiwan's industry is growing again.</p>
            <p>National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) announced today that it has started the "Low-Carbon Digital Construction Alliance." This group is a non-profit platform for working together with companies and academics. It aims to promote low-carbon building materials, green construction methods, and digital building technologies. This will help companies achieve sustainable development and net-zero goals.</p>
            <p>NCKU shared in a press release today that the "Low-Carbon Digital Construction Alliance" (LCDCA) received funding from the National Science and Technology Council. Professor Yang Shih-hsien from NCKU's Civil Engineering Department and Professor Yang Shih-hung from the Architecture Department worked together to start it.</p>
            <p>NCKU explained that to reach the global goal of net-zero emissions, a key part of reducing carbon in civil engineering and construction is to create trustworthy standards for how much carbon is produced in projects. The LCDCA will not only combine different technologies but also be an active platform for working across different fields and improving the way value is created.</p>
            <p>The LCDCA will bring together research, industry, and government policies. It will create standards and labels for low-carbon materials and methods. This will help all parts of the industry work together to create value and make Taiwan stronger in sustainable construction globally.</p>
            <p>NCKU explained that the main way the alliance works is by using and certifying Green-BIM Objects (green Building Information Modeling components). They will build a "low-carbon digital twin" database. This database will help make good decisions for reducing carbon at every stage, from planning and design to construction, operation, and maintenance.</p>
            <p>The alliance offers many services. These include certifying Green-BIM components, helping companies check their carbon footprint (ISO 14064-1) and product carbon footprint (ISO 14067), introducing energy management systems (ISO 50001), evaluating and improving carbon in engineering designs, checking carbon during construction, and developing BIM component models for design, construction, and use. It also helps with writing government grant applications, transferring technology, and connecting academic and industry partners. This helps companies manage their business in a sustainable way and be more competitive in the market.</p>
