            <h1>President Hopes for Pay Raises for Nurses and Medical Staff</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te said today that this year's total budget for National Health Insurance is 928.6 billion New Taiwan dollars. He hopes that as the value of health insurance points increases, hospitals and clinics will properly raise the salaries of nurses and other medical staff. This will help improve the whole medical system and solve the problem of not having enough workers.</p>
            <p>The President spoke at an event for the Taipei Medical Association's new office and 80th anniversary. He said that about ten years ago, five main medical fields had too few doctors. But now, the situation has improved. For example, about 90% of internal medicine training spots are filled. For gynecology and surgery, it's about 96%. For pediatrics, it's about 80%, and for emergency medicine, it's about 86% or even 90%.</p>
            <p>The President remembered that when he was a lawmaker, he helped change laws to make sure doctors would not be unfairly blamed when serving people if they made no mistakes. He also mentioned that former Minister of Health and Welfare, Chiu Tai-yuan, helped make criminal punishments for medical staff more fair. In 2022, a law about preventing medical accidents and solving disagreements was passed. This law makes medical staff feel safer when providing services, which is also better for the public.</p>
            <p>The President stated that the National Health Insurance budget was about 600 billion New Taiwan dollars when he was in the legislature. This year's budget of 928.6 billion is the highest ever. He explained that this money is not just for doctors' pockets but to make the entire medical environment better. This will give medical staff more space to serve people, and people will get better quality medical care. This is the main goal.</p>
            <p>The government now helps pay for nurses' night shifts. Recently, public hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and radiographers, received a pay raise of about 7% to 11%. Because of this, the President hopes that as the point value increases, medical institutions, whether hospitals or clinics, can appropriately raise the salaries of nurses and other staff. This is how the problem of too few medical workers can be solved.</p>
            <p>The President also said that the efforts of the past few years have shown good results, but they are not enough. He will push for a "Healthy Taiwan Deep Cultivation Plan." This plan will spend almost 50 billion New Taiwan dollars over five years, focusing on four areas: making medical work conditions better, training different kinds of medical professionals, developing smart medical technology, and fulfilling social duties.</p>
            <p>The President said, "Once a doctor, always a doctor." He served people directly as a doctor, just like others. After entering politics, as a lawmaker, mayor, premier, or now as president, he always wants to improve the medical environment. He hopes to use everyone's skills to help patients and serve the public. This is his ambition.</p>

            <h1>Worker Dies at TSMC After Accident with Cooling Tower Fan</h1>
            <p>A 50-year-old man, who worked for an outside company, died at TSMC's 18B factory in the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP) in Tainan. On September 11, the man, named Huang, was cleaning a cooling tower when a fan hit him. He then fell into the tower. He was taken to the hospital but did not survive. The STSP Administration has stopped work at that site. The Tainan District Prosecutor's Office finished their examination of the body yesterday.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Fire Department received a call around noon on September 11. They were told that Huang, a worker for an outside company, had fallen while working on a cooling tower at TSMC's 18B factory. When emergency workers arrived, Huang had no signs of life. He was taken to National Cheng Kung University Hospital but died. The STSP Administration sent people to check the site right away and ordered work to stop.</p>
            <p>The STSP Administration found out that Huang was doing yearly maintenance on the cooling tower. He was hit by the tower's fan and fell about 3 meters to the bottom of the tower. The Tainan District Prosecutor's Office examined the body yesterday. They believe the cause of death was severe blood and air in the chest, and shock from losing too much blood. Huang's family agreed with this finding.</p>
            <p>The STSP Administration said today that they will look into the exact cause of the accident and who is responsible. They will do this according to the rules of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. They will also continue to follow the situation.</p>

            <p>Erika stated that Charlie Kirk was killed because "he shared messages of love for his country, faith, and God's kindness." She said, "The bad people who killed my husband had no idea what they did." She added, "You thought my husband's mission was important before, but you really don't know how big of a storm you have just started across the country and the whole world."</p>
            <p>Also, Erika thanked the police and everyone who helped find the person who did it. She also thanked President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance. She said, "Mr. President, my husband loved you very much, and he knew you felt the same way about him." She added, "Your friendship was wonderful."</p>
