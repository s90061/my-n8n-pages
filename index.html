            <h1>Huang Hsiao-wen Easily Beats 20-Year-Old Japanese Boxer, Moves to Last 16 in WB Boxing World Championships</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's female boxer, Huang Hsiao-wen, easily won her match today in the 54kg category at the WB World Boxing Championships. She faced a 20-year-old Japanese boxer, Kokubu Suzushige, in the round of 32. Huang Hsiao-wen showed her advantage in arm length and experience, winning 5-0 and moving on to the round of 16.</p>
            <p>Huang Hsiao-wen, who just turned 28 on August 31, had her first match in the World Boxing (WB) Championships today in Liverpool, UK. She was up against new Japanese boxer Kokubu Suzushige.</p>
            <p>Huang Hsiao-wen is 175 cm tall, which is about half a head taller than her opponent. Her long arms also gave her a big advantage. From the start of the first round, she used quick steps and left punches to break through her opponent's defense. She hit her opponent's head many times. Four judges gave Huang Hsiao-wen 10 points.</p>
            <p>In the second round, Huang Hsiao-wen attacked even more strongly. She used effective combinations of punches, so her opponent could not find a chance to fight back. Huang Hsiao-wen also kept her distance well, not letting her opponent get close. At the end of the second round, all five judges gave Huang Hsiao-wen 10 points.</p>
            <p>The third round was very one-sided. Kokubu Suzushige was clearly tired, which gave Huang Hsiao-wen more chances to attack. In the end, Huang Hsiao-wen won the match 5-0 without any doubt.</p>
            <p>Her coach, Liu Zong-tai, said that Huang Hsiao-wen played very bravely in this match. Her punches were well-timed, and she did not hesitate. Also, she had more experience than her opponent, so she was in control of the whole match.</p>
            <p>After moving to the round of 16, Huang Hsiao-wen will face Mongolian boxer Yesugen Oyuntsetseg. They fought before in the WB Year-End Championship final last year. Huang Hsiao-wen won that match 4-1 and took home the gold medal.</p>
            <p>Also, another Taiwanese boxer, Lai Chu-en, unfortunately lost his first match in the men's 60kg category today. He was defeated 0-5 by Junmilardo Ogayre from the Philippines and was eliminated.</p>

            <h1>Trump Sends National Guard; Washington D.C. Asks Federal Court to Stop It</h1>
            <p>The government of U.S. President Trump sent the National Guard to the capital city, Washington D.C. Today, Washington D.C. asked a federal court to stop this. This action might make the relationship worse between the Republican president and the Democratic leader of the district.</p>
            <p>Washington D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit. He asked a federal court to stop the Trump government from sending the National Guard to Washington D.C. He said it goes against the Constitution and several federal laws.</p>
            <p>This week, a federal judge in California said that sending the National Guard to fight crime was against the law. This lawsuit in Washington D.C. might be another legal problem for Trump's plan to make the military's role bigger in the country.</p>
            <p>Schwalb said on social media, "Armed soldiers should not be enforcing laws on citizens in the United States." He also said that using the military to take over Washington D.C. goes against local self-government and basic freedoms, and it must stop.</p>
            <p>Last month, Trump sent the National Guard to Washington D.C. He said this was to "bring back law, order, and public safety." He also put the district's police department under direct federal control.</p>
            <p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that the President has the legal right to send troops to protect federal property and help with law enforcement.</p>
            <p>Jackson said in a statement, "This lawsuit is just another attempt to stop the President's efforts to fight violent crime in Washington D.C., which hurts the people who live and visit there."</p>
            <p>The lawsuit from Washington D.C. says that sending the National Guard to keep order on the streets without permission from Mayor Muriel Bowser goes against the "Home Rule Act." This law set up self-government for the capital.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit also says that the National Guard sent to Washington is under the "Posse Comitatus Act." This federal law places strict limits on the military's power to enforce laws inside the country.</p>
            <p>In June, Trump put the California National Guard under federal control. He sent them to Los Angeles even though California Governor Gavin Newsom did not agree.</p>
            <p>On September 2, a federal judge in California said that using the military to protect federal agents doing immigration and drug tasks was against the law.</p>

            <h1>Mexico Supports Local Businesses, Considers More Taxes on Countries Without Trade Deals</h1>
            <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said today that the Mexican government is thinking about adding more taxes on imports from countries that do not have trade agreements with Mexico. This includes China.</p>
            <p>These new taxes would be part of the "Plan Mexico." This plan aims to help Mexico's own industries. This is happening while U.S. President Donald Trump has put extra taxes on some products that Mexico sends to the U.S.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum said in a press conference today, "We are thinking about putting special taxes on some goods." She added that these taxes would apply to countries that do not have trade deals with Mexico, including China.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum did not say which products or industries might be affected.</p>
            <p>Mexico is the second-largest economy in Latin America. It is a member of the "United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement" (USMCA). This agreement was made during Trump's first time as U.S. president and replaced the "North American Free Trade Agreement" (NAFTA) in 2020.</p>
