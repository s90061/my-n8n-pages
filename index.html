Taiwan's central bank has warned that the United States' rapidly increasing national debt could affect global trust in U.S. Treasury bonds. This concern was highlighted in a report by the central bank, noting that while the U.S. dollar and Treasuries remain important for global finance, the continued accumulation of debt could pose risks. Taiwan, holding over 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasuries, is closely watching these developments. The central bank emphasized that this situation raises questions about the debt's long-term sustainability and its potential impact on international financial markets.

**Chinese Tugboat "United Hai Gong 5001" Circles Taiwan, Coast Guard Monitors and Warns**

During China's "joint combat readiness patrols," the Chinese tugboat "United Hai Gong 5001" circled Taiwan from June 18th to 22nd. Its purpose was unclear, leading to questions from various parties. The Coast Guard Administration stated that its radars continuously monitored the vessel, and Coast Guard ships broadcast warnings to drive it away. No illegal intentions were found. According to Taiwan ADIZ, the vessel departed from China's Jiulong River area on June 18th, then sailed around the Penghu sea area to southern Taiwan, and then around the waters east of Hualien, reaching Taiwan.

**Online Shoppers Beware: Taiwan's EZ Way App Restricts Overseas IP Connections**

Taiwan's Ministry of Finance Customs Administration has introduced a new rule for the "EZ Way" real-name authentication app, effective June 20th. This change aims to stop fraudulent declarations and suspicious packages. From now on, the app will no longer allow connections from overseas IP addresses for real-name registration or customs declaration authorizations. This means that individuals trying to use the EZ Way app while outside of Taiwan will be unable to complete these essential steps for receiving international packages. Experts are offering advice on how online shoppers can work around these new restrictions to ensure their packages clear customs.
