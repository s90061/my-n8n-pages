            <h1>U.S. University Shooting: 1 Hurt, Shooter Dead, CDC Building Hit</h1>
            <p>Police in the U.S. said that a shooter was active near Emory University in Georgia today. After police responded to reports, the shooter died, and one police officer was hurt during the event. The CDC building next to the university was hit by bullets.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the shooting near the university happened close to the entrance of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some CDC workers said that several bullets hit the windows of the CDC building.</p>
            <p>Emory University in Atlanta announced on X that the 'shelter-in-place' order was lifted. But they still told people to stay away from that area.</p>
            <p>Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said, "We are shocked by the news from Emory University. We pray for the safety of everyone in the university community."</p>
            <p>A deli near Emory University locked its doors and stayed inside because of the event. The manager of the deli, Brandy Giraldo, said that the workers inside heard many gunshots.</p>
            <p>She said, "It sounded like fireworks going off, one after another."</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Willow's Chance of Hitting Taiwan Decreases, Might Disappear</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow was first expected to pass through the Bashi Channel, but weather expert Wu Der-rong said today that European models now show it will pass over the sea north of Taiwan on August 13th and 14th. Because it will move into an area with strong vertical wind shear, it might get weaker or even disappear before reaching Taiwan. The chance of it hitting Taiwan has dropped to 20% to 30%.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Administration (CWA) website, at 2 AM, the center of Tropical Storm Willow was 2280 kilometers east of Taipei. It is moving northwest and then west at a speed of 13 to 19 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column that the newest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model shows the average path of Typhoon Willow has changed. It is now expected to pass over the sea north of Taiwan on August 13th and 14th. However, individual paths shown by the model are quite spread out on both sides. The model also shows that more of its parts predict the typhoon will get weaker or even disappear because it will enter an area with strong vertical wind shear.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the latest European model's 'typhoon circle impact probability map' shows the chance of Willow hitting Taiwan has slightly decreased to 20% to 30%. Since the latest models from different countries are still changing, there are still unknowns about whether Willow will hit Taiwan directly. It is important to watch this closely.</p>
            <p>The CWA has issued a heat warning. Today, Taipei City, New Taipei City, Tainan City, and Pingtung County are under an 'orange light' warning. This means there is a chance of temperatures reaching 36 degrees Celsius or higher for several days. Keelung City and Hualien County are under a 'yellow light' warning, meaning temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius are possible.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the European model shows the Pacific high-pressure system will affect Taiwan today. This means it will be sunny and very hot everywhere, with strong UV rays. People should protect themselves from the sun and avoid heatstroke. There is a small chance of local short rains in the mountains in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>For temperatures, Wu Der-rong said the north is expected to be 23 to 38 degrees Celsius, the central region 24 to 36 degrees, the south 25 to 37 degrees, and the east 23 to 36 degrees.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also said that from tomorrow until August 12th, it will still be sunny and hot everywhere. People should continue to protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. Moisture from the south will slightly increase, making the atmosphere less stable. There is a chance of local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains in the afternoon, which might spread to some flat areas.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong mentioned that from August 13th to 15th, there will be more moisture. However, the weather conditions across Taiwan will depend on the strength and path of Typhoon Willow, so it needs to be watched closely.</p>

            <h1>Financial Times: US Allows NVIDIA to Sell H20 Chips to China</h1>
            <p>The Financial Times reported today that after Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA (a big AI chip company), met with President Trump at the White House, the U.S. Department of Commerce started giving NVIDIA licenses to sell H20 chips to China.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times quoted U.S. officials saying that the Bureau of Industry and Security, which checks export rules, has started to issue licenses for H20 chips.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA designed the H20 chip specifically for the Chinese market to follow the AI chip export rules from former U.S. President Biden's time.</p>
            <p>Last month, the U.S. removed the ban from April that stopped NVIDIA from selling H20 chips to China.</p>
            <p>In July, NVIDIA said it was asking the U.S. government to let it sell H20 graphics processors to China again. The U.S. had promised that NVIDIA would get a license soon.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times reported that after Jensen Huang visited the White House and talked directly to Trump, Trump removed the restrictions from April. But the Trump government was slow to give the license after making the decision, which made NVIDIA unhappy.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times quoted people who know about the matter saying that Huang visited the White House again to meet Trump on August 6th. Two days later, the Department of Commerce started to issue the licenses.</p>
            <p>After China raised worries about possible security risks with NVIDIA's H20 AI chips, NVIDIA said last month that its products do not have 'backdoors' for remote access or control.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for NVIDIA did not want to comment. The U.S. Department of Commerce has not yet replied to Reuters' request for comment.</p>
