The Wikimedia Foundation in the Czech Republic has a program called "Seniors Write Wikipedia." It asks older people to write articles for Wikipedia. This helps them feel important after they retire. It also helps share knowledge between different generations. Recently, students from Taiwan visited the Czech Republic to see how this program works. They want to use these ideas to create new good things for society in Taiwan.

A teacher from Tainan University of Technology, Ms. Cheng Tu-Yuan, said that this program helps seniors feel like they have a purpose again. The students learned how society can benefit from this program. They are now thinking about how to bring this idea back to Taiwan.

A manager from Wikimedia, Lucie Schubert, said the program helps different age groups work together. It also adds more types of knowledge to Wikipedia. Many retired seniors have a lot of knowledge and free time, which makes them good at editing Wikipedia. These seniors often work from home and write about what they are interested in, like family history, art, or famous places.

The program has been running for over 10 years. About 700 to 800 older people have joined, and about 120 of them still write regularly. One senior, Frantisek Stastny, said that writing for Wikipedia makes his free time meaningful after retirement. Ms. Schubert also hopes that older people in Taiwan will write for Wikipedia to share more information about Taiwan.

**Boat Services and Hot Air Balloon Event Canceled in Taitung Due to Typhoon**

Because of Typhoon Danas, boat services between Taitung and Orchid Island (Lanyu) and Green Island will stop on July 7th. Also, the morning hot air balloon event at the International Hot Air Balloon Festival in Luye Township has been canceled.

The Central Weather Bureau announced a typhoon warning for Danas on July 6th, including Taitung County. Although there was no strong wind in Taitung today, it rained a lot. Areas like Daren Township and Dawu Township had over 360 millimeters of rain by 5 PM. Orchid Island also had heavy rain around noon, causing floods and mudslides on its roads.

Some parts of the South-Link Highway (Tai 9 Line) also had small mudslides. The road was temporarily closed for cleaning. As of 6 PM, traffic was controlled on the southbound lane. About 536 people are stuck on Green Island and 78 on Orchid Island. All hotels have been told to keep their guests safe.

All morning flights from Taitung to Taipei and the islands are also canceled for July 7th. The International Hot Air Balloon Festival, which started yesterday, had its afternoon session and light show canceled. The morning session on July 7th is also canceled because of the rain. The shuttle buses for the event will also stop running.

**Taiwan Women's Basketball Team Wins Against Philippines, Coach Praises Their Resilience**

Taiwan's training team for the Universiade women's basketball competition won their last game at the Jones Cup against the Philippines today. They won 76-57. The team was behind by two points at halftime (30-32). But in the third quarter, Yu Chin-Hua and Wang Yueh-Ti helped them come back and take the lead. The coach, Lin Chi-Wen, said she was proud that the players could win even when they were losing at first.

At the start of the game, the Taiwan team struggled to score from far away, making only 2 out of 15 three-point shots. But in the second half, they started to score more easily from close to the basket. Yu Chin-Hua scored 6 points in the painted area, helping the team catch up. Then, Wang Yueh-Ti made two three-point shots, which helped the team get a bigger lead. In the last quarter, the Philippines team got tired, and their shots did not go in as much. This helped Taiwan win the game.

Coach Lin said the team wanted to win too much at the start, which made them a bit rushed. But she was happy that they did not give up when they were behind. She also said that playing against the Philippines was a good challenge for the team before the Universiade. Wang Yueh-Ti scored the most points for Taiwan with 14, and Yu Chin-Hua scored 12 points and got 8 rebounds. The team will now go to Germany for the Universiade, which starts on July 16th.
