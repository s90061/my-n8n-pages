            <h1>Green Party Criticizes Taichung Mayor for "Biggest Landfill in Taiwan," City Says Landfill Not Full</h1>
            <p>News reports recently said that the Dali landfill is full, causing problems for local people. Today, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spokesperson Cho Kuan-ting stated that Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen has not responded, and her 8 years in office have led to the biggest "trash mountain" in Taiwan. The Taichung Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) replied that the landfill follows environmental rules and is not full. They said that once the incinerators are fixed after their yearly check, the trash can be moved back and burned.</p>
            <p>DPP spokespersons Wu Cheng and Cho Kuan-ting held a press conference this morning. Cho Kuan-ting said that on September 1st, the media reported that the Dali landfill was full. Since then, the DPP Taichung City Council has held more press conferences, but Mayor Lu has not said anything for 7 days.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting explained that before former Taichung Mayor Lin Chia-lung left office, the Dali landfill had only 7,000 tons of trash. In 2019, when Mayor Lu started her first year, this went up to 37,000 tons. Now, it has reached 340,000 tons, which is 40% of all the open-air trash in Taiwan's 22 cities and counties.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting pointed out that back in 2018, during Mayor Lin Chia-lung's time, 1 billion New Taiwan dollars were set aside to improve the Wenshan incinerator. It was planned to be finished by 2021. If Mayor Lu had continued this plan, the trash problem could have been solved easily. However, Mayor Lu stopped the previous plan and said she wanted to use a different method (BOT). This made the project cost go up to 8.5 billion New Taiwan dollars, leaving the biggest "trash mountain" in Taiwan after 8 years.</p>
            <p>Wu Cheng added that audit reports have warned for years that Taichung's incinerators are not able to handle enough trash, and the landfills are also not big enough. All three incinerators in Taichung are old and need to be updated. But because Mayor Lu kept changing her mind between two different plans (ROT and BOT), the Wenshan incinerator project was delayed until this year to find companies to work on it. It is now expected to be finished in 2032.</p>
            <p>In response, the Taichung EPB said that the Dali landfill follows environmental rules and is not full. They use it as a place to temporarily store trash when the incinerators have their yearly check. After the incinerators are fixed, the trash from the landfill can be moved back and burned, meaning "trash goes in and then goes out."</p>
            <p>The EPB also stated that they started moving trash from the Dali landfill back to the incinerators in 2023. Even the Minister of Environment, Peng Chi-ming, visited and said that the trash was being handled well. It was not listed in the national meeting about exposed trash.</p>
            <p>The EPB said that to quickly get rid of household trash, they are replacing old incinerators with new ones to burn more trash. They also temporarily take trash to the landfill. To keep the environment clean around the landfill, they cover the trash with recycled materials from burning or with nets to stop smells and prevent trash from blowing away.</p>

            <p>The Luzhou Police Station in New Taipei said that today around 10 AM, a three-story house being taken down suddenly had its third-floor collapse. Dirt and dust quickly filled the air, and the scaffolding and electric wires fell down.</p>
            <p>The police said that after they heard about it, they sent officers to block off the area to keep everyone safe.
