**Netanyahu Nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize**

The leader of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Netanyahu personally gave Trump the letter about this at the White House.

Netanyahu said that Trump is helping to make peace in many countries and areas. He also mentioned that Israel and the US are working together to find countries that want a better future for Palestinians.

Trump has been nominated for this award many times before by his supporters. He has also said he is not happy that he has never won it. Trump believes he helped solve problems between India and Pakistan, and Serbia and Kosovo. He also wants recognition for helping with peace between Egypt and Ethiopia, and for the "Abraham Accords," which helped Israel and some Arab countries become friends.

During his election campaign, Trump said he could end wars in Ukraine and Gaza quickly. But these wars are still happening more than five months after he became president.

**Children's Play "Luna" Tours Paris Schools, Introduces Taiwan and Makes Kids Think About the World**

A play for children called "Luna" is showing in schools in Paris. This play helps French children learn about Taiwan and think about big world problems. The play has been shown almost 30 times and people like it a lot.

The director of "Luna" is a Taiwanese woman named Yang Yi-lin. She used music, songs, and stories to share ideas. The play is about a small boy and his sister who fly from Paris to Taiwan after three years of the pandemic. On their trip, they meet a special rabbit from the moon.

Yang Yi-lin wants to teach children about Taiwan, for example, that it is a democratic country, just like France. She also tells them that Taiwan makes many important computer chips for phones and cars that people use in France.

The play also talks about serious topics like wars in the world. Even if children don't understand everything right away, the play makes them think and ask questions. This helps them learn and understand things better over time. The Ambassador of Taiwan to France even came to watch the play and invited the children to visit Taiwan someday.
