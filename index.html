            <h1>Lu Chia-hui Wins Gold at MUSE Design Awards for Taiwan Women's Power Night in New York</h1>
            <p>Lu Chia-hui, who is the head of the Egret Cultural and Educational Foundation, was asked by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Foundation for Women's Rights Promotion and Development to plan and present an event. This event was called "Taiwan Gender Equality Week â€“ Night of Women's Power: Celebrating Women's Strength and Progress." It took place this year at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York. For her work, Lu Chia-hui won a gold award at the American MUSE Design Awards.</p>
            <p>On March 12, the Taipei office in New York held a "Taiwanese Women's Power Cultural Night" and a "Taiwanese Women's Power Exhibition." These events were open to the public and supported the theme of the 69th United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW 69).</p>
            <p>Lu Chia-hui is also a piano player. On that day, she gave a multimedia piano performance called "Towards the Sun" and "Butterfly Orchid." She used this performance to show the meaning of peace, love, and hope. With her piano music and light projections, she brought together new technology and art. She also used special Taiwanese flowers and symbols to show the spirit of women, which is about "strong leadership and big changes."</p>
            <p>Lu Chia-hui's designed and organized performance won a gold award in the "Conceptual Design - Exhibition & Events" category at the 2025 MUSE Design Awards. This was announced on August 28th, Eastern US time.</p>
            <p>The theme for Taiwan Gender Equality Week 2025 was "Taiwan's Home Ground." It started with strong, simple colors: red for courage, green for growth, and gold for success. The main symbol was a "butterfly," which stands for Taiwan and the changing journey of women.</p>
            <p>The Egret Foundation said that Lu Chia-hui's multimedia show, "Hope," made the stage come alive. It used new technology to show live piano playing and amazing art visuals of special Taiwanese plants at the same time. This perfectly mixed music, art, technology, and hope. Her two original video works, "Towards the Sun" and "Butterfly Orchid," gave the guests a rich experience for all their senses.</p>

            <h1>People Often Get Caught in Bus Doors; Taipei Public Transportation Office Asks for Standard Procedures to be Followed</h1>
            <p>On August 30, a news report from Taipei said that a passenger on bus 265 got caught in the bus door. The driver only stopped and opened the door after other people told him. A city council member said that people getting caught in bus doors happens too often. Today, the Taipei Public Transportation Office said it would tell bus companies to make sure their drivers follow all standard rules.</p>
            <p>Yu Shu-hui, a city council member from the KMT party, showed information from a question she asked. She said that she received a complaint from a person who was on the last bus 265 recently. The driver might not have seen that a passenger wanted to get off. The driver quickly closed the door and drove away. This caused the passenger to get caught and stuck in the middle of the door. The driver only stopped and opened the door when other passengers told him.</p>
            <p>She added that people have said that bus 265 is often crowded during rush hours when many people go to and from work. Passengers often stand near the front and back doors. Some drivers close the doors before everyone has gotten off completely. This causes sudden stops and people getting caught in the doors to happen often.</p>
            <p>She checked the data and found that bus companies reported 46 cases of passengers being caught in doors in 2023, 25 cases last year, and 13 cases from January to June this year. She believes that the number of times people were caught but not hurt might be very high.</p>
            <p>Yu Shu-hui asked the Public Transportation Office to send a letter to all bus companies. Especially for companies that have many cases of people getting caught on certain routes, they should tell drivers to pay attention before closing doors. Drivers should check if any passengers are getting off. This is to stop similar problems from happening again and to keep citizens and students safe when they ride the bus.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Public Transportation Office said that to make bus rides safer, they hold 12 driving safety training sessions every year. They have also asked bus companies to do their own training.</p>
            <p>The Public Transportation Office said they will continue to ask bus companies to tell their drivers to follow all standard rules. Drivers must really pay attention to passengers inside and outside the bus. They should wait until all passengers have gotten on or off completely. Only then should they close the doors and leave the stop. This will prevent passengers from getting caught in the doors and will make sure bus rides are safe.</p>
            <p>Also, all large buses in the city now have safety devices that stop doors from catching people and warn if a door is not closed well. Starting last year, they also started helping with money to install active door sensor safety systems. To make passengers safer, bus companies have been asked to install these systems faster. They expect 80% of buses to have them installed this year, and all buses to have them by next year.</p>

            <h1>Lu Jian-de Argues with Taipei City over Long-Term Care; Shih Chung-liang Says Policies Need Cooperation</h1>
            <p>On August 30, a news report from Taipei said that Lu Jian-de, the Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare, has argued with the Taipei City government several times recently about numbers related to long-term care. Today, Shih Chung-liang, who will soon be the Minister of Health and Welfare, tried to calm the situation. He said that the central government makes plans and gets money for these plans. Local governments also need to use these resources well. They must work together, and any weak areas will be made stronger.</p>
            <p>In the morning, Shih Chung-liang went to a meeting called "Latest Developments in Oncology 2025." Before the meeting, he spoke to reporters. When asked how to solve disagreements between the central government and local governments in the future, Shih Chung-liang said he praised all city and county governments for working hard to improve long-term care. He said that without their efforts, the number of people getting long-term care would not have kept going up in recent years.</p>
            <p>Shih Chung-liang then changed the topic and pointed out that the central government makes the plans for long-term care and gets the money for it. Then, local governments carry out these plans. This means that for long-term care to be successful, the central government and local governments must work together.</p>
            <p>Shih Chung-liang said that the central government understands what local areas need. It makes good plans and gets enough money. Local governments must also use these resources well. They should spend the money correctly and follow the plans. This way, long-term care can be successful, and any parts that are not strong enough will be improved.</p>
            <p>Recently, Lu Jian-de said that "Taipei City ranks last in providing long-term care services." This caused the Taipei City government to disagree. Yesterday, Lu Jian-de spoke to reporters by phone to explain. He said that the way they count how many people get long-term care services follows a single rule for the whole country. The bottom number (denominator) is the estimated number of people who need long-term care, such as those with dementia or disabilities. The top number (numerator) is the actual number of people who use Long-Term Care 2.0 services.</p>
            <p>Lu Jian-de stressed that this rule is not only the same across the country, which makes sure that all cities and counties are compared fairly and shows how many resources are available and actually used, but it is also a common way to measure things around the world.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Health Department said that every city and county is different in terms of how many people live there, what medical help they have, and their social services. So, the need for long-term care and how much it is used will naturally be different. Taipei City not only works with the central government's Long-Term Care 2.0 plan but also has many other programs. To show the real results of its long-term care services, it uses a "care replacement rate" which residents find most helpful, based on their needs.</p>
