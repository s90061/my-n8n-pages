A weather expert, Wu Derong, said that the weather in Taiwan will not be stable today and tomorrow. There will be rain and thunderstorms, especially in the west. Some storms might be very strong with lightning and strong winds.

People in Central and Southern Taiwan should be ready for several days of heavy rain that could cause problems. The weather office has told 11 cities and counties, like Taichung, to be careful. Some areas in Taitung and Pingtung could even have extremely heavy rain.

After July 11, the weather will be mostly sunny and hot. But there might still be short, strong rain in the afternoons, especially in the mountains. There are no typhoons that will affect Taiwan in the next 8 days, but people should keep an eye on new weather changes later.

**US Disasters: Warnings Not Followed, Says Newspaper**

The Los Angeles Times newspaper wrote about two big weather problems in the United States this year: wildfires in Los Angeles and floods in Texas. The newspaper said that warnings were given early, but local governments did not act quickly. This caused many people to die and a lot of damage.

The weather office, NWS, had said days before that the weather could be very dangerous. For example, before the fires in Los Angeles, they warned about very strong winds. Before the floods in Texas, they warned about heavy rain.

Sadly, 30 people died in the LA fires, and 15,000 buildings were burned. In Texas, over 100 people died, including 27 young children at a camp. The newspaper said that warnings are important, but governments must do more to help people before disasters happen, especially with more extreme weather now.

**US Troops in Taiwan: Experts Discuss Their Role**

There is a discussion in Washington about the 500 US military people who are in Taiwan to help with training. A new report says these troops should leave Taiwan, because it might make China angry. It also says that having troops there goes against old promises.

However, another expert, Michael Sobolik, does not agree. He says that the US has never promised to take all its soldiers out of Taiwan without conditions. He points to the Taiwan Relations Act, a law that says the US should give Taiwan weapons and help it defend itself. This help is based on what Taiwan needs.

The report that suggests removing the troops also says that US military training programs are not always helpful. But Sobolik believes the law is clear: the US must help Taiwan protect itself. This discussion shows different ideas on how the US should support Taiwan.
