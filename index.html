            <h1>ASE Plans to Demolish and Rebuild Sumibe Factory to Expand Advanced Semiconductor Packaging</h1>
            <p>ASE Technology Holding, a company that packages and tests semiconductors, announced today that its part of the company, ASE Semiconductor, has decided to tear down the old Sumibe Technology factory building. They will rebuild the K18B factory. The building work will be given to a related company, Fuhwa Engineering. This is to make more space for advanced packaging in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Don Hung-ssu, the Chief Financial Officer of ASE Technology Holding, explained in a press conference this afternoon. He said that the company bought all of Sumibe Technology's shares in the first half of this year. They did this to easily combine the companies and get the land for the factory. This helps the Kaohsiung factory grow its business in the future. Today, they decided to tear down and rebuild the factory buildings on that land.</p>
            <p>Mr. Don Hung-ssu also said that ASE Semiconductor plans to build a new factory with 2 underground floors and 8 above-ground floors. The total size of all floors will be about 18,341.93 ping (a Taiwanese unit of area). ASE Semiconductor looked at four companies that wanted to do the construction work and could do it. They chose based on things like skill, building experience, time to finish, quality of work, and how well they would work on the project. They decided to give the K18B factory building project to Fuhwa Company. Both sides agreed on a price of NT$4.008 billion, not including tax.</p>
            <p>In mid-March, ASE Semiconductor announced that it had bought all of Sumibe Technology's shares. Sumitomo Chemical, a Japanese company, owned Sumibe Technology. The main reason for this investment was to get the right to use the land in Kaohsiung's Nanzih Park for building a factory.</p>
            <p>ASE Semiconductor is actively making more space for advanced packaging. In mid-August, they also announced plans to buy a factory and other buildings from Win Semiconductors. These are located in Luzhu District, Kaohsiung City, in the Lujhu Science Park.</p>
            <p>ASE Technology Holding is working hard to set up advanced packaging in Kaohsiung. They have already invested 200 million US dollars. This money is for setting up their first production line for large 600x600 FOPLP (Fan-Out Panel Level Package) technology.</p>
            <p>In October 2024, ASE Semiconductor started building its new K28 factory. This K28 factory is expected to be finished in 2026. Its main purpose is to increase the amount of CoWoS advanced packaging and testing it can do. In August 2024, ASE Semiconductor bought the K18 factory in Kaohsiung's Nanzih from Hung Ching Construction. This was to set up production lines for wafer bumping and flip-chip packaging processes.</p>
            <p>In late December 2023, ASE also announced that it had rented a factory from Formosa Advanced Technologies in Kaohsiung's Nanzih. This was to make more space for packaging. Experts in the industry think this is to increase advanced packaging for Artificial Intelligence (AI) chips.</p>

            <h1>Chiayi County Shopping Festival Starts October 1st for 2 Months, Main Prize is a Camper Van</h1>
            <p>The "Jiashang Haoli" (Good Gifts) Joint Shopping Festival in Chiayi County will start on October 1st and last for two months. More than 1,000 stores will take part. If you spend over NT$200, you can enter a lucky draw. This year's big prizes include a special camper van worth over a million NT dollars and a Jimny off-road car.</p>
            <p>Today, the Chiayi County Government held a press conference to announce that the yearly Joint Shopping Festival will happen from October 1st to November 30th. This year, the big prizes you can win include a special camper van and an off-road car, both worth over a million NT dollars. There are also electric scooters, an iPhone 17, massage sofa chairs, a Google TV smart projector, and more than 290 other prizes.</p>
            <p>County Magistrate Weng Chang-liang spoke to reporters. He said that this is the fourth year for the Joint Shopping Festival. Every year, many people enjoy it. This year, they have made the event longer, hoping to get even more people to join in.</p>
            <p>Mr. Weng also said that last year, the Chiayi County Joint Shopping Festival made over 450 million NT dollars in sales. This year, the event is even bigger. During the festival, if you spend NT$200 or more in one purchase at any of the stores in Chiayi County's 19 business areas or at stores that are part of the Greater Chiayi Tourism Factory Association, you can go online to get a lucky draw number. There is no limit to how many times you can spend money. The more you buy, the better your chances of winning.</p>
            <p>Ms. Li Ya-ping, the head of the Economic Development Department, said that they want to make it easier for people to join the event. So, the way to register will now connect with the Ministry of Finance's electronic invoice system. People can link their cloud invoice account on the registration page. After they buy something, they will automatically get a lucky draw number. For paper invoices or stores that do not give invoices, they have also made the registration steps simpler. This means people can finish registering faster.</p>

            <h1>Chiang Chi-chen Meets US Think Tank, Hopes Taiwan-US Tariff Talks Reach a Good Result</h1>
            <p>A group from a US think tank called the Institute for Indo-Pacific Security (IIPS) visited the Legislative Yuan today. Chiang Chi-chen, the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, said he hopes that talks between Taiwan and the US about tariffs (taxes on goods) will end with a good result for both sides. He also hopes Taiwan can join more discussions about safety in the region and more international groups. This way, the world can hear Taiwan's voice.</p>
            <p>The group from the Institute for Indo-Pacific Security was led by Randall G. Schriver, who used to be an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs in the US. This morning, they met with Chiang Chi-chen and members of parliament from different parties: Chen Kuan-ting from the Democratic Progressive Party, Chen Yung-kang from the Kuomintang, and Chen Chao-tzu from the Taiwan People's Party. When Mr. Schriver spoke, he first said he was sorry for the people who died in the Hualien storm. He also hoped that the rescue work would go well.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen said that the "Project 2049 Institute," which Mr. Schriver led, changed its name to the "Institute for Indo-Pacific Security" on May 1st this year. This shows how important and complex the Indo-Pacific area is becoming. It also shows that they care a lot about safety in this region.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen said that Taiwan and the US have been friends for a long time. This friendship is based on shared values like democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. Both countries also work together to keep the region peaceful, rich, and stable. Recently, the US Congress has passed laws like the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). They have also provided Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and used the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA). These actions help Taiwan build its defense and safety abilities. Taiwan is located on the first island chain in the West Pacific. It knows its important position and understands its duty for safety. In the future, Taiwan will continue to work with the US and other partners in the region to deal with different challenges and dangers.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen pointed out that Taiwan is important not only for its location in world politics but also for its economic role. It plays a key part in the world's supply chains for semiconductors and other industries. In the future, Taiwanese companies like TSMC will become even more important for making computer chips. Other Taiwanese companies will also be more important for putting things together very efficiently. Because of its location and its role in industry, Taiwan is a very important partner that the US needs for its international plans.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen stated that because Taiwan has such an important role, it will continue to be a responsible partner in the region and a responsible global citizen. Taiwan will also show its strong will to defend itself. The government has already announced that next year's defense budget will be more than 3% of its GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The Legislative Yuan's job is to watch over the government. They should also talk and discuss openly, no matter their party, about any spending, plans, or purchases that help Taiwan's defense. This way, they can make the best decisions for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen added that besides safety, the most important thing for Taiwan-US relations right now is the tariff talks. He hopes these talks will end with a win-win result for both sides. The goal is to create a trade relationship that is free, fair, and helpful to both countries.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen said that he hopes Taiwan and the US will have more chances to communicate. He also hopes that Taiwan can be included in more discussions and meetings about regional safety, and join international groups. When Taiwan's voice is heard by the world, and its ideas can be shared with other countries, it will help make the world safer, more peaceful, and more stable.</p>
            <p>Mr. Schriver said he was happy to meet with members of parliament from different parties. He believes that to talk about important issues, it is good to hear different ideas. It is also important for everyone to come together and talk.</p>
            <p>Mr. Schriver shared a famous quote from American basketball coach John Wooden: "Be quick but don't hurry." He said this might sound like a contradiction. Many Americans say that Taiwan's defense budget should be approved quickly because many things are urgent. However, the Legislative Yuan represents the people and watches the government. Even if they want to increase the defense budget, they must make sure the money is used wisely and for the right things.</p>
            <p>Mr. Schriver said that the Institute for Indo-Pacific Security and the American people are happy to offer more help to the Legislative Yuan and the people of Taiwan. This is because the Institute studies how wars change. They also understand what Taiwan needs, not just for chip discussions. He hopes they can continue to talk in the future.</p>
