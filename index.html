            <h1>Football Association's 2023 broadcast fees overspent by 200%; no receipts for equipment purchases signed by players</h1>
            <p>The audit department announced today that the Football Association (FA) overspent on international competition broadcast fees by 200% in 2023. Also, the FA received money for equipment two years in a row, but either fewer people signed for the equipment than expected, or there were no signed receipts from players. The government should check how it approves money given to sports groups more carefully.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's men's football team cannot play in the 2027 Asian Cup. There have been many reports of mistakes made by the Chinese Taipei Football Association. Even the team captain, Chen Po-liang, said, "Taiwanese people are bullying Taiwanese people." This has made many people pay attention.</p>
            <p>The audit department today released reports about how the Ministry of Education's Sports Administration supervises the National Sports Training Center and how it gives money to sports groups. It also looked at questions about how the Sports Administration approved money for the Chinese Taipei Football Association.</p>
            <p>The report first said that the FA used money from the Sports Administration to buy plane tickets and broadcast services. The FA did not have detailed price information for its budget. This made the prices higher than market prices. The cost of plane tickets was also much higher than for other sports groups at the same time. The FA chose a company with a higher price, which means it did not follow fair rules when buying things.</p>
            <p>The report also said that for the same project, money for broadcast fees and marketing was given. The FA did not follow the Government Procurement Act for bidding. Instead, it directly chose one company, or it chose two different companies that seemed to be connected in an unusual way. The audit department has sent this information to the investigation agency and the Control Yuan on March 17 this year.</p>
            <p>In addition, the report pointed out problems with how the Sports Administration checked the money given to the FA. First, the FA's broadcast fees for five projects in 2023, including "2023 International Men's Football Invitational Taiwan vs. Thailand," were much higher than planned. The actual costs were 700,000 to 800,000 NT dollars more than the planned costs. This means the costs were 140% to 200% higher than expected.</p>
            <p>The report used the "2023 International Men's Football Invitational Taiwan vs. Thailand" as an example. The budget for broadcast fees was 500,000 NT dollars. It was planned to broadcast on TV and online during popular times, using 6 cameras and 4K quality, with a commentator and analyst. However, when the money was checked, the broadcast fee increased to 1,200,000 NT dollars.</p>
            <p>The report said that the Sports Administration explained this was because more TV channels broadcasted the event. But the original budget of 500,000 NT dollars did not say how many channels would broadcast. When the money was checked, there was no explanation for the difference in broadcasting. The Sports Administration only accepted the note "more broadcast channels" on the income and expense report and approved all the money. The audit department sent a letter to the Sports Administration on March 12 this year, asking them to improve how they check applications and approvals for money.</p>
            <p>Also, the report said that the National Sports Training Center gave money to the Football Association in 2023 for the "2022 Hangzhou Asian Games and 2024 Paris Olympics" women's football training team. They approved over 760,000 NT dollars for yearly equipment. Out of this, 500,000 NT dollars for clothes (equipment) was calculated for 50 people, with 10,000 NT dollars per person.</p>
            <p>The report stated that the FA bought 454 items in total, including training shirts and pants, warm-up clothes, jackets, backpacks, and football socks. The total cost was 542,080 NT dollars (490,000 from the government, 52,080 from the FA). When the FA completed the financial report, it only provided a sign-off sheet for clothes (equipment) from the "2024 Paris Olympics Qualification First Round" event in Lebanon in March 2023. Only 34 people signed, which is less than the 50 people approved for the money. Also, the sign-off sheet did not list the specific items and amounts received, so it was not clear what equipment was actually given out. However, the National Sports Training Center still approved the money.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in 2024, the National Sports Training Center gave money to the Football Association for the "2026 20th Nagoya Asian Games" women's football training team. They approved over 930,000 NT dollars for yearly equipment. Out of this, 600,000 NT dollars for clothes (equipment) was set aside. 500,000 NT dollars for competition and team uniforms was estimated the same way as in 2023. Another 100,000 NT dollars was for training vests and training clothes for new players and to replace damaged items. The FA bought 50 sets of competition and team uniforms, and 10 sets of training vests and training clothes.</p>
            <p>The report pointed out that when the FA completed the financial report, it only provided an application form signed by the head coach. It did not provide sign-off sheets from the players as required. This made it impossible to know what equipment was actually given out. However, the National Sports Training Center still approved the money.</p>
            <p>The audit department emphasized that the Sports Administration should tell the National Sports Training Center to find out the actual situation of clothes and equipment received by the association. They should also handle things correctly according to the rules.</p>

            <h1>Tamsui Shalun Beach may open for walking on the sand; New Taipei City says safety is most important</h1>
            <p>The study on the sea conditions at Tamsui Shalun Beach in New Taipei City has finished its final report. The report still says that the sea area should not be fully open. However, it suggests that the beach and shallow water area could be opened for people to walk in the water. New Taipei City Deputy Mayor Chu Ti-chih said that if they open it, "safety" must be the most important thing.</p>
            <p>Today, the New Taipei City Council had a meeting to discuss work. Kuomintang council member Chen Wei-chieh asked about opening the Tamsui Shalun Cultural and Creative Park and Shalun Beach. Sheng Hsiao-jung, the director of the Economic Development Department, said that the Cultural and Creative Park is about 91.12% finished. It is now being decorated inside and is expected to be finished on time.</p>
            <p>Yang Tsung-min, the director of the Tourism and Travel Department, said that National Taiwan Ocean University was asked to study the sea conditions at Tamsui Shalun Beach. The final report meeting was yesterday. The land area is quite safe, and the beach might be opened. But a decision can only be made after a water safety meeting at the end of the year. If they decide to open it, they will still need to talk with the Tamsui District Office and other groups about how to manage it.</p>
            <p>Chu Ti-chih said that for both the Cultural and Creative Park and Shalun Beach, if they are opened, "safety" must be the most important thing. But the studies of the sea in all four seasons showed strong currents pulling out to sea, which means there is still some danger.</p>
            <p>Chen Wei-chieh said that Shalun Beach has been closed for many years because it was announced as a dangerous sea area. Local people have different opinions about opening it. If safety cannot be guaranteed, it should not be opened carelessly.</p>
            <p>Cheng Yu-en, a Democratic Progressive Party council member, also posted on Facebook. She said that Shalun is not just Tamsui's coastline, but also a lot of people's youth memories. If it is to be opened safely and with peace of mind in the future, they need to clearly mark safe water areas, have more staff there on weekdays and weekends, and teach people about water safety through activities and education. This way, the beach can truly be a place where citizens can "get close to the sea and play in the water."</p>
            <p>The Tourism and Travel Department said that based on the final report of the sea condition study, they suggest opening the land area of Shalun for activities like horseback riding, sand sliding, and taking wedding photos. They also suggest allowing people to walk and play in the shallow water area near the shore (usually not deeper than the knees). However, because the currents at Shalun Beach are too fast during tides in all four seasons and flow out to sea, and there are rip currents, all water activities have a medium to high risk. Therefore, they suggest not opening the water area for activities.</p>

            <h1>Visually impaired people can also cook steak; Blind Rehabilitation Center offers cooking classes to help them return to life</h1>
            <p>Today is White Cane Safety Day. The Central Service Center of the Taiwan Blind Rehabilitation Center is offering group cooking classes for visually impaired people. The classes teach them how to safely cut vegetables, cook, and clean. This helps them build confidence, live independently, and go back into society.</p>
            <p>The classes were held today in the multi-purpose classroom at the center's Central Service Center. Three teachers who help with daily living skills guided eight visually impaired students. They made different dishes like pan-fried steak, corn chowder, pan-fried zucchini, and French quiche. The students worked together to wash vegetables, cut them, cook, and finally clean up.</p>
            <p>Huang Yu-ting, a teacher who helps with daily living skills, told CNA that some visually impaired people had cooked before they lost their sight. But after losing their sight, they lost those skills. Through the classes, they learn how to use their sense of touch to safely cut vegetables. They start with simple cooking like using an electric pot or microwave. Then, they move on to cooking with an open flame at home. This helps them live on their own.</p>
            <p>"My children love the food I cook," said student Hsu Yun-jung. She did not cook much before she lost her sight. She started trying to cook after she became visually impaired. She often cooks chicken curry rice at home because it is easy and tasty. She feels happy that she can cook for her family.</p>
            <p>Wu Cheng-tsung, the director of the Central Service Center of the Taiwan Blind Rehabilitation Center, said that the center helps visually impaired people in Taichung City. They offer classes for using mobile phones, finding their way around, and cooking. They have both one-on-one lessons for individual needs and group classes. This helps visually impaired people go back into society.</p>
            <p>Talking about the cooking classes, Wu Cheng-tsung explained that visually impaired people often eat out, which can be bad for their health. By cooking their own food, they can choose different ingredients, learn more life skills, and live independently. Also, because it is a group class, students can talk about their cooking experiences and problems they face. They can solve problems together and get used to living.</p>
            <p>Wu Cheng-tsung said that a "white cane" helps visually impaired people move around. He hopes that White Cane Safety Day will make more people pay attention to blind people and work to make their lives better. He also hopes for help from all parts of society and that schools will offer related awareness classes. More information can be found on the Taiwan Blind Rehabilitation Center website.</p>
