Recent reports show that households are spending less money, especially on things they don't really need. This trend is happening because the cost of living remains high, meaning prices for everyday items like food and energy are still expensive. Many people feel that their incomes have not grown as quickly as these rising prices.

Families are choosing to buy fewer non-essential items such as new clothes, restaurant meals, and entertainment. Instead, they are focusing their money on necessities. Experts say that consumer confidence, which is how optimistic people feel about the economy, is still low. This suggests that people are careful with their money because they are worried about their financial future. The current economic situation is making it difficult for many people to manage their daily budgets, leading them to prioritize essential spending over luxury items or leisure activities.

**AI Creates New Jobs Beyond Just Technology**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to a big increase in job opportunities, and not just in the technology sector. Many different industries are now looking for employees who understand AI and how to use it. This means that jobs connected to AI are appearing in fields like healthcare, marketing, and manufacturing, not just in software companies.

The new roles often require human skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and strategic thinking. Companies are realizing that while AI can do many tasks, human workers are still needed to guide AI, interpret its results, and come up with new ideas. Businesses are also investing in training their current employees to work with AI, helping them gain new skills for the changing job market. This shows a growing trend where humans and AI will work together more closely in the future workplace.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers**

The Italian city of Venice has started asking day visitors to pay a small fee to enter. This new rule is part of an effort to manage the very large number of tourists who visit the city, especially those who come for just one day without staying overnight. The city wants to protect its unique historical sites and delicate environment from the damage caused by too many visitors.

The new system requires tourists visiting on selected busy days to book and pay online before they arrive. They receive a special QR code to show as proof of payment. The fee is a way for Venice to encourage more sustainable tourism, meaning tourism that supports the city's long-term health rather than harming it. If visitors do not pay the fee when required, they may face a fine. This initiative hopes to make visits to Venice more enjoyable for everyone and help preserve the city for future generations.
