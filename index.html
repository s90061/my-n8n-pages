A recent study suggests that spending too much time looking at screens, like phones or computers, could be bad for your health and even shorten your life. Researchers looked at information from nearly half a million people aged between 37 and 73 in the UK. They found that adults who spent more than six hours a day looking at screens, without doing much physical activity, had a higher chance of dying early. This risk was especially clear for people who didn't exercise enough. The study showed that being active helps reduce this risk. For example, people who spent a lot of time on screens but also exercised for 30 to 40 minutes each day didn't face the same high risk. Experts say that while it's hard to avoid screens completely in modern life, it's important to balance screen time with regular physical activity to stay healthy. This research highlights the need for people to be more active, even if their jobs or daily routines involve a lot of screen use.

**AI Is Creating New Jobs That Many Didn't Expect**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the job market in surprising ways, not just by replacing old jobs but also by creating many new ones. While some people worry about AI taking over human roles, new data suggests that AI is opening up fresh career paths. For example, there's a growing need for "prompt engineers," who are experts at writing instructions for AI programs to get the best results. Another new role is "AI ethicist," someone who makes sure AI systems are fair and don't cause harm. There are also "AI trainers" who teach AI models how to perform tasks better. These new jobs often require a mix of technical skills and soft skills like creativity and problem-solving. This trend shows that instead of fearing AI, workers can prepare for the future by learning new skills that work alongside AI technology. Companies are looking for people who can help them use AI effectively and responsibly.

**Popular Places Are Trying to Manage Too Many Tourists**

Many popular travel destinations around the world are facing a problem called "overtourism," where too many visitors cause stress on local life, natural beauty, and services. Places like Venice in Italy, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and Kyoto in Japan have seen their streets, public transport, and historical sites become very crowded. This can make life difficult for residents and damage the environment. To deal with this, some cities and countries are now trying new ways to manage tourist numbers. For example, Venice has started charging a small fee for day-trippers. New Zealand is focusing on attracting high-value tourists rather than just high numbers. Japan is encouraging visitors to explore lesser-known areas away from the main tourist spots. These efforts aim to protect local culture and nature, while still allowing people to enjoy these beautiful places. The goal is to create a more balanced and sustainable future for travel, where both tourists and locals can benefit.
