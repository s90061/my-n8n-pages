            <h1>Koizumi Shinjiro Lost Election for LDP Leader Amid Controversies About Fake Comments and Reading from a Script</h1>
            <p>Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Koizumi Shinjiro, lost the final round of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader election today. During his campaign, he faced several problems. First, there was a debate about fake online comments, and then people questioned him for always reading from a script. After the election, he said that the reason for his loss was "my own lack of ability."</p>
            <p>This was Koizumi Shinjiro's second time running for the position. He made it to the final round, avoiding the bad result of losing in the first round last year. However, he only got 156 votes, while Sanae Takaichi received 185 votes. There was a big difference in votes from party members. Takaichi got 119 votes in the first round, and Koizumi was second with only 84 votes.</p>
            <p>At the start of the election, many thought Koizumi Shinjiro would win easily. But soon after the campaign began, news came out that Koizumi's team was involved in a "fake comment" incident, which hurt his campaign a lot.</p>
            <p>The office of ç‰§å³¶KAREN, a member of parliament in charge of campaign promotion, sent emails to supporters. These emails asked them to "write some positive comments on Niconico Douga," which means to "flood" the platform with comments. The emails even gave 24 examples of comments. These included "The real star is finally here" and "His performance is better than last year." The emails also suggested sending comments that might criticize other candidates.</p>
            <p>After this, ç‰§å³¶KAREN left her role in promotion. Koizumi said sorry and stated that he "did not know about it." Even though Koizumi did not leave the election, people thought that this event would likely affect the party members' votes.</p>
            <p>Another problem for Koizumi was that he almost always looked down at a script during press conferences and debates. For example, at a press conference on September 20th, he looked down at his script more than 500 times in one hour, including during questions. This became a topic of discussion. Koizumi explained that he did it "to be careful." He said that "being in a position of responsibility, it is important to be cautious."</p>
            <p>Perhaps because he was too careful, Koizumi was criticized for losing his "Shinjiro style" in this election. To get more support from conservative voters, Koizumi stopped talking about controversial changes like "separate surnames for married couples" and "making it easier to fire workers," which he supported in last year's election. Instead, he focused on "party unity." By trying to avoid mistakes, he seemed to hold himself back.</p>
            <p>After losing to Sanae Takaichi, Koizumi went to a meeting with his supporters. He calmly told them, "Being able to reach the final vote, a goal I could not reach last year, was thanks to all of your help. Even with such great partners, I could not win. This is completely due to my own lack of ability."</p>
            <p>Compared to last year, when he finished third in the first round and did not make it to the final vote, this time he got closer to becoming the leader. He took a step forward.</p>
            <p>Koizumi Shinjiro's father, Koizumi Junichiro, became Prime Minister only after his third attempt. A politician close to Koizumi Shinjiro said, "We will support him until he becomes the leader."</p>
            <p>Supporters in Koizumi's hometown of Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture, said, "It's a pity, but maybe the party members across the country thought he was 'still too young.' He is only 44 years old, and we hope he can get back on his feet and try again in the future."</p>

            <h1>Fubon Guardians Finish Season Last, Coach Chen Chin-Feng Says "Keep Moving Forward"</h1>
            <p>The Fubon Guardians baseball team has finished all 120 games of their season. They ended with 6 wins in a row. Even though they were last with a winning rate of 38.3%, the number of fans at their games grew by 45.79%. Coach Chen Chin-Feng said that the most important thing this year was that young players gained experience. He added, "We need to keep moving forward."</p>
            <p>This season, the Fubon Guardians played 120 regular-season games, winning 46 and losing 74. Their winning rate was 38.3%, putting them in last place. However, the Guardians did very well with ticket sales this season. Today, 10,012 fans came to their last regular-season game at Xinzhuang. For their 60 home games this season, the average number of fans was 10,653. This is 45.79% more than last year.</p>
            <p>After the season, Coach Chen Chin-Feng said that even though things were not always easy, the biggest gain was letting young players get experience and learn how to play games. He said, "Of course, at first, they were not very confident and did not understand the game well. But slowly, after many failures and feeling nervous, they now know what they need to do."</p>
            <p>Chen Chin-Feng also mentioned that the team's lineup was never complete this year. This tested how many good players they had on the bench. He explained, "After this year, there is now someone who can play in every position. It's not like one person has to be in one specific spot. This creates good competition within the team, which is the best experience for them."</p>
            <p>He stressed that the players must keep working hard, look at their own play, and keep moving forward. "As long as you wear this jersey, you must keep working hard. No matter if you played well or badly this year, this year is over. You must keep trying to be better."</p>
            <p>Even though the team's results were not good, many fans still supported the Guardians. Chen Chin-Feng said, "Thank you to the fans for supporting us. We must work harder to get better results. This is what we need to achieve."</p>

            <h1>Shawn Morimando Pitches Well, Wang Nien-Hao Hits Home Run as Guardians Win 6th Straight in Final Game</h1>
            <p>Today, the Fubon Guardians baseball team played their last game of the season at Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium. The Guardians won 7-2 against the Rakuten Monkeys. This win was thanks to Shawn Morimando's great pitching, as he did not let the other team score for 7 innings, and Wang Nien-Hao's 2-run home run. They finished the season with 6 wins in a row, which matches the team's longest winning streak in its history after 6 years.</p>
            <p>The Guardians started scoring runs in the bottom of the 4th inning. Tung Tzu-En got a walk, then Chen Chen and Lin Yueh-Ku hit singles, filling all the bases. After that, the pitcher threw a wild pitch, giving the Guardians 1 run. Pan Wei-Hsiang and Yeh Tzu-Ting then hit singles, scoring 3 more runs. In the bottom of the 6th inning, after Chih En-Chi hit a single that scored 1 run, Wang Nien-Hao hit a 2-run home run off pitcher Su Chun-Chang.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 8th inning, the Monkeys scored 2 runs. But the Guardians still won 7-2, getting their 6th straight win. This ties the team's longest winning streak in its history, which had not happened for 6 years. After the game, Guardians manager Chen Chin-Feng said, "The players now know what to do during games. They can hit the ball well, and our speed is also an advantage. This makes the whole game flow better."</p>
            <p>Chen Chin-Feng stressed that now the players can hit singles at important times. He said, "Even if they don't hit many long balls, they can show their strengths, which is very good for them."</p>
            <p>The Guardians' starting pitcher, Shawn Morimando, threw 93 pitches in this game. He pitched for 7 innings, allowing only 2 hits, with no walks and 7 strikeouts. He did not let the other team score any runs and was named the MVP of the game. In his first season with the Guardians after moving from the CTBC Brothers, Morimando started 23 games, pitched 139 innings, had 10 wins and 10 losses, and his ERA was 2.98.</p>
            <p>Morimando said that today was a good game. "I thank my teammates for their defense and hitting. Catcher Feng-Wei also gave me a lot of confidence. Ending this season with a win is very meaningful." Morimando had elbow ligament surgery in 2023. He said that the most important thing was being able to finish the season healthy this year.</p>
            <p>When asked if he would stay with the Guardians next year, Morimando said his agent would talk to the Guardians to discuss what will happen in the future. He added, "This team feels like a family to me, and I fit in well with everyone."</p>
