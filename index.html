            <h1>Heated Tobacco Products: Two Companies Get Conditional Approval for 14 Items, Government Promises Stricter Rules</h1>
            <p>The Health Promotion Administration announced new progress today. This is about their review of certain tobacco products and their health risks. After careful evaluation, two companies that make heated tobacco products have had 14 of their products approved. This approval comes with certain conditions.</p>
            <p>When these heated tobacco products go on sale, they will be controlled very strictly. The companies must regularly provide information on how the products are monitored and managed after they are sold.</p>

            <h1>EU Considers Stopping Funding for Israeli Startups to Pressure Over Gaza Situation</h1>
            <p>The European Union (EU) suggested stopping funding for Israeli tech startups today. This is because the humanitarian situation in Gaza is getting worse, and many people want the EU to take action against Israel.</p>
            <p>The EU Commission said in a statement, "Even though Israel has said it will stop fighting daily in Gaza for humanitarian help... the situation is still very serious."</p>
            <p>The EU Commission said the plan to stop funding Israel is a "focused and reversible action."</p>
            <p>This suggestion to partly stop Israel from joining the EU's big "Horizon" research program will be talked about by the 27 EU countries tomorrow. Most member countries must agree for it to start.</p>
            <p>The EU is divided. Some members strongly support Israel, while others support the Palestinians more. This makes it hard for the EU to act on the Gaza conflict.</p>
            <p>Officials in Brussels said this plan means the EU will stop giving money to Israeli startup companies that work with drone technology, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>In 2024, Israel, Germany, and France were the top three countries that received funding for these kinds of companies.</p>
            <p>More than 2 million people in Gaza are facing hunger and not enough food. Because of international pressure, Israel agreed this weekend to have "tactical pauses" in fighting in some areas every day.</p>

            <h1>AWS Taiwan and Hong Kong General Manager Wang Ting-kai: "No Cloud, No AI"</h1>
            <p>Wang Ting-kai, who is the general manager for AWS in Taiwan and Hong Kong, said today, "We believe there is no AI without the cloud." He explained that if the internet is turned off, many AI tools that create content would not work. Also, if there is no strong cloud system, the ability of smaller devices to process data will be very limited.</p>
            <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is Amazon's cloud computing service, held a cloud summit in Taiwan today. The event covered topics like AI that creates content, machine learning, data analysis, cloud systems, moving and updating applications, information security, industry uses, and the AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) area.</p>
            <p>In his opening speech, Wang Ting-kai said that many companies want to develop AI that creates content. He advised them to first find "gold" (a good business plan) before buying "shovels" (equipment). This is because shovels are expensive. If they buy them and don't use them, they lose a lot of money as the value drops. This involves high costs and risks with assets, so it's not a good deal.</p>
            <p>Wang Ting-kai stated that AWS and NVIDIA, a big company that makes AI chips, have worked together for 14 years. They use servers like GB200 to build AI systems. This helps create better AI agent applications and allows AI models to work faster.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that Amazon uses very automated technology to manage one million robots worldwide. These robots work with human employees. They are used in automated warehouses, unmanned stores, driverless delivery, and self-driving taxis, which helps save money. By adding AI technology that creates content, robots can find their way automatically. This makes things fully automated, improving efficiency by 10%, using less power, and helping to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
            <p>For example, when Amazon drones deliver packages, they might face risks like air traffic, hitting other planes or helicopters, or dropping packages on people. These problems can be solved with AI computer vision systems. This helps drones see clearly and make decisions when problems happen, making sure they navigate safely.</p>
            <p>Another example is Amazon's plan for low-orbit satellites. Wang Ting-kai said that after satellites are sent into space, they need to find their own orbit, open their solar panels, and set up communication with the ground. This plan aims to launch 3,232 satellites in the next six years, with about 1,600 launched in the next year. By launching them in groups, they will create a network for wireless internet that covers the whole world.</p>
