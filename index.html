            <h1>Premier Zhuo Rongtai: Military Salaries Raised Four Times Since 2018, Government Continues Strong Support</h1>
            <p>Today is September 3rd, Military Day. Premier Zhuo Rongtai shared on Facebook that since 2018, the salaries for Taiwan's soldiers have been raised four times. Each time, salaries increased by 3% to 4%. Last year, the government also increased special payments for soldiers in Dongyin and Juguang areas. This year, they raised special payments for soldiers who volunteer, those in combat units, and those working in cyber warfare, looking for electronic signals, and air traffic control. The government promises to continue giving strong support to the military.</p>
            <p>On Military Day, Premier Zhuo Rongtai said on Facebook that he wants to show his greatest respect to all military heroes. These heroes protect Taiwan's land, sea, and air every day. They also help people during natural disasters. He thanked all soldiers who do their jobs well and stay strong in their work. He said, "The soldiers' help and hard work for Taiwan and for society deserve respect and support from everyone in the country."</p>
            <p>To show support for the military, Premier Zhuo Rongtai said the government asked many businesses to help. Thirty-seven business groups and 62 brands, which means more than 20,000 shops, restaurants, and places for fun, are offering special deals. These deals are for soldiers and their families during the Military Day period. This is the largest number of businesses to join in history.</p>
            <p>He explained that soldiers protect the country all the time, day and night, in every season. He also said that the country takes care of its soldiers not only on Military Day. Since 2018, the total salaries for soldiers have gone up four times, by 3% to 4% each time. The government is also working to make military living spaces better and to improve military equipment.</p>
            <p>Premier Zhuo Rongtai added that besides general salary increases, the government also raised special payments for Dongyin and Juguang areas in July last year. In April this year, they increased special payments for soldiers who volunteer and those in combat units. Then, in June and July this year, they added more special payments for those in cyber warfare, electronic signal detection, and air and sea traffic control.</p>
            <p>He stated that giving more help and care to the military, and being their strongest support, is how the government truly thanks them.</p>

            <h1>Thailand's People's Party Will Support Bhumjaithai Party to Form New Government, Hopes to End Political Problems</h1>
            <p>Thailand's biggest political party in parliament, the People's Party, announced today that it will help the Bhumjaithai Party create the next government. This decision brings hope that the political problems, which started after the Prime Minister was removed, will finally end.</p>
            <p>News agencies Reuters and AFP reported that the People's Party is an opposition party. Its choice to support the Bhumjaithai Party, instead of the ruling Pheu Thai Party, could change everything. This is because the People's Party controls almost one-third of all the seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, the leader of the People's Party, said that his party decided to support Anutin Charnvirakul, the leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, to become the Prime Minister. The reason for this is to stop an old group of parties, which did not do well before, from ruling again.</p>
            <p>However, Natthaphong also said that their support comes with a condition. The parliament must be closed down within four months, and new elections must happen. This is so that "power can be given back to the people as soon as possible."</p>
            <p>He explained, "There is a chance that the old government, which did not manage the country well in the last two years, could come back. Also, the person who led the military takeover could become Prime Minister again." He was talking about General Prayuth Chan-ocha. General Prayuth took power in 2014. Even though he has stopped working in the military, he can still become Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>Last week, on August 29th, the ruling Pheu Thai Party lost its Prime Minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, because of a court decision. This caused a fight for power in Thai politics. The Pheu Thai Party, which Paetongtarn once led, is now trying very hard to make its weak group of allies stronger. At the same time, its old friend, the Bhumjaithai Party, has made a big move to try and form its own government.</p>
