        const text = `**Why Do French People Avoid Air Conditioning? Only 1/4 of Homes Have It Due to Culture and Rules**

Recently, there has been a heatwave in Europe. This has made people look again at why French people don't like air conditioning. Statistics show that only 25% of French people have air conditioning. Even fewer, just 4% of homes, have permanent air conditioners. This is much less than in other nearby countries. People are finding different ways to stay cool in the heat. Those asked said the main reason they don't have air conditioning is not the cost of electricity. Instead, it's about their habits, building rules, and thinking about the environment.

On June 30th, a heatwave hit Europe. This year, the heatwave came unusually early. Cities across Europe were very careful. In Paris, the temperature reached 38 degrees Celsius on July 1st. In the south, it was even hotter, over 40 degrees Celsius.

Because of the heatwave, the city put a large pool in front of the Eiffel Tower, which was closed. This was so people could cool down and have fun. People in Paris used many different ways to deal with the hot weather.

Mathias, who lives in Paris, doesn't have air conditioning at home. His friends in Paris also don't have it. During these hot nights, Mathias told CNA, "I open the windows and use a fan, but my home doesn't get much air. Also, there are mosquitoes, so I slept very badly last night."

Yesterday, he tried to cool down at PÃ¨re Lachaise Cemetery, which is over 40 hectares and the biggest green area in Paris. He also went to an art museum to enjoy the air conditioning and escape the intense heat.

Ananda, who has a small water cooler and a fan at home, told reporters, "If it's very hot, I go to a museum, watch a movie, go shopping, or take a cold shower."

During the heatwave, the discussion about air conditioning became important again. A survey by the French Agency for Ecological Transition (Ademe) in 2020 showed that only about a quarter of homes used air conditioning, including small portable ones.

Data from Synasav, a union for air conditioning repair companies, also showed that only 4% of homes in France have permanent air conditioning. This is much less than in Spain (60%) or Italy (40%). It's also very different from the USA and most Asian countries, where 90% of homes have it.

Ananda believes that electricity cost is not the main reason French people don't install air conditioning. "French people like comfort and care about their quality of life. While electricity cost might be a small reason, the main reasons are rules and habits," she said.

Monique told CNA, "Like many people, the high temperature makes me uncomfortable. My workplace also has no air conditioning. We do talk about air conditioning, but it's not good for the Earth. We don't really want to use it. Maybe there are other ways. We use fans."

Talking about why French people don't like air conditioning, Mathias said he doesn't like using it. Even when he goes to other countries with air conditioning, he turns it off. "I think it makes me sick, like a sore throat," he said.

He added, "We don't have this habit. We're afraid of getting sick. Air conditioners aren't sold much in stores here. We just don't have the habit. Also, it seems we like to be tough and put up with high temperatures, even if it's a bit too much."

Building rules are another reason why people in Paris cannot choose air conditioning. Monique pointed out that buildings are controlled, and you cannot change them easily. The government encourages people to focus on keeping heat out from the inside first.

Elena lives in an old, historical house, so she cannot install permanent air conditioning. "Many buildings here are from the 18th century. Because they are protected as historical sites, we can't even change the windows, let alone install air conditioning," she explained.

Regarding environmental concerns, Mathias said that keeping one's home cool but making the city and Earth hotter doesn't seem like a good solution. "Of course, it's nice to have air conditioning in places like cinemas. But we should try to use less energy, create less pollution, and make cities greener," he said.

Monique said she is lucky to live on the first floor. Her floor is tiled, and there are big trees in the alley. So, her home is at least 5 degrees cooler than outside. "I think we should plant more trees in cities, especially in cities with many buildings. Start there, and also green roofs. I don't know much about technology, but maybe there are new technologies that can replace air conditioning," she suggested.

Elena worried that if everyone installed air conditioning, it would make the outside even hotter, causing a "bad cycle." But she also felt that people living on the top floor really suffer.

However, on July 2nd, a reporter visited a home goods store and found that all the portable air conditioners were gone from the shelves. An employee said that the heatwave in the past two days caused sales to go up very quickly.

The people interviewed also admitted that air conditioning will become more common in the future. Mathias believes that it's getting hotter every year, and heatwaves are coming earlier. So, people will eventually accept air conditioning.

Monique noted, "It's true that more people are installing air conditioning. But many people still resist it for the environment." However, "public transport still needs air conditioning, otherwise it's just too uncomfortable."

Ananda also said, "More and more people want air conditioning. We used to be used to not having it, but now with more heatwaves, habits are changing. French people think air conditioning causes sore throats, is bad for the body, and bad for the planet."

Nearly 2,000 schools in France closed on July 1st, starting summer break early. Yang Yi-lin, a Taiwanese actor living in France for over 20 years, told CNA that her daughter's classroom only had one fan. The city government sent a notice that day, asking parents to pick up their children at noon if possible. Her son wanted to stay in school with his friends, but the next day, the principal told him the school was closed.

Yang Yi-lin said that common ways for people in Paris to stay cool at home are to close sunshades and pull down curtains early in the morning before it gets too hot, to keep the heat out. Then, they put all the fans in the living room, and the family spends time there together to save electricity.

"I think cinemas are full of people these days, or museums and other places where people know there's air conditioning. Even though people don't want to install air conditioning at home, at times like this, they still want to go to places that have it. Parks and squares also have water sprinklers for children to play in," she said.

She doesn't want to buy an air conditioner. "After all, heatwaves only last a few days, so I don't think it's necessary, and I'm not used to air conditioning. Even though it's very hot, you can get through a few days by drinking a lot of water," she said.

**Brazil's Donkeys Are in Danger Due to China's High Demand for Ejiao**

(CNA reporter Tang Ya-ling, Sao Paulo, July 2nd) A report from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) says that China's growing need for collagen from donkey hides has caused the number of donkeys in Brazil to drop by 94%. From 1990 to 2024, the number went down from 1.37 million donkeys to just 78,000.

From June 26th to 28th, the 3rd International Donkey Symposium was held in Maceio, a city in northeast Brazil. During this meeting, a campaign was started to stop the killing of Brazilian donkeys. The aim is to get the Brazilian Congress to pass a law against it.

Since 2016, more and more donkeys have been killed in Brazil. Their hides are sent to China, where they are boiled down to make "Ejiao." This is a traditional Chinese medicine from animals that has health benefits.

According to Chinese medicine texts, Ejiao can help with health problems like irregular periods, anemia, trouble sleeping, and even sexual problems. It is known as a valuable product for beauty and for improving blood.

China's need for Ejiao means that 5.9 million donkeys are killed worldwide each year. This extreme exploitation and killing of donkeys has very big negative effects on the economy, society, and the environment.

In Brazil's history, donkeys were used for transport and farm work. But in the last ten years, the economy in the northeast has grown, and farming has become more automated. This has led to thousands of donkeys being left on the sides of roads. This causes more road accidents in the northeastern states, and these animals can easily be hunted for their hides in illegal trade.

The Brazilian government once thought about encouraging people to eat donkey meat. But they did not do it because of cultural reasons. Donkeys are seen as a symbol of the northeast, so people refuse to eat their meat.

Right now, there are three slaughterhouses in Brazil that have permission from the Federal Inspection Service (SIF) to kill donkeys in Brazil. All of these slaughterhouses are in the state of Bahia, in northeast Brazil.

Environmentalists in Brazil are calling for a stop, saying that killing donkeys has become unsustainable. Brazilian donkeys are not just a product; they are living creatures that take a long time to have babies, so their numbers cannot keep up with how fast they are being killed. The loss of a species is different from losing a resource like minerals or crops, which can be replaced. Losing a species means a permanent loss.

**Vietnam and US Leaders Talk: Trump Says Tariffs on Vietnamese Goods Will Be Greatly Reduced**

(CNA reporter Chen Chia-lun, Hanoi, July 3rd) On the evening of July 2nd, To Lam, the General Secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party, spoke with US President Donald Trump. They discussed the relationship between Vietnam and the US, and the issue of tariffs. Vietnam's press release said that Trump promised to greatly lower the tariffs on many Vietnamese products sold to the US. He also said they would keep working together to fix problems with trade.

In early April, Donald Trump said the US would put a 46% tariff on goods from Vietnam. But then, he paused this decision for 90 days. During this time, Vietnam talked with the US, hoping to get rid of this 46% tariff after July 9th, when the pause ends.

Vietnam's Foreign Ministry reported that during their call tonight, To Lam and Trump were happy about the strong and close relationship between their two countries. Both leaders welcomed the fact that their negotiation teams had agreed on a "Joint Statement on the Framework for a Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade Agreement between Vietnam and the US."

The report also said that Trump praised Vietnam's promise to let more American goods into their market, including cars with large engines. Trump stressed that the US will greatly reduce tariffs on many products imported from Vietnam. He also said that the US will keep working with Vietnam to solve trade problems, especially in areas that both countries care about most.

To Lam suggested that the US should recognize Vietnam as a market economy soon. He also asked the US to remove some limits on exporting high-tech products to Vietnam.

To Lam and Trump also talked about the main direction and steps to improve the overall strategic partnership between their two countries in the future.

The report stated that both leaders agreed to increase visits between their officials and leaders at all levels. They also agreed to improve cooperation in economy, trade, and investment, especially in important and new areas like science and high technology.

At this time, To Lam invited Trump and his wife to visit Vietnam again. He also said he hopes to meet Trump again soon. Trump thanked To Lam for the invitation and also hoped to see him again soon.

To Lam also spoke with Trump on the evening of April 4th about the same tariff issue. At that time, he said that Vietnam was willing to lower its import tariffs on goods from the US to 0%. He also suggested that the US should put a similar tariff rate on goods from Vietnam.
