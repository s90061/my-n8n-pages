            <h1>Typhoon Willow Hits Taiwan: Taoyuan Airport Ties Down Jet Bridges and Improves Storm Preparations</h1>
            <p>Taoyuan Airport Company said that Typhoon Willow has hit Taiwan. All units have started tying down jet bridges and other storm preparations. Because of the typhoon, 49 passenger flights and 15 cargo flights were cancelled. Also, as of 3:19 PM, 26 flights had to land at other airports.</p>
            <p>The airport company released a press statement this afternoon. It said that Typhoon Willow has arrived. According to the airport company's numbers, a total of 663 flights were planned for today. 64 flights were cancelled due to the typhoon, including 49 passenger flights and 15 cargo flights. Travelers and people picking them up are asked to check the latest flight information before leaving. They should also confirm transportation details to make sure their journey goes smoothly.</p>
            <p>The airport company pointed out that they started various storm preparations before the typhoon warning was issued. These include checking airport power, air conditioning, water supply and drainage, electric trains, and jet bridges. They also increased checks on all construction areas, main drainage lines, and airside areas.</p>
            <p>The airport company stated that the Taoyuan Aviation Weather Station predicted strong side winds starting from 11 AM due to Typhoon Willow. Flights leaving the airport could depart without problems. However, for safety reasons, some arriving flights had to go around or land at other airports. As of 3:19 PM, 26 flights were diverted to other airports because of wind shear. Also, starting from 11:50 AM, the viewing platforms on the 5th floor of Terminal 2 (north and south sides) were temporarily closed. There is no set time for them to reopen yet.</p>
            <p>The airport company said that airlines will change their flight plans as new weather information comes in. Travelers are asked to pay attention to airline notices and can check flight updates on the official website or app. The airport company's official website will also continue to update flight changes and transportation information for travelers and the public.</p>
            <p>The airport company held its third emergency meeting this morning. Chairman Yang Wei-fu led the meeting. He listened to updates on the typhoon and reports on preparations from different departments and domestic airlines. He told all units to be more careful, strictly follow storm measures, and stay alert. If any problems happen, they should report them immediately to keep the airport safe and protect travelers' rights.</p>

            <h1>Tung Ruey-bin: Use Technology to Fight Fraud, Hopes Telecoms Lower SMS Short Code Fees</h1>
            <p>Tung Ruey-bin, chairman of Mega Financial Holdings and head of the Bankers Association, said today that financial fraud methods are changing quickly. Banks must do more than just help customers in person and check new accounts better. They also need to improve technology to stop fraud. For example, Mega Bank has started a system to stop fraud using short SMS codes. But each message costs NT$0.4, which will cost nearly NT$10 million per year. So, the Bankers Association has talked to the three big telecom companies, hoping they will lower the fees.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance held the 2025 Financial Technology Anti-Fraud Summit today. Minister without Portfolio Kung Ming-hsin and Tung Ruey-bin spoke at the event. They announced the start of the Bankers Association's Anti-Fraud Communication Platform. They also joined the "Banks and Police Work Together 165" campaign. Their goal is to hold 165 anti-fraud education events by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>Tung Ruey-bin said that current financial fraud methods are changing rapidly. They have moved from old phone scams and fake relationships to using AI technology to steal people's money. This is a big problem for Taiwan and other countries. The Bankers Association actively supports the Executive Yuan's "New Generation Anti-Fraud Strategy Action Plan 2.0." It helps financial institutions act as "gatekeepers" against fraud, using methods like in-person care to prevent people from being tricked.</p>
            <p>Tung Ruey-bin admitted that frontline staff face a lot of pressure. It is very hard to stop any amount of money from being lost. According to statistics, in 2023, financial institutions across Taiwan stopped over 11,000 cases and saved about NT$7.6 billion. In 2024, they stopped over 13,000 cases and saved over NT$10 billion. In the first half of 2025, they stopped over 7,600 cases and saved NT$5.9 billion.</p>
            <p>Tung Ruey-bin mentioned that Mega Bank stopped about NT$200 to 300 million in fraud in the first half of this year. In one case, they stopped over NT$30 million for just one person, which is quite remarkable.</p>
            <p>Tung Ruey-bin believes that financial institutions must keep improving how they help customers in person, check new accounts, and watch accounts. They also need to keep making their anti-fraud technology better. For example, they can use computer systems to help find unusual account activities, manage virtual account risks differently based on how high the risk is, and start SMS anti-fraud systems.</p>
            <p>Mega Bank has already started using a short SMS code system to prevent fraud. If people receive a message starting with "68017," they can be sure the message is from Mega Bank.</p>
            <p>Tung Ruey-bin also pointed out that Mega Bank sends over 20 million SMS messages each year. Each message with a short code costs NT$0.4. This means the yearly cost is almost NT$10 million. For other banks that have many cards in use, they might send 100 million messages a year, costing over NT$40 million. So, the Bankers Association has talked to the three telecom companies. They hope that for the good of society, these companies can lower the fees for short SMS codes.</p>
            <p>Kung Ming-hsin, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, said he hopes that the national anti-fraud team and the financial industry can work together. This will help prevent fraud and increase awareness about financial crime. It will also remind people to be careful of scams and protect their money. Kung Ming-hsin noted that fraud groups are now using new technologies for scams. They are highly organized, large-scale, and work across borders. In the future, anti-fraud plans must change. Besides teamwork, they also need to combine resources from different government departments, financial institutions, and private companies. They should also use digital technology to create new ways to fight fraud. For example, using AI technology can save human effort and make anti-fraud efforts more accurate. This can help with early warnings and stopping fraud before it happens.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Willow Hits Taiwan: 33 Injured, 1 Fisherman Missing</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow landed in Taimali Township, Taitung County, this afternoon. By around 4 PM, it had moved out to sea from Cigu, Tainan. According to the Central Emergency Operation Center's numbers as of 2 PM, Willow has caused one fisherman to go missing and 33 people to be injured.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center held its sixth meeting on Typhoon Willow this afternoon. President Lai Ching-te visited to check on how central units were responding to the typhoon. The report showed that as of 2 PM, Willow had caused 33 injuries and 1 missing person. Most of the injured, 13 people each, were in Kaohsiung City and Taitung County.</p>
            <p>Regarding the missing person, the report said that a 28-year-old man named Lin and his friends were fishing around 1 PM at the Haomei Village dike in Budai Township, Chiayi County. Mr. Lin was swept away by a wave and disappeared. This area is an alert zone set by Chiayi County. Coast Guard and fire department teams are still actively searching.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center said that Typhoon Willow continues to affect Taiwan's land. It has a big impact on the eastern, southern, and outlying islands. Due to the typhoon's outer winds, coastal areas in the east should be careful of long waves. Since it is summer vacation, people should not go to the beach to watch waves or do water activities.</p>
            <p>Also, the typhoon's heavy rain is affecting the eastern and southern parts of the country and mountain areas in central and southern Taiwan. Low-lying coastal areas and places that easily flood should watch out for short periods of heavy rain that can cause flooding. The Central Emergency Operation Center's data as of 2:30 PM showed that 1,825 alert zones have been set up nationwide. Most of these are in mountain areas and near rivers. They are located in Hsinchu County and City, Nantou County, Taitung County, and other areas.</p>
            <p>Also as of 2:30 PM, a total of 102 mudslide yellow alerts were issued, mostly in Pingtung County and Kaohsiung City. These also included Hualien County and Taitung County. Four large-scale landslide yellow alerts were issued, also in these four counties.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center said that as of 3 PM, the typhoon had caused power outages for over 130,000 households across the country. More than 76,000 households have had their power restored, and over 58,000 households are still without power. These include areas in Taitung County, Hualien County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, Miaoli County, Taoyuan City, and Nantou County. Taitung County had the most outages. If the local weather allows, Taiwan Power Company staff at those locations will repair the power lines immediately.</p>
            <p>Regarding fruit and vegetable trading, the Taipei Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Market had a trading volume of 1,294 metric tons today, slightly less than yesterday by 25 metric tons. The average price per kilogram was NT$63.1, which was NT$5.9 lower than yesterday. The supply was less today because buyers needed less, so market prices went down.</p>
            <p>The Xiluo Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Market had a trading volume of 504 metric tons today, an increase of 25 metric tons from yesterday. The average price per kilogram was NT$71.9, a small increase of NT$0.9 from yesterday. The supply increased today because demand was still high during the typhoon period, so prices rose slightly. As for rolling vegetable storage, the current stock is 5,340 metric tons. From July 18 to August 13, 1,270 metric tons have been released.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center's numbers as of 1 PM showed that 64 shelters have been set up in Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, Hualien County, and Taitung County. These shelters are housing 905 people.</p>
