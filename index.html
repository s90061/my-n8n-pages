            <h1>After Thailand and Cambodia agree to stop fighting, Trump says he helped and talks to both leaders again.</h1>
            <p>Earlier today, the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia said they would stop fighting. After this, former US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to both leaders. He also said he helped them reach this agreement.</p>
            <p>The news agency AFP reported that Trump wrote on his social media page, "Truth Social," "I just spoke with the acting Prime Minister of Thailand and the Prime Minister of Cambodia. I am happy to say that after President Trump got involved, both countries agreed to stop fighting and have peace. Congratulations to everyone!"</p>
            <p>He also added, "I have told my trade team to start trade talks again."</p>
            <p>On July 26, Trump had said that he talked to Hun Manet, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, and Phumtham Wechayachai, the acting Prime Minister of Thailand. He asked them to stop fighting. He also said that the US was talking about trade with both countries. He made it clear that if they kept fighting, the US would not make any trade deals with them.</p>
            <p>After five days of fighting between Thailand and Cambodia near their border, Kaja Kallas, who is in charge of foreign policy and security for the European Union, also praised their decision to stop fighting.</p>
            <p>Kallas wrote on X (a social media platform), "The agreement for Cambodia and Thailand to stop fighting is a big step forward after several days of deadly conflict. It is very important that both countries truly follow the agreement."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Phumtham and Hun Manet met in Malaysia to talk about stopping the fighting. After the meeting, Anwar Ibrahim, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, announced that Thailand and Cambodia would stop fighting without any conditions. This agreement started at midnight on July 28.</p>

            <h1>Russian airline attacked by hackers who support Ukraine, over 40 flights canceled.</h1>
            <p>Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, was attacked by computer hackers. A group of hackers who support Ukraine said they did it. Because of this, Aeroflot had to cancel more than 40 flights today. Most of these were flights inside Russia. Some flights to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, were also canceled. At least 10 other flights were delayed. The Kremlin said the situation is concerning.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Aeroflot canceled these flights after saying their computer systems had problems. The airline did not say how long it would take to fix the problem. However, at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, the flight boards showed many canceled flights. This is happening when many Russians are traveling for their holidays.</p>
            <p>A hacker group called "Silent Crow" released a statement. They said they did this attack with a Belarusian group called Cyberpartisans BY. They said the attack is connected to Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!" Reuters could not confirm if this statement was real, and Ukraine has not commented on it yet.</p>
            <p>Silent Crow has said they were responsible for other hacker attacks this year. Their targets included Russia's property information, Russia's national phone company, a large insurance company, Moscow city's computer department, and the Russian office of the Korean car company KIA.</p>
            <p>Russian prosecutors have said that today's computer problem was caused by a hacker attack. They have started a criminal investigation.</p>
            <p>Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for the Kremlin, said, "The information we are reading in public right now is quite worrying. The threat from hackers is still a problem for all big companies that offer services to the public."</p>
