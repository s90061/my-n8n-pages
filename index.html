            <h1>US Threat to Close TikTok Made China Agree to a Deal, Says Bessent</h1>
            <p>Madrid, September 15th â€“ Scott Bessent, the US Secretary of the Treasury, said that the US government's threat to shut down TikTok made Chinese negotiators change their minds. China had wanted the US to remove tariffs (extra taxes on goods) if China took its money out of TikTok. This threat led to a basic agreement between the two countries in Madrid today.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bessent explained that this agreement's business parts will protect US national security. At the same time, it will keep TikTok's "Chinese characteristics." He added that the next meeting between the US and China might happen before November 10th. This is when the current break in tariffs ends. It is also possible to extend this break for another 90 days.</p>
            <p>Today, Mr. Bessent spoke to Reuters and Bloomberg News in Madrid. He said that Chinese negotiators came to this meeting with many demands for "payment" related to the TikTok deal. These demands included removing the latest tariffs that former President Trump put in place, older tariffs, and US controls on sending technology abroad.</p>
            <p>When talking about the Chinese group in Madrid, Mr. Bessent said, "They do not want TikTok to close. They did not truly understand or believe that the President wanted to stop TikTok from working." He also said, "I think we changed how they saw things."</p>
            <p>He said that President Trump gave him and US trade representative Jamieson Greer a lot of power to negotiate. They also "made the Chinese side realize that we would not give in a lot."</p>
            <p>Mr. Bessent stated that the US did not agree to remove current tariffs and trade rules. Instead, it agreed not to take certain actions in the future. He said, "So, they basically got a promise that some things will not happen in the future, instead of removing current rules."</p>
            <p>He did not want to share exact details about what the US gave up regarding TikTok. He only said that China's requests for some "process-related" things were also met.</p>
            <p>A person who knew about the Madrid talks said that another reason China agreed was a message from the US team. The message was that if a basic TikTok agreement was not made in Madrid, then a meeting expected this autumn between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might not happen.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bessent did not want to talk about the business parts of the agreement or what will happen to TikTok's main computer code. However, he said that the US side is "very happy" with the parts of the agreement related to national security.</p>
