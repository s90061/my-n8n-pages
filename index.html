(Washington D.C., July 15, Central News Agency) Government data released today shows that consumer inflation in the United States increased in June. This matches what analysts expected.

According to Agence France-Presse, the U.S. Labor Department stated that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June went up by 2.7% compared to last year. This increase was due to higher energy costs. The 2.7% rise is more than the 2.4% increase seen in May.

***Huang Tzu-Peng Sent to Minor League to Fix Pitching Control; Lin Li's Return Time Up to Him***

(Taoyuan, July 15, Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Ching-Wen) On July 13, the Rakuten Monkeys baseball team sent pitcher Huang Tzu-Peng to the minor league. Head coach Ko Kyu-Bom said that Huang needs to fix his pitching control. So, Huang Tzu-Peng will work on this in the minor league. As for when Lin Li will come back to play, the coach said it's up to Lin Li and the team's medical staff to decide.

Monkeys pitcher Huang Tzu-Peng started a game on July 5. He pitched for 3.1 innings. During this time, he allowed 10 hits and 7 earned runs, leading to a loss. He was then sent to the minor league on July 13.

Head coach Ko Kyu-Bom spoke to reporters before today's game. He said they had already planned for Huang Tzu-Peng to go to the minor league to improve. However, due to some reasons, the change happened a bit later. When asked what Huang Tzu-Peng needs to work on, Ko Kyu-Bom said he could not share all the details. But, he generally stated that it is a problem with pitching control.

Monkeys foreign pitcher Marcelo Martinez also struggled in his start on July 12, giving up many runs. He pitched 4.1 innings, allowed 8 hits, including 1 home run, and gave up 8 runs (7 earned runs). He took the loss.

Ko Kyu-Bom thought that Marcelo Martinez might not have adjusted well because there was a long break between his last two starts. Also, playing in Kaohsiung, where the weather is hotter, might have affected him.

Regarding infielder Lin Li's condition, Ko Kyu-Bom said that Lin Li's physical condition seems worse this year compared to last year. However, the coach did not set a date for his return. Lin Li will talk with the medical staff, and he will return when he feels ready.
