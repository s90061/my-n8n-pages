            <p>He also said, "At the same time, Russia still wants to keep talking. They want to reach their goals using talks and peace efforts."</p>
            <p>Also, the Russian army said today that they used very fast missiles to attack Ukrainian military bases during the night.</p>

            <h1>Financial Watchdog to Regulate Lending and Leasing Firms; First 13 Start on September 15</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said today that it plans to oversee 41 lending and leasing companies by September next year. This will happen in three steps. In the first step, 13 companies from four big groups (Chailease, Yulon Finance, Hotai Finance, and Jih Sun Taiwan Finance) will start to follow the rules of the Financial Consumer Protection Act on September 15. If these companies break the rules in their contracts, people can complain to the dispute resolution center.</p>
            <p>At the end of June, the FSC first announced that 12 lending and leasing companies would be regulated. But the FSC understood that companies need time to change their contracts, update their internal systems, and train their staff. So, the new rules will begin on September 15.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Hsien, who leads the FSC's Legal Affairs Department, explained this at a regular press conference. He said that Chailease Finance told the FSC that one of its companies, Chuang Chu Limited Partnership, will still buy accounts receivable, offer installment plans, or do similar lending for regular people. Because of this, "Chuang Chu Limited Partnership" was added to the list. So, the first group of regulated companies changed from 12 to 13.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Hsien said that new companies will be added every six months. In the second step, 13 lending and leasing companies that banks have invested in will be added around mid-March next year. In the third step, the remaining 15 member companies of the Taipei Leasing Association will also follow the Financial Consumer Protection Act. By mid-September next year, a total of 41 lending and leasing companies will be regulated.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Hsien also explained that companies must follow specific rules. For example, when they advertise or promote their services, they must clearly show interest rates and fees. They must also tell customers about the costs and late payment fees. Second, if a lending and leasing company asks another company to help with promotion, it must make sure the helper's ads and promotions follow the rules. They must also have a system to check and manage this.</p>
            <p>Third, lending and leasing companies must "Know Your Customer" (KYC) to make sure customers can pay back loans and understand the risks. Fourth, the money they lend cannot be more than the value of the item being bought. Fifth, when they collect overdue payments themselves or through another company, they cannot use violent methods. They must also have rules for choosing outside collection agencies.</p>
            <p>Sixth, lending and leasing companies cannot stop customers from paying back early. If they charge a fee for early payment, the contract must clearly say how this fee is calculated. Seventh, these companies cannot sign for customers or let customers sign blank promissory notes. If a customer pays late, the company can only charge either a penalty for breaking the contract or late payment interest, not both.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Hsien pointed out that if companies break these rules, they can be fined between NT$300,000 and NT$10 million, according to Article 30-1 of the Financial Consumer Protection Act. The new rules do not apply to past events. So, starting from September 15, companies must follow this law. If there is a problem, people can complain to the dispute resolution center. If a case happened before September 15, the FSC will send the complaint to the Taipei Leasing Association, which will ask the company to handle it properly.</p>

            <h1>Weng Hsiao-ling Says Tsao Hsing-cheng Did Not Donate Money to Tsing Hua University; Tsao Loses Lawsuit</h1>
            <p>Weng Hsiao-ling, a lawmaker from the Kuomintang party, said that Tsao Hsing-cheng, the former boss of UMC, promised to give 15 million New Taiwan dollars to Tsing Hua University but did not. Tsao Hsing-cheng then sued Weng Hsiao-ling and asked for more than 40 million New Taiwan dollars in return. Today, the Taipei District Court decided that Tsao Hsing-cheng lost the case. He can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Weng Hsiao-ling wrote on Facebook. She said that in 1995, Shen Chun-shan, who was the president of Tsing Hua University at the time, played a game of chess with Tsao Hsing-cheng to help raise money for the university. They agreed that for every piece Shen won, Tsao would donate 10,000. Shen thought it was NT dollars, but later he found out it was US dollars. Shen won 50 pieces, which meant 500,000 US dollars. This story became well-known in education circles. Weng said that, as far as she knows, Tsing Hua University has not received Tsao Hsing-cheng's donation yet.</p>
            <p>Tsao Hsing-cheng believed that Weng Hsiao-ling did not check her facts carefully and purposely said bad things about him. So, he filed a lawsuit, asking Weng Hsiao-ling for 40,987,736 NT dollars plus interest.</p>
            <p>At that time, Tsao Hsing-cheng wrote that he was asking Weng Hsiao-ling for over 40 million NT dollars. This amount was calculated from Weng Hsiao-ling's salary, assistant fees, office rent, and travel money during her four years as a lawmaker. He said this money comes from taxpayers and should be used for the public good. But Weng Hsiao-ling's actions have clearly gone against her duties as a lawmaker, so she should return all the money for fairness. If the court decides that she must pay him, he will donate all of it to National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.</p>
            <p>After looking at the case, the Taipei District Court thought that Weng Hsiao-ling's post was based on news reports, the Tsing Hua University website, and Facebook posts. She had good reasons to believe that what she said was true. Tsao Hsing-cheng did not show proof that Weng Hsiao-ling knew the information was false and made it up on purpose. He also could not prove that she was very careless or negligent and did not check if the information was true. This means he could not prove that she failed to do her duty to check facts carefully.</p>
            <p>The court's decision said that Tsao Hsing-cheng was the main person who wanted to remove another Kuomintang lawmaker, Hsu Chiao-hsin, from her position. His character and actions are connected to the public good, which means people can talk about them openly. Also, looking at Weng Hsiao-ling's post and when she wrote it, it is clear that her reason for posting was not just to harm Tsao Hsing-cheng's reputation. Instead, she was giving her opinion on something she had good reason to believe was true.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court decided that Weng Hsiao-ling's post also answered Tsao Hsing-cheng's comments on Facebook. Tsao had suggested that several lawmakers, including her, and Tsing Hua University might be influenced by China. Weng's response was her opinion on something that people can discuss openly. It was a fair comment and should be protected by the freedom of speech in the constitution. Because of this, the court decided that Tsao Hsing-cheng lost his case. He can appeal the decision.</p>
