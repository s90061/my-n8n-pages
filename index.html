            <h1>China Hackers Pretend to Be US Lawmakers to Spy on Trade Talks</h1>
            <p>People who know about this said that before the US and China trade talks in July, Chinese hackers pretended to be the head of a special US committee. They sent letters asking for opinions on sanctions against China. They did this to put spy software on computers of groups that give advice. This is the latest example of China's spy activities.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that staff from the US House of Representatives' special committee on US-China competition, many trade groups, law firms, and government offices received letters. These letters seemed to be from John Moolenaar, a Republican congressman from Michigan and the committee's head. They asked the people who got them to share their thoughts on new punishments for Beijing from Congress.</p>
            <p>Sources said the emails said, "Your ideas are very important." They also asked people to look at a draft law in an attachment. But this email was sent from an email address that was not a government one, which made people suspicious.</p>
            <p>The report said this is a new case of online spying from Beijing. It might have aimed to put spy software on groups that gave advice to the Trump team for trade talks.</p>
            <p>The American FBI and US Congress Police are looking into these fake emails sent in Moolenaar's name. Computer security experts found that a hacker group called APT41 put bad software in the emails. Many believe APT41 works for China's Ministry of State Security.</p>
            <p>A few days after the fake emails were sent, US and Chinese officials had their third round of trade talks in Stockholm, Sweden, at the end of July. After that, both countries agreed to extend their tariff break until early November. At that time, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might meet at the APEC meeting.</p>
            <p>This hacking action wanted to let high-level Chinese officials see the advice Trump was getting from outside groups. It is not yet clear if the hackers successfully broke into any targets.</p>
            <p>An FBI spokesperson did not want to share details. They said the FBI knows about it and is "working with partners to find the people responsible." The US Congress Police did not comment.</p>
            <p>Moolenaar released a statement saying this event shows again that Beijing wants to steal and use American plans through cyberattacks. He added, "We will not be scared by this."</p>
            <p>Chinese officials said the accusations are not true. They said these claims are just Washington trying to make people stop looking at its own strong actions. The Chinese Embassy in the US said China strongly opposes and fights cyberattacks. It also said it is against "slandering others without clear proof."</p>
            <p>The report said that when this hacking happened, American police were surprised by how varied and bold China's online spying was. The FBI said last month that spy actions linked to Beijing not only targeted US phone companies but also stole Trump's call records. In fact, targets were in over 80 countries worldwide.</p>
            <p>China wanted to use Moolenaar to trick people, which made the committee staff very angry. This is because Moolenaar has often strongly criticized Beijing. In January, he said that China's leaders "see the United States as an enemy that must be harmed, not a partner."</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal noted that a cybersecurity company called Mandiant found that if someone opened the attached "draft law," hackers could use spy software in the email to get deep inside the target organization.</p>

            <h1>Lee Jae-myung Government Changes: Prosecutor's Office and Ministry of Economy and Finance to Split Powers</h1>
            <p>The South Korean government today announced a plan to change its structure. They will remove the Prosecutor's Office and divide the powers of prosecutors, such as bringing charges and investigating, into two different groups. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will also be split into a Budget Office and a Ministry of Economy and Finance. These new changes will start one year after they are officially approved and announced.</p>
            <p>Today, the South Korean government announced its first major change since President Lee Jae-myung took office. It will divide the duties of the Prosecutor's Office and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which many people thought had too much power.</p>
            <p>The new plan will close the Prosecutor's Office. Instead, there will be a Public Prosecution Office and a Serious Crime Investigation Office. These two new offices will take over the powers of prosecutors, such as charging people with crimes and investigating them. The Public Prosecution Office will be under the Ministry of Justice, and the Serious Crime Investigation Office will be under the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.</p>
            <p>To do this, the Prime Minister's Office will create a "Government-wide Prosecutor System Reform Promotion Group." This group will work closely with the ruling party, the government, and the President's office to make detailed plans.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economy and Finance will also be split into a Planning and Budget Office and a Ministry of Economy and Finance. The Planning and Budget Office will be new and will work under the Prime Minister. It will manage tasks like making the budget and controlling spending. The old Ministry of Economy and Finance will be renamed the Ministry of Economy and Finance. It will handle economic policies, tax systems, and government money. The Vice Prime Minister for Economic Affairs will also be the head of this new Ministry of Economy and Finance.</p>
            <p>At the same time, tasks related to money, such as financial information analysis from the Financial Services Commission, will be given to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The Financial Services Commission will change its structure and mainly focus on overseeing financial activities.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry of Environment will take over energy policy work from the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy. It will become bigger and be renamed the Ministry of Climate, Energy, and Environment. The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, without its energy duties, will be renamed the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family will change its structure and be renamed the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. It will create a new office for gender equality policies.</p>
            <p>For the Vice Prime Minister roles, to keep up with industry trends, the new plan will remove the position of Vice Prime Minister for Social Affairs. A new Vice Prime Minister for Science and Technology will be created. The Ministry of Science and ICT will also create a new department specifically for artificial intelligence-related tasks.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rain in Taichung Causes River to Flood Bridge, Couple Stuck for 1 Hour</h1>
            <p>In Taichung City this evening, there was heavy rain. The Toubiokeng River in Taiping District rose quickly. A couple could not cross a bridge because the water covered it. Police and firefighters were called to help. They waited for the river water to go down a little, then helped the two people get out. The couple was stuck for one hour. After that, the police took them home safely.</p>
            <p>At 6:11 PM, the Taichung City Fire Bureau received a report. People were stuck due to heavy rain in Nangou Lane, Section 2, Changlong Road, Taiping District. A local fire team was sent. They used 8 fire trucks, 1 ambulance, 2 boats, and 14 firefighters to go and help.</p>
            <p>When the firefighters arrived, they found two people who were coming down the mountain. Heavy rain had made the river rise fast, and the bridge was underwater. The people were stuck and staying in a safer area for a while. Firefighters waited for the river water to go down a little. Then, they walked through the water to reach the two stuck people. They helped them put on life jackets and then led them across the bridge. They were successfully brought to a safe part of the road further down the mountain.</p>
            <p>Police from Taiping District, along with firefighters, arrived at the scene. They found out that Mr. and Mrs. Hsieh were working on the mountain. Later, because of the heavy rain, the river rose very quickly, and they could not cross the bridge, so they got stuck. After the couple was rescued, police officers took them back to the police station to rest. Since their vehicle was still on the mountain, the officers drove them home.</p>
