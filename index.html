            <h1>Lin Kuo-cheng Denies Pressuring Public Banks, Says He Only Asked Questions</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 22 (CNA) Mirror Weekly reported that Legislator Lin Kuo-cheng from the Taiwan People's Party might have put pressure on banks owned by the government. The report also said he asked for special papers to vote in an election for a golf club. Today, Lin Kuo-cheng said in a statement that he only called to ask questions in a normal way, after a voter asked him for help. He believes the report has damaged his good name and he will consider taking legal action.</p>
            <p>Recently, Lin Kuo-cheng got attention for using bad words about President Lai Ching-te during a party meeting. Mirror Weekly reported yesterday that Lin Kuo-cheng had other problems. They said he pressured public banks to get proxy forms for an election at the Taipei Golf Club. This was seen as using his power wrongly for his own benefit.</p>
            <p>About the Mirror Weekly report, Lin Kuo-cheng said today that the report is not true. He made three points. First, he said Mirror Weekly published the report without checking with him first. This is against good rules for news and checking facts, and he wants to protest this.</p>
            <p>Lin Kuo-cheng also said that this was a normal service for voters. His office received a request from a voter, and he helped by making phone calls within the law. He said he did not force anyone or put any pressure on them. He also said he did not use his power wrongly. If Mirror Weekly has proof, he asked them to show it, instead of just hinting and making false accusations.</p>
            <p>Lin Kuo-cheng stated that several other legislators from different parties also help with similar requests from voters. He said that Mirror Weekly did not check their facts and chose to only report about him, which has hurt his good name. He expressed his sadness and anger about this false report and said he will consider taking legal action.</p>

            <h1>Second Phase of Erren River Cleanup to Focus on 4 Areas</h1>
            <p>Tainan, July 22 (CNA) The Tainan City Government said today that the central government has approved over NT$1.3 billion for the "Second Phase of Erren River Waste Cleanup Project." They plan to remove 22,000 tons of waste from the Erren River by 2028. This plan will focus on 4 specific areas along the river that still need to be cleaned.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Environmental Protection Bureau said today that the second phase of the Erren River cleanup will focus on 4 areas in Tainan and Kaohsiung that have not been cleaned yet. Tainan City will manage the cleanup and improvement work. They will use new technology to sort the pollutants, which will help lower the cost of cleanup and cause less harm to the environment.</p>
            <p>The Erren River used to be one of the most polluted rivers in Taiwan. Many years ago, illegal factories that melted down old metal caused a lot of pollution. In 2000, the government started a special group to deal with this problem. They found and stopped many illegal activities. They also started a plan for rivers and oceans in Taiwan, which helped to create local groups to watch the river and stop new pollution from starting.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau said that after many years of cleaning, the pollution in the Erren River has greatly decreased. In 2002, 100% of the river was heavily polluted, but in 2024, only 21.5% is. However, some parts of the river still have old factory waste and dangerous pollutants that need to be removed. In the future, they will improve how they watch the environment and protect it. This will make the Erren River clean again and bring back plants and animals to its banks.</p>

            <h1>Man Who Drank Wine Daily Thought He Wasn't a Heavy Drinker, But Had Alcoholic Liver Disease and Anemia</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 22 (CNA) Mr. Chen, a man in his 60s, drank a glass of red wine every day. During a health check, doctors found that his red blood cells were too big, and he had anemia (low red blood cells). However, his vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal. It turned out he had alcoholic liver disease. Doctors warn that there is no safe amount of alcohol, and people should not think they are fine just because they don't drink a lot.</p>
            <p>Red blood cells are made with the help of vitamin B12 and folate. Dr. Kang Ben-chu, a doctor specializing in stomach, gut, and liver diseases at Shu-Tien Clinic, said today that folate needs to be changed by the liver to be used when red blood cells are made.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kang explained that for people with alcoholic liver disease, even if they have enough vitamin B12 and folate in their blood, their liver problems can stop them from using the folate correctly. This can cause their red blood cells to become too large, leading to anemia.</p>
            <p>He gave the example of Mr. Chen, who was in his 60s and drank a glass of red wine every day. His family was worried about his liver, so they took him for a health check. The results showed he had large red blood cells and mild anemia. This kind of problem often means someone doesn't have enough vitamin B12 or folate. But further blood tests showed his levels were normal, meaning his gut was absorbing food well, but his liver was already sick.</p>
            <p>"There is no safe amount of alcohol!" Dr. Kang warned. Even if someone doesn't drink a lot, drinking regularly for a long time can harm the liver. He explained that alcohol is processed by the liver, and this process creates a harmful substance called acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde can damage liver cells and cause them to become inflamed, leading to alcoholic liver disease.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kang said that alcoholic liver disease often shows no clear signs at first. It is often found during a health check when blood test results are not normal. People might have anemia with large red blood cells, or their liver function might not be good, or they might have liver inflammation. An ultrasound might show fatty liver or an enlarged liver. If the problem gets worse and turns into liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), it can lead to serious liver problems like hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, which should not be ignored.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kang stressed that the first step to treating alcoholic liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If the problem is still only fatty liver, stopping alcohol, eating healthy, and exercising regularly can help the liver become healthy again. But if it has become cirrhosis, the liver damage cannot be fixed and will not go back to being completely healthy.</p>
