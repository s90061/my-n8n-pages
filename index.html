Many employees are adopting a new approach to work called "quiet quitting." This doesn't mean actually leaving their jobs. Instead, it refers to doing exactly what the job description requires and nothing more. They're still fulfilling their duties, but they are no longer going above and beyond, working late, or volunteering for extra tasks.

This trend is partly fueled by burnout and a desire for better work-life balance. After years of being encouraged to hustle and dedicate themselves completely to their jobs, some workers are now prioritizing their personal lives. They are setting boundaries and focusing on their well-being. Quiet quitting can be a way to reduce stress and reclaim time for hobbies, family, and other activities. Experts say it is important for companies to address the root causes of quiet quitting, such as excessive workloads and lack of recognition, to keep their employees engaged and motivated.

**Article 2: New Museum Celebrates Street Art**

A new museum dedicated entirely to street art has opened in London, offering visitors a look at the history and evolution of this vibrant art form. The museum showcases works by both well-known street artists and emerging talents. It includes murals, graffiti, stencils, and installations, demonstrating the diverse range of styles and techniques within street art.

The aim is to celebrate street art as a legitimate art form and to provide a space for artists to showcase their work to a wider audience. Beyond displaying existing pieces, the museum also commissions new works and hosts workshops where visitors can learn about different street art techniques. The museum hopes to challenge traditional notions of art and to encourage people to see the beauty and creativity that can be found in unexpected places.

**Article 3: Iceland's Tourism Industry Faces Challenges**

Iceland's tourism industry, which has boomed in recent years, is now facing some difficulties. The country's popularity has led to concerns about overtourism, with popular sites becoming crowded and infrastructure struggling to keep up. This has resulted in a negative impact on the environment, with increased pollution and damage to fragile ecosystems.

Furthermore, the rising cost of living in Iceland, partly driven by tourism, is making it difficult for locals. Many Icelanders are struggling to afford housing and other essential goods. The government is now considering measures to manage tourism more sustainably, such as limiting the number of visitors to certain areas and increasing taxes on tourism-related activities. The goal is to preserve Iceland's natural beauty and ensure a better quality of life for its residents.
