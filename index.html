            <h1>Nasdaq Reaches New High, Semiconductor Expo Opens, Taiwan Stocks Aim for More Records</h1>
            <p>American stock markets all went up, and the Nasdaq index reached a new record. TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) increased by 1.55%. Also, the SEMICON Taiwan international semiconductor exhibition started today. Investors hope that TSMC will help Taiwan's stock market reach even higher levels. Experts say that upcoming events, like a defense exhibition and Apple's new phone release, will also help keep the stock market active.</p>
            <p>On September 8, all four main US stock market indexes closed higher. People hope that low US inflation numbers will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 114.09 points (0.25%) to 45514.95 points. The S&P 500 index rose by 13.65 points (0.21%) to 6495.15 points. The Nasdaq index increased by 98.31 points (0.45%) to 21798.70 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 48.21 points (0.84%) to 5809.61 points.</p>
            <p>On September 8, Taiwan's stock market reached 24729.96 points during the day, which was a new intraday high. It closed up by 52.80 points at 24547.38 points, setting a new closing record.</p>
            <p>To meet the growing demand for low-Earth orbit satellites, AST SpaceMobile (ÊòáÈÅîÁßë) plans to make more products. New equipment for its factory in Xizhi, Taiwan, will be ready in October. Its factory in Vietnam will start working 24 hours a day in September. Both factories expect to double their production capacity in the fourth quarter. This will help them deliver many orders in the future.</p>
            <p>The computer brand Acer announced its sales for August. Its total revenue was about NT$21.804 billion, which is 4.5% less than last year. This was mainly due to changes in currency exchange rates. If calculated in US dollars, the revenue actually increased by 2.2%. For the first eight months of this year, total revenue was NT$171.739 billion, down 0.31% from last year. If calculated in US dollars, the revenue increased by 2.7%.</p>
            <p>Adimmune (ÂúãÂÖâÁîüÊäÄ) said that after finishing this year's seasonal flu vaccine production for public health, their production lines are still running because there is a lot of international demand. They are currently testing a second sterile injection filling line for Sanofi, a big vaccine company, which plans to double its production.</p>

            <h1>High Temperatures of 33 to 35 Degrees Expected, Watch Out for Afternoon Thunderstorms</h1>
            <p>The Weather Agency said that today, the weather will be mostly sunny to cloudy across Taiwan. In the afternoon, there will be short thunderstorms in the western part of Taiwan and in the mountains of eastern Taiwan. There is still a chance of heavy rain in some mountain areas. For temperatures, most places will be between 33 and 35 degrees Celsius. Remember to drink a lot of water if you are outside.</p>
            <p>The temperatures across Taiwan will mostly be between 33 and 35 degrees Celsius. However, in the greater Taipei area, central and southern Taiwan, and Hualien, temperatures might go above 36 degrees Celsius in some spots. Please drink plenty of water if you are doing activities outside.</p>
            <p>For the islands, Penghu will be cloudy with short rain, with temperatures between 27 and 32 degrees Celsius. Kinmen will be cloudy with short rain, with temperatures between 27 and 32 degrees Celsius. Matsu will be sunny to cloudy, with temperatures between 27 and 33 degrees Celsius. In the morning, Matsu might have strong winds, with average speeds of level 6 or higher, or gusts of level 8 or higher.</p>
            <p>The Weather Agency also wants to remind people that this is the time of the annual big tides. In coastal areas from Changhua to Chiayi and in Hualien, the water level will be high during high tide. This might cause seawater to flow into land. In low-lying coastal areas, please be careful of drainage problems and local flooding. It is best to avoid staying near the coast, in ports, or in intertidal zones (areas covered by water at high tide and exposed at low tide).</p>
            <p>Also, Typhoon Tapah, which was the 16th tropical storm and located near Guangdong, became a weaker tropical depression last night at 8 PM. It will not affect Taiwan's weather.</p>
            <p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency's air quality forecast, the wind today will blow from the south to southwest. Northern areas are downwind, which means air pollution might build up there more easily. The air quality in Hsinchu-Miaoli, Central, Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan, Kaohsiung-Pingtung, Yilan, Hualien-Taitung areas, and on Matsu, Kinmen, and Penghu islands is expected to be "Good." The air quality in the northern area is expected to be "Normal."</p>

            <h1>Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 Reopens After Safety Concern</h1>
            <p>Tonight, Terminal 4 at Heathrow Airport in the UK was temporarily closed. This was because of a "possible dangerous item incident" in the check-in area. A few hours later, airport officials announced that the terminal was "safe and open again."</p>
            <p>Heathrow Airport wrote on social media: "Emergency services have confirmed that Terminal 4 is safe and can reopen. We are working hard to make sure all flights leave as planned today."</p>
            <p>The London Fire Brigade said that the situation was cleared after about three hours. They had received a call about a "possible dangerous item incident" at the terminal.</p>
            <p>The Fire Brigade also said that medical staff from the London Ambulance Service looked after about 20 people at the airport.</p>
            <p>Heathrow Airport is the main international airport in the UK and a very busy place for flights around the world. Terminal 4 is mostly used for flights to Europe and for long-distance journeys.</p>
            <p>Later, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement that "no signs of any dangerous items were found."</p>
            <p>Even though Terminal 4 was closed for a short time, the other terminals at Heathrow Airport continued to work as normal during the incident.</p>
            <p>The airport added: "We are very sorry for any trouble this caused. The safety of our passengers and our colleagues is our most important goal."</p>
