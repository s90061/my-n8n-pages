            <h1>First Bank: Still Has NT$10 Billion for Home Loans, Focusing on Homes for Personal Use</h1>
            <p>Recently, public banks' home loans have been getting attention. First Bank announced today that it mainly offers home loans for people who need them to live in. They expect home loan growth to be 5% to 6% this year. The total amount of new loans for the year should be about NT$40 billion. They still have NT$10 billion available for loans by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>First Financial Holding Company held a meeting today to talk about its second-quarter results for 2025. They shared their financial numbers and how the company is doing for the first half of the year. Their profit after tax was NT$13.946 billion, which is 1.6% more than last year. This is the highest profit they have ever had for this period. Their earnings per share (EPS) were NT$0.97. First Bank, which is a part of First Financial, had a profit after tax of NT$13.807 billion, which is 7.9% more than last year. This also set a new record for that period. Other companies in the group made a total profit after tax of NT$763 million.</p>
            <p>Cai Shu-hui, the Vice President of First Bank, said that the bank mainly gives loans for homes that people truly need to live in. They expect home loans to grow by 5% to 6% this year. The total new loans for the whole year are aimed to be around NT$40 billion. Each month, they give out about NT$7 billion to NT$8 billion in loans, and it takes about two months to process these loans. For group home loans, these mainly come from social housing and loans for renovating old or dangerous buildings. The total amount of money loaned for land and construction went up by NT$15.6 billion, but regular loans for land and construction went down by about NT$8 billion.</p>
            <p>Looking at the economy for the whole year, Li Shu-ling, the Vice President of First Financial Holding Company, explained that different organizations believe economic growth will slow down in the second half of the year. It might fall below 2.5%, making the total growth for the year around 4.4%. Next year, because this year's numbers are high, economic growth will also slow down. This is because the market needs time to deal with issues about tariffs (taxes on imported goods). There might be a "gap period" of about half a year. It is clear that exports will be affected in the second half of this year.</p>
            <p>Li Shu-ling said that if the tariffs are finally decided, companies should have ways to deal with them. This looks like it will lead to new investments abroad or changes in how assets are managed. This will still create opportunities for the financial industry. She added, "Next year, apart from the housing market which might be slower, the overall economy is not expected to be too bad."</p>
            <p>Li Shu-ling said honestly that Taiwanese companies have managed well during recent economic changes. Some weaker companies might still be affected, but generally, she thinks there is no need to worry too much.</p>
            <p>First Financial Holding Company said that due to higher US tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, and Taiwanese companies moving their supply chains, local industries will face business challenges in the second half of the year. Also, the housing market is slowing down, and previous high numbers mean that bank lending growth is expected to slow. The company will actively help customers deal with these business challenges. At the same time, they will remain strong in their operations. They will take advantage of new business chances, such as the opening of the "Asia Asset Management Center" in Kaohsiung. They will also use their many locations overseas to support Taiwanese companies as they change their production plans, which will create international financial services.</p>
