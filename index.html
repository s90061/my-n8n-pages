            <h1>Air Force: Brave Eagle Jet Lands Safely on Wet Taidong Runway Using Arrestor Wire</h1>
            <p>News reports today said a Brave Eagle advanced jet trainer might have had brake problems and almost went off the runway. The Air Force Command has responded to these reports. They said that a Brave Eagle jet from the Flight Training Department was returning to Taidong Air Base this afternoon after training. The runway was wet. The pilot decided to use the arrestor hook, following the correct steps, to catch the arrestor wire. This helped the plane land safely.</p>
            <p>Media also reported that there was heavy rain in Taidong today. One Brave Eagle jet was thought to have brake failure and almost left the runway. The other jet with it then landed at Tainan Air Base instead. The Air Force Command gave its statement in a news release this evening.</p>
            <p>The Air Force Command stated that during the flight training, there were no problems like the media reported, such as 'brake failure' or 'almost going off the runway' for the Brave Eagle jet. They also said that all flight training follows strict rules and steps to make sure flying is safe.</p>

            <h1>India Plans Dam Water Release, Pakistan Evacuates 150,000 People</h1>
            <p>Officials in Pakistan said today that their country has moved at least 150,000 people from areas near three rivers. These rivers are in Pakistan's main farming region. This happened after India, a neighboring country, warned that it plans to release water from a dam, which could cause floods.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Pakistani officials said they got a sudden warning yesterday from India. India plans to release water from the Madhopur Dam in its Punjab state because the water level there is rising quickly.</p>
            <p>India often releases water from its dams when the water level is too high. This extra water then flows into Pakistan. On August 24, India's government said that because of heavy rain, it had told Pakistan that a lot of water would flow into its rivers.</p>
            <p>The three rivers that flow from India into Pakistan are the Ravi River, the Sutlej River, and the Chenab River.</p>
            <p>Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said today that these rivers currently have moderate to high flood levels.</p>
