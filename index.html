            <h1>Tainan Female Lawyer Arrested for Fraud, Accused of Being Accomplice to Scam Group</h1>
            <p>A female lawyer named Ho from Tainan was involved in a fraud case. She is believed to have helped a scam group. After questioning, the Tainan District Prosecutors Office asked for her to be held. The Tainan District Court decided tonight to keep her in custody. She cannot see visitors or send messages.</p>
            <p>The Tainan District Court said tonight that lawyer Ho is accused of breaking laws about organized crime, fraud, money laundering, and sharing secrets. The court believes she is very likely guilty.</p>
            <p>Also, lawyer Ho worked as a lawyer for both the scam group members and the people who reported the crime. She used her time during police questioning to find out secret information and share it. This helped the scam group. Her actions were very serious. She did not answer questions clearly. There is a worry that she might hide evidence or talk to other people involved or witnesses.</p>

            <h1>Taipower: Hard Work of Employees in Typhoon Repair Should Not Be Called a Photo Op</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 16 (CNA) Taipower says its employees work very hard to fix things after typhoons. They should not be accused of staging photos. Taipower states that the photos taken at repair sites are real records of the work, not staged. Taipower added that the Taiwan Power Company Union has nearly 29,000 members, which is over 99% of its employees. This union represents most employees. The Power Industry Union, however, only has about 100 members.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused great damage in southern Taiwan. The Power Industry Union said today that lower-level employees worked extra hours to fix the typhoon damage. They were also asked to pose for photos while eating. The union claims that high-level government officials used these photos to promote the idea of giving Taipower a lot of money.</p>
            <p>Taipower said in a press release tonight that the repair photos shared with the public were taken randomly by staff at the actual work sites. There were no orders or requests to stage any photos. Sometimes, news reporters would come to the site and ask staff to pose a little for their work.</p>
            <p>Taipower understands and respects that its employees care about their working conditions. This typhoon caused a lot of damage to power lines in the Chiayi-Tainan area, more than ever before. Nearly 3,500 electricity poles fell or broke. More than 10,000 people have worked to fix the damage, and they are still working now.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that the company is very grateful for the hard work of every employee. It will also keep improving benefits for repair workers, such as bonuses, extra paid leave, and danger pay. They hope the public will continue to encourage the frontline repair staff.</p>

            <h1>Israel Bombs Syrian Military Headquarters, Warns Not to Interfere with Druze People</h1>
            <p>Sweida, Syria, July 16 (CNA) Israel bombed Syria's military headquarters in Damascus today. This happened after Israel warned the Syrian government, led by Islamists, not to bother the Druze minority group in their main area, Sweida province.</p>
            <p>An organization that watches conflicts said that nearly 250 people have died in fights between different groups in Sweida province, in southern Syria.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that more than 100 people died in fighting between the Druze people and local Bedouin tribes. Yesterday, Syrian government troops entered Sweida city, where most people are Druze. They said they were there to watch over a ceasefire agreement made with Druze leaders.</p>
            <p>However, witnesses said that the government troops and Bedouin people worked together to attack Druze fighters and regular people. They killed many people in the city.</p>
            <p>In April and May, government troops and Druze fighters also fought in Sweida province and near Damascus. More than 100 people died then. This new conflict is the worst violence since that time.</p>
            <p>Since December of last year, when they removed the old president Bashar al-Assad, the Islamist-led government in Syria has had problems with religious and ethnic minority groups.</p>
            <p>Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, told the Damascus government to "not interfere with the Druze people in Sweida province."</p>
            <p>He asked the Syrian army to leave. He promised that the Israeli army would not stop its attacks until they leave. Katz stressed that if this message is not understood, Israel will "increase its response against the Syrian government."</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Israeli army said it had attacked the Syrian military headquarters.</p>
