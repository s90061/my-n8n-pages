            <h1>Sichuan Bullying Case Makes Many People Angry, Large Protests Happen, Many Arrested</h1>
            <p>In Jiangyou, Sichuan, China, a bullying event involving young people happened recently. Videos shared online show the bullies acting very proud. They said, "We've been to the police station more than 10 times, and we get out in less than 20 minutes." This made many people very angry. Local people were unhappy that the police did not handle the case strictly enough. Last night, many people protested. The police used force to make people leave, and many people were arrested.</p>
            <p>According to videos online and reports from Chinese media, on July 22, a 14-year-old student named Lai and a 15-year-old student named Liu had a disagreement. Liu and two other people took Lai to an old, empty building. They used bad words to her, threatened her, and hit her. This included taking off her clothes, hitting her face many times, and making her kneel down and kicking her hard. When Lai said her father would call the police, one of the bullies said proudly, "Do you think we are scared of you? We've been there before." Another bully said, "We've been to the police station more than 10 times, and we get out in less than 20 minutes."</p>
            <p>The videos started to spread online on August 2nd, and this made many people very angry. On August 4th, the Jiangyou City Public Security Bureau announced that Lai only had minor injuries. They said that the three people involved would go to special schools for help or receive strong warnings. Many people were unhappy that the police handled the situation so lightly. They gathered outside the Jiangyou city government to protest. They asked for stronger punishment for the people who did the bullying and stood against the police.</p>
            <p>According to many videos posted by the account "Mr. Li Is Not Your Teacher" on the X platform, police started arresting protesters on the afternoon of August 4th. Some were even put into trucks normally used for pigs and taken away. Even though the police blocked the road in front of the city government, people still gathered to protest until late at night. They sang the national anthem and shouted slogans at the police. In the middle of the night, the police suddenly started to clear the area. They violently arrested citizens, and there was fighting with blood. This continued until 3 AM on August 5th.</p>

            <h1>NONO Accused of Two Sexual Assault Crimes, Case Sent Back for More Investigation, Prosecutors File New Charges</h1>
            <p>The entertainer NONO (Chen Hsuan-yu) was accused of attempted forced sexual acts. A court first sentenced him to 2 years and 6 months in prison. This case is now being heard by a second court. In addition, he was also accused of forced indecent assault and forced sexual acts. The High Prosecutors' Office sent these parts of the case back twice for more investigation. Today, the Shilin District Prosecutors' Office officially charged him again.</p>
            <p>The whole case began in 2023 when a woman accused NONO on Facebook of hurting her. After that, many other women also made accusations.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office investigated the accusations of three other people who said NONO forced indecent acts and sexual acts on them. The office decided there was not enough proof and did not charge him. Two of the three people who made accusations were not happy with this decision. They asked the Taiwan High Prosecutors' Office to review the case again. The High Prosecutors' Office sent the case back to the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office for more investigation. Because of a problem with which court had power over the case, the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office asked the High Prosecutors' Office to send the case to the Shilin District Prosecutors' Office to handle.</p>
            <p>The Shilin District Prosecutors' Office still decided there was not enough proof and did not charge him. The people who made accusations asked the High Prosecutors' Office again to review the case. The High Prosecutors' Office sent the case back to the Shilin District Prosecutors' Office for more investigation a second time. After several months of investigation, the Shilin District Prosecutors' Office officially charged him again today.</p>
