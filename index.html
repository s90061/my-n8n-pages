**Taiwanese Temple Culture to be Showcased at Osaka Expo**

Taiwanese "é…¬ç¥žæˆ²" (plays performed to thank gods) will be shown at the Osaka-Kansai Expo in August. This was announced by Minister of Culture Li Yuan at a press conference today. The show, called "Sounds of the Island â€“ Temple Plays," has been invited to be part of the expo's official program.

Minister Li Yuan expressed his emotion about this opportunity, saying that it is difficult for Taiwan to participate in such events because it does not have formal diplomatic relations with Japan, but their friendship is very strong. The temple plays will be performed for three days at the Osaka Expo Plaza.

"Sounds of the Island â€“ Temple Plays" will have a one-hour performance each day for three days. The show is put together by director Du Sih-huei and music director Cho Shih-yao. It includes nine groups who will show how Taiwanese people thank the gods. Some of the groups are Sin Sheng Jing Hand Puppet Theater, Boom Boom Sound Studio, P.C. Art Crew, singer Sangpuy, Hsieh Ming-you, Hope Children's Choir, and Wen-Shiang Dance Company.

**China's Exports Grew by 7.2% in June**

China's customs reported today that in June, the total value of imports and exports increased by 5.2% compared to last year. Exports grew by 7.2%, and imports grew by 2.3%. For the first half of this year, the total value of imports and exports increased by 2.9%.

This information was shared at a press conference by China's State Council Information Office this morning, where they discussed China's import and export situation for the first half of the year.

The latest data from China's customs shows that for the first half of this year, China's total imports and exports grew by 2.9%. Exports increased by 7.2%, but imports decreased by 2.7%. In June alone, imports and exports grew by 5.2%, with exports up by 7.2% and imports up by 2.3%.

Looking at other data, in the first half of the year, private companies' imports and exports increased by 7.3%, making up 57.3% of total foreign trade, which is 2.3 percentage points higher than the same period last year. Foreign-funded companies' imports and exports grew by 2.4%, continuing to grow for five quarters in a row.

In the first half of this year, China's imports and exports with the European Union increased by 3.5%. Trade with other BRICS countries and partners increased by 3.9%, accounting for 28.1% of China's total imports and exports. Trade with countries involved in the "Belt and Road" initiative increased by 4.7%, making up 51.8% of total foreign trade.

Wang Lingjun, Deputy Director of China's General Administration of Customs, stated that China is expanding its "circle of friends" to deal with one-sided trade actions and protectionism. While trade with traditional markets like the EU, Japan, and the UK has grown, new markets are contributing more. In the first half of this year, trade with Africa increased by 14.4%, and with Central Asia by 13.8%.

Wang Lingjun also said that some countries' actions, like unfair tariffs, go against international trade rules and create big challenges for the global economy. Despite these problems, China is confident and able to handle these risks because it has diverse and stable markets, innovative and high-quality products, and flexible foreign trade businesses.

Lu Daliang, spokesperson and director of the Department of Statistics and Analysis at China's General Administration of Customs, explained that the decrease in imports in the first half of the year was due to various reasons, including uncertain international trade policies and falling prices of raw materials.

Lu Daliang noted that raw materials make up about 30% of China's total imports, and their price changes have a big impact. In the first half of this year, the average import prices of crude oil, iron ore, and soybeans all dropped by more than 10%, which slowed down the overall import growth.
