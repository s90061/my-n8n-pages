            <h1>Canada Official Says Trump and Carney Might Talk Soon</h1>
            <p>After the US said it would make taxes on all Canadian goods not covered by the "USMCA trade agreement" higher, up to 35%, a Canadian official said today that US President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Carney might talk "in the next few days."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Dominic LeBlanc, the minister in charge of trade between the US and Canada, also told the CBS news show "Face the Nation" that he felt hopeful because of recent talks. He believes that reaching an agreement to lower these taxes is still possible.</p>
            <p>LeBlanc said, "We are hopeful because of our talks with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. But we need to make a deal that is best for both economies, and we haven't done that yet."</p>
            <p>He said that he expects Prime Minister Carney and President Trump to talk "in the next few days."</p>
            <p>LeBlanc added, "We believe that making a deal to lower some of these taxes and give more certainty for investing is possible."</p>
            <p>When Washington announced the taxes on Canada, one reason given was that Canada had not stopped the smuggling of a strong pain medicine called fentanyl.</p>

            <h1>US Trade Representative Says New Taxes on Goods Are Almost Final</h1>
            <p>In an interview shown today, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said that the new tax rates on goods for the US "are mostly decided." He said there is little chance for immediate talks about them. He also defended President Trump's taxes on Brazil, saying they were for political reasons.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Trump uses taxes on goods to show the US's economic strength. He has set taxes from 10% to 41% on many countries, including the European Union. These new taxes will start on August 7th.</p>
            <p>Greer said in a recorded interview on CBS's "Face the Nation" that it is unlikely these tax rates will change "in the next few days."</p>
            <p>He said, "Many of these tax rates are set by agreements. Some agreements have been announced, some have not. Others depend on how much trade we have with that country, whether we buy more or sell more."</p>
            <p>"These tax rates on goods are mostly set."</p>
            <p>He also said that it is clear some trade ministers "want to talk more to see how they can work with the US in different ways." But he added, "from these tax rates, we can now really see what the President's plan for taxes looks like."</p>
            <p>On July 31st, Trump announced the new tax rates on goods for many trading partners. These will start on August 7th.</p>
            <p>For Brazil, the largest economy in South America, the tax rate was greatly increased. Goods from Brazil sent to the US will face a 50% tax. However, a long list of important products like airplanes and orange juice are not included.</p>
            <p>Trump openly said that he was punishing Brazil because his political friend, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, was charged with a crime. Trump called Bolsonaro's case a "witch hunt."</p>
            <p>Greer said it is not unusual for Trump to use taxes on goods as a tool for political goals.</p>
            <p>At the same time, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said that talks with some US trade partners might continue next week. But he agreed with Greer about the taxes, saying that most rates "are more or less fixed."</p>
            <p>On NBC News's "Meet the Press," host Kristen Welker asked Hassett if Trump might change the tax rates if financial markets react badly.</p>
            <p>Hassett replied, "I would say no to that possibility, because these are final agreements."</p>

            <h1>Southwest Wind Brings Heavy Rain Warning for Kaohsiung and Pingtung Mountains</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration has given a special warning for heavy rain. Because of the southwest wind, there will likely be short periods of strong rain. Today, the mountain areas of Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County will have local heavy rain or very heavy rain. There is also a chance of local heavy rain in Penghu, Kinmen, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and the mountain areas from Nantou to Tainan.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration reminds people to be careful of lightning and strong winds. In low areas, watch out for standing water and floods. Because it has been raining for many days, mountain areas should be careful of loose soil, landslides, rockfalls, and mudslides. People should avoid going to mountain areas.</p>
