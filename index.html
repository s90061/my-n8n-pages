            <h1>Taiwan's Drones: Exports Grow Seven Times with 'Non-Red' Supply Chain Focus</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 27, Central News Agency reporter Liu Chien-ling) Taiwan's national drone team is doing well in the market by focusing on supply chains that are not from China. According to customs data, from January to June this year, the value of drone exports was 11.89 million US dollars (about 350 million New Taiwan Dollars). This is 7.49 times more than the same time last year. Poland was the biggest buyer. The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) says that because of global political changes, Taiwan's drone industry is a new choice for European buyers. This is due to Taiwan's strong information and communication technology, flexible production, and democratic background.</p>
            <p>Also, the government has looked at the drone needs of different ministries for the next four years. They will need about 50,000 drones. This will help the national drone team sell more products within Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Customs export data shows that in the first half of this year, Taiwan's drone exports reached 11.89 million US dollars. This is a big increase of 749% compared to the same period last year. The top five countries for exports were Poland, the United States, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong. These five markets made up 97% of all exports.</p>
            <p>In the first half of this year, drone exports to Poland were 6.48 million US dollars, which is 54% of all exports. This is much higher than other areas. Since December last year, the amount of complete drones Taiwan exported to Europe has grown a lot. This shows that Taiwanese companies are slowly entering the European market.</p>
            <p>Exports to the United States were 1.549 million US dollars, making it the second-largest market. This was a 209% increase from last year. Germany was third with 1.458 million US dollars, a 258 times increase from last year. Also, in past years, Taiwan did not export drones to the Czech Republic. But recent customs data shows that the Czech Republic became Taiwan's fourth-largest drone export market in the first half of this year. Hong Kong was fifth.</p>
            <p>TAITRA stated that with changes in global supply chains and political situations, Europe cares more about military safety, cybersecurity, and important technologies. Since the war between Ukraine and Russia and the growing problems in the Middle East, the European Union has been actively trying to reduce its reliance on Chinese supply chains and promote democratic ones. Taiwan's drone industry has become a new option for European buyers who are actively looking to work with Taiwan. This is because of Taiwan's strong information and communication technology, flexible production, and democratic values.</p>
            <p>The demand for drones in Europe continues to grow. TAITRA explained that drones are used for military purposes like border security, watching over land, and defending against other drones. They are also used for daily life, such as spraying crops in agriculture, checking infrastructure, and monitoring cities. European companies and governments are actively looking for reliable partners. This is the best time for Taiwanese companies to enter the European market.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Ministry of National Defense recently announced plans for large-scale bids for military-grade drones that are also for commercial use. To make the local drone market bigger, the government has also listed the drone needs for different ministries over the next four years. These include needs from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Economic Affairs, totaling about 50,000 drones. After the Executive Yuan approves the plan, each ministry will set aside money to buy them.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Drone International Business Alliance started in September last year. Since then, it has promoted sales in Europe, Japan, and other countries. People in the industry say that the export numbers from the first half of this year show how strong the national drone team is when they work together overseas. Even though China still has a price advantage for commercial drones, Taiwanese companies can actively enter the drone markets in Europe and America. This is due to the trend of using 'non-Red' supply chains and focusing on cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Industry experts pointed out that the Taiwan Drone Alliance includes companies that make complete drones, parts, batteries, and ground equipment. They can combine these parts well and quickly meet buying and delivery needs. Also, Taiwanese companies are excellent in making important parts like semiconductors, chips, communication parts, and modules. This helps them support many different uses and new designs.</p>

            <h1>Clinic Sign Falls in Taichung, Hits 6 Motorcycles, No One Hurt</h1>
            <p>(Taichung, July 27, Central News Agency reporter Chao Li-li) In Taiping District, Taichung City, a Chinese medicine clinic on Zhongxing Road had its sign fall down on July 26. The sign fell for an unknown reason and damaged six motorcycles below it. Luckily, no one was walking by, so no one was hurt. The clinic owners have contacted the motorcycle owners to discuss how to pay for the damage.</p>
            <p>The Taiping Police Department in Taichung City explained today in a written statement that at 1:47 PM on July 26, the sign of a Chinese medicine clinic on Zhongxing Road in Taiping District fell down for an unknown reason. It hit six motorcycles below, causing different levels of damage to the motorcycles. No one was in the area, so no one got hurt.</p>
            <p>Initial guesses suggest that the sign was old and its screws were loose, which caused it to fall. The clinic owners have already contacted the motorcycle owners to help with paying for the damage.</p>
