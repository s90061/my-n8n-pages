**US Tariff Deadline Nears: Some Countries May Get More Time**

The deadline for new tariffs set by US President Trump is coming soon, on July 9th. A White House official, Stephen Miran, said today that countries that are talking with the US and are willing to make changes might get more time before the tariffs start. However, countries that are not cooperating might have to pay higher tariffs.

So far, the US has reached agreements with the UK, China, and Vietnam. The US and Vietnamese agreement is good for America, as the US will put taxes on goods from Vietnam, but Vietnam will not tax goods from the US. President Trump will make final decisions later this week.

**World No. 1 Sabalenka Moves to Wimbledon Quarterfinals**

Aryna Sabalenka, the world's best female tennis player from Belarus, won her match today easily. She beat Elise Mertens from Belgium in two sets without losing any. She is now in the quarterfinals of the Wimbledon tennis tournament.

Sabalenka, who is 27 years old, has never reached the final at Wimbledon. She could not play last year because of an injury. In 2022, she was not allowed to play because of the war in Ukraine. Sabalenka won today with scores of 6-4, 7-6 (7/4). She will play against Laura Siegemund from Germany in the quarterfinals on July 8th.
