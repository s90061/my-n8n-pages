            <h1>Japanese Media: Apple's Foldable iPhone to Have Test Production in Taiwan, Mass Production in India in 2026</h1>
            <p>Nikkei Asia reported today that Apple has talked with its suppliers about making a test version of a foldable iPhone in Taiwan. The company plans to start making many of these new phones in India in 2026 and then sell them.</p>
            <p>Sources say that Apple, a big American technology company, wants to send out 10% more phones in 2026. They believe that releasing the new foldable phone, which many people are waiting for, will help them reach this goal.</p>
            <p>Three people who know about this said that the idea is to use the engineering skills and resources of Apple's suppliers in Taiwan. They want to set up a small test production line. This line will help them make the production machines better, change settings, and improve the steps for making the foldable iPhone. Once they find the best way to make the phone, they will use the same method to make many phones in India.</p>
            <p>If this plan works, it will help Apple move its new product development away from China. This is important because the relationship between the US and China is still difficult.</p>
            <p>Two of the sources said that Apple's suppliers have looked for a place in a city in northern Taiwan. This place would be for setting up the test production line. However, these plans are not final and could still change.</p>
            <p>They also said that Taiwan has limits on land and workers. Even for a test production line, they would need thousands of workers. This is a challenge.</p>
            <p>People who know about the situation told Nikkei Asia that Apple has told many of its suppliers that the new foldable iPhone will make more people want all iPhones, including regular ones. Making sure the new phone starts production smoothly is very important for Apple to reach its goals next year.</p>
            <p>Sources said that Apple plans to release a new generation of iPhones in 2026. They aim to make about 95 million units, which is more than a 10% increase from this year.</p>
            <p>Sources also said that Apple's plan to produce in Taiwan and India could help reduce problems from the difficult relationships between the US and China, and China and India. It could also help with shipping challenges.</p>

            <h1>Typhoons Mita, Hagasawa Expected to Form; Hagasawa Estimated to Be a Medium Typhoon or Stronger</h1>
            <p>Two tropical depressions, numbers 20 and 21, might become typhoons today. They will be named Typhoon Mita and Typhoon Hagasawa. Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that computer models show Hagasawa will get stronger, becoming a medium typhoon or more. It will bring strong winds and heavy rain. People in eastern Taiwan should prepare for a lot of rain on September 23rd and 24th.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration has warned about high temperatures. This is because of the tropical depression or the air moving down from the edge of a typhoon. The weather will be very hot. Today, New Taipei City has a red warning, meaning there is a chance of temperatures reaching 38 degrees Celsius for a long time. Taipei City, Taichung City, and Changhua County have an orange warning, meaning temperatures could reach 36 degrees Celsius for a long time. Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, and Yunlin County have a yellow warning, telling people to be careful of temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Associate Professor Wu Der-rong from National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences wrote in his "Sky Disclosure Classroom" column for the Meteorological Applications Promotion Foundation. He said that the latest weather agency's path prediction map shows a tropical depression moving into the western side of the Bashi Channel today. It will soon become a light typhoon named Mita. It will move towards the Pearl River estuary and then turn west. The moisture around it will cause more rain from today until September 20th.</p>
            <p>Another tropical depression might also become Typhoon Hagasawa today. Wu Der-rong stated that the newest European weather model for 8 PM on September 22nd shows Typhoon Hagasawa entering the Bashi Channel and moving west. The latest American model has also changed to be similar to the European one. It predicts that Hagasawa will get stronger, becoming a "medium" typhoon or more, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. However, he stressed that this is just a computer prediction for about a week from now. The typhoon's exact path is still uncertain, and whether it will cause more danger is something to keep watching closely.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the European model shows that from today until September 20th, there will be more moisture from the big low-pressure system and the edge of light Typhoon Mita. This will bring some rain to eastern and Gaoping areas. In the afternoon, there will be scattered short showers or thunderstorms, and these will spread further north each day. There is also a chance of heavy thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>He said that for today and tomorrow, northern Taiwan will still have very high temperatures of about 38 degrees Celsius. Other areas will see a small drop in temperature, but it will still be quite hot.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also pointed out that the latest European model shows a bit less moisture on September 21st. It will be sunny and very hot everywhere, with some short showers or thunderstorms in the mountains in the afternoon. On September 22nd, Hagasawa's outer parts will be close. Taipei and Yilan/Hualien will get rain. Even though there is no cold air, the high temperatures will drop a little because of the rain. Other areas will still be warm.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that on September 23rd and 24th, Typhoon Hagasawa will pass through the Bashi Channel and go into the South China Sea. Eastern Taiwan should prepare for a lot of rain. How much other areas are affected will depend on how close they are to the typhoon. We need to keep watching.</p>

            <h1>International Cooperation Improves: NCSIST to Sign Contracts with 6 Big Defense Companies</h1>
            <p>The defense exhibition starts today. The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) will sign contracts with six international companies. These companies are Anduril, Airshare, Leonardo DRS, AeroVironment, MARTAC, and Northrop Grumman. The contracts are for things like upgrading M60A3 tanks, unmanned vehicles, and the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS).</p>
            <p>The Taiwan International Aerospace & Defense Industry Exhibition happens every two years. It will take place from today until September 20th at the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center. The main topics are "Advanced Defense, Sustainable Flight, Resilient Supply Chain, and Unmanned Future." More than 400 companies from 14 countries are taking part. This is the biggest exhibition ever.</p>
            <p>The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) is also showing many new types of equipment at the Defense Pavilion. This pavilion includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, National Defense University, and the Armaments Bureau. The equipment includes low-cost self-flying missiles (loitering munitions) developed with the American company Anduril. There are also four types of "Jingfeng" drones, "Kuaqi" unmanned boats, "Ruiyuan II" drones, and the "Strong Bow" (Tien Kung IV) missile system. These show Taiwan's ability to develop its own defense technology.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that NCSIST President Lee Shih-chiang and his teams will sign contracts and MOUs with the six international companies this afternoon. These companies are Anduril, Airshare, Leonardo DRS, AeroVironment, MARTAC, and Northrop Grumman.</p>
            <p>For Anduril, besides the low-cost self-flying missiles (loitering munitions) they are already working on, they will also work with NCSIST's "Shenlong Project" team. They will develop Anduril's "Dive-LD," which is a multi-purpose unmanned underwater vehicle. This is the first time Taiwan will use a self-navigating underwater vehicle. It can search underwater for up to 10 days. It can also map the seabed, check the environment, inspect underwater buildings, and help stop smuggling.</p>
            <p>For Airshare, they will work with NCSIST's Electronics Institute. The project is about the "Interceptor UX" ribbon rocket, and making radars, optical-electronic systems, and jammers better. The goal is to combine the ribbon rocket with existing ways to stop threats. This will help get rid of drone threats in the cheapest way, protecting strike forces and important buildings.</p>
            <p>For Leonardo DRS, they will work with NCSIST's Material and Electro-Optical Systems Institute. The project is about selling upgrade kits for the M60A3 tank's "firing, gun control, and viewing systems." The goal is for NCSIST to make these parts and DRS to sell them.</p>
            <p>For AeroVironment, they will work with NCSIST's Aeronautical Systems Research Division. The project is for unmanned aircraft systems that can be used by both the military and civilians. In the future, they will work together to develop drones by "combining their technologies and strengths." Both sides plan to create a long-term way of working together. This includes sharing technology and building up support and maintenance abilities. These will be used for field-level maintenance of the Coast Guard's Jump-20X and for Navy reconnaissance drones.</p>
            <p>For MARTAC, they will work with NCSIST's "Shenlong Project" team. The project is about unmanned boats. They will work together to develop technologies like AI (artificial intelligence) for finding and tracking targets, stopping things automatically, setting up protection barriers, having many boats work together, avoiding objects on the sea, stopping things with force, and making smart decisions for tactics.</p>
            <p>For Northrop Grumman, they will work with NCSIST's Military Communication Center. The project is about the "Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS)." They will together look into and promote how NCSIST-made anti-missiles and American-made missiles can work together within the IBCS system. They will also look at how this can be done in the future.</p>
