            <h1>"Japanese First" Slogan Helps Party Win Many Votes in Election</h1>
            <p>The "Sanseit≈ç" party, a far-right group in Japan, was one of the biggest winners in the Upper House election today. They warned about immigrants entering quietly and promised lower taxes and more money for social help. These ideas helped them get support.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that Sanseit≈ç started on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic. They shared ideas about vaccines and powerful global groups. They became popular in politics with their message of "Japanese first."</p>
            <p>Three years ago, Sanseit≈ç only had 1 seat out of 248 in the Upper House. NHK, a Japanese TV channel, thinks the party will win many more seats this time, perhaps between 10 and 22.</p>
            <p>Mr. Soshio Kamiya, 47, is the leader of Sanseit≈ç. After the election, he told NTV, "The idea of 'Japanese first' means we want to make life better for Japanese people by stopping global ways. I am not saying we should stop all foreigners from coming, and I am not saying all foreigners should leave Japan."</p>
            <p>Political experts say Kamiya's message spoke to what many voters felt. The economy was not good, which already made people unhappy. In recent years, the Japanese currency became weak, which brought many tourists. This made prices even higher for Japanese people, who already found things expensive.</p>
            <p>Japan's population is getting old quickly. Last year, about 3.8 million foreigners lived in Japan. This was the highest number ever. Even though this is only 3% of Japan's total population, which is small compared to countries like the US or Europe, it was still a new record.</p>
            <p>Kamiya used to be a supermarket manager and an English teacher. Before the election, he told Reuters that he was inspired by the "bold political style" of US President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>People have also compared him to parties like AfD in Germany and Reform UK in Britain. But in Japan, right-wing populist ideas are not yet as strong as they are in Europe and America.</p>
            <p>Kamiya said that after the election, he plans to work with other small parties. He will not work with the LDP government, which has been in power for most of Japan's history after the war. This is similar to how new populist parties in Europe act.</p>
            <p>Japanese politics has already moved more to the right because Sanseit≈ç talks a lot about immigration. Not long before the election, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government announced a new office. This office will work to stop "crime and bad behavior" by foreigners. His party also promised to have "zero illegal foreigners."</p>
            <p>Sanseit≈ç is like other opposition parties because they also want lower taxes and more money for children's help. These plans make investors worried about Japan's money situation and its big debt. However, Sanseit≈ç is different from other opposition parties because they have a bigger presence online. They use the internet to criticize Japan's main political groups.</p>
            <p>Kamiya said that Sanseit≈ç's success in the Upper House is only the beginning.</p>
            <p>He said, "We are slowly increasing our numbers, and we will not disappoint the people. By building a strong group and making sure we get 50 or 60 seats, I truly believe our plans will finally happen."</p>

            <h1>73 Palestinians Die, Many Hurt as Israeli Army Fires at People Needing Aid</h1>
            <p>The Gaza Civil Defense said that Israeli soldiers fired at Palestinians who were trying to get help today. This happened in the Gaza Strip, a place badly affected by war. Because of this, 73 people died and many were hurt.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency said that at least 67 people died when trucks carrying aid arrived in northern Gaza. Also, 6 other people died in the past 24 hours near an aid point in Rafah, in southern Gaza.</p>
            <p>The UN World Food Programme said that their group of 25 trucks carrying food crossed from Israel. Soon after passing a checkpoint, they "met many hungry civilians who were shot" near Gaza City.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army questioned the number of dead. They said thousands of people gathered in Gaza City. The soldiers fired warning shots because they "faced an immediate danger."</p>
            <p>It has become common in Gaza for civilians to die while trying to get aid. The local government in Gaza says the Israeli army fires at large groups of people going to aid centers. This happens because there is little food and other important things for a long time.</p>
            <p>The United Nations said earlier this month that almost 800 people looking for aid have died since late May. This number includes people who died along the paths where aid convoys travel.</p>

            <h1>China's Influence to Grow as Western Countries Cut Aid to Southeast Asia, Says Australian Think Tank</h1>
            <p>An Australian think tank called the Lowy Institute released a study today. It says that China will become more powerful in helping Southeast Asian countries develop. This will happen because the government of US President Trump and other Western countries are giving much less aid.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that the Lowy Institute in Sydney said Southeast Asia is in "difficult times." This is because Western countries are giving less money for development. Also, the US has "very harsh" taxes on goods, which makes the situation harder.</p>
            <p>The Lowy Institute also said, "If Western aid becomes less, China might get a bigger role. But other Asian countries that give money will also become more important."</p>
            <p>According to this yearly report from the Lowy Institute, the total money for official development that Southeast Asia got in 2023 went up "a little" to 29 billion US dollars. But since then, Trump has stopped about 60 billion US dollars in development aid. Most of this was part of US programs for help in other countries.</p>
            <p>The report said that seven European countries, including France and Germany, and the European Union, have said they will cut 17.2 billion US dollars in aid that was planned for 2025 to 2029. The UK also said it will reduce its yearly aid by 7.6 billion US dollars. This money will be used for defense instead.</p>
            <p>This study predicts that by 2026, the total official development money for Southeast Asia will go down by more than 2 billion US dollars, based on recent announcements. "These cuts will hurt Southeast Asia a lot," the study said.</p>
            <p>The study said, "It seems that the main focus of development money in Southeast Asia will move to the East, especially to Beijing. But Tokyo and Seoul will also play a part."</p>
            <p>"As Western help for development goes down, China will become more important as a helper in this region," the study added.</p>
            <p>The report showed that in 2023, Beijing increased its development money to Southeast Asia by 1.6 billion US dollars, reaching 4.9 billion US dollars. Most of this money was for big building projects like railway lines in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
            <p>At the same time, China's promises for building projects in Southeast Asia grew four times, to almost 10 billion US dollars. This was mainly because a big port project in Myanmar called Kyaukphyu Deep Sea Port started again.</p>
