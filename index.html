Jensen Huang, the head of the chip company NVIDIA, said that American technology companies can get through President Trump's tariff plans. He believes they will manage, just like they have managed other difficult times before. He also said it's very important for the US to make more computer chips.

Huang talked to USA Today and said that nobody likes sudden changes in business, but he believes President Trump will sort out trade deals. He thinks countries will adjust, and businesses will overcome these problems. NVIDIA recently became the first company to be worth $4 trillion on the stock market, passing Apple and Microsoft.

Huang's company is in the middle of trade talks between Trump and countries like China. If Trump puts more taxes on imported chips, it could affect companies that make them. But Huang is not worried. He said that rules, taxes, and tariffs have always existed, and companies have always found a way to work through them. He believes companies will handle this situation too.

Huang met with President Trump and also with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Huang said he "definitely" thinks the US must make more semiconductors. He believes Trump's idea to make more things in the US is good for the industry and for society. Trump also told Huang he was proud of NVIDIA's high value.

They also talked about how to help US tech companies stay strong as everyone moves towards AI. They discussed bringing high-tech manufacturing back to the US. Huang said NVIDIA is building special computers in Texas and putting chip parts together in Arizona.

**Trump's Plan Works: US Earns Over $100 Billion from Tariffs This Year**

A new report from the US government shows that the country has collected over $100 billion from tariffs for the first time in one financial year. This happened because President Trump made tariffs bigger. In June, the money from tariffs went up a lot again.

The report said that in June, the US got $27.2 billion from tariffs. This is four times more than the same time last year. Because of this, the government had $27 billion more money than it expected in June. President Trump thinks tariffs are a good way to make money for the government and to help with foreign policy.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that these results show President Trump's tariff plans are working well. He also said that the money from tariffs is going up without causing prices to rise too much. From October to June, the US collected a total of $113.3 billion from tariffs, which is almost double what it collected last year. The US financial year ends on September 30.

Now, tariffs are the fourth biggest way the government gets money. They are behind money from people's paychecks, other taxes from individuals, and taxes from companies.

**Writer's Partner Attacked While Supporting Recall, Woman Involved Must Stay Home**

Lai Ting-ho, who is the partner of writer Yang Shuang-tzu, was attacked yesterday evening. She was promoting a recall (when people vote to remove someone from office) when a woman attacked her. The police have sent the woman, whose last name is Su, to the prosecutor's office. The prosecutor has told Ms. Su that she must stay at home.

Yang Shuang-tzu wrote on Facebook that her partner, Lai Ting-ho, has been helping with the recall campaign for about six months. She knew that volunteers might face attacks. However, the attack yesterday by an older woman still shocked Lai Ting-ho a lot.

Yang Shuang-tzu said that this attack was more serious than she expected. Six volunteers, including Lai Ting-ho, were on the street corner at the time, and two police officers were also there. But the attack happened so fast that no one could stop it in time.

The police in New Taipei City said that the fight happened around 5 PM yesterday. A 73-year-old woman, Ms. Su, yelled at Lai Ting-ho and tried to grab her phone. Ms. Su hit Lai Ting-ho's lower jaw and right hand and also grabbed her wrist, causing injuries and making Lai Ting-ho scared. The police stopped Ms. Su and took her to the police station. She is charged with assault, forcing someone to do something, threats, public insult, and breaking election laws. The New Taipei District Prosecutor's Office said today that Ms. Su must stay at home after questioning.
