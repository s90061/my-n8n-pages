            <h1>Lu Chia-hui Wins Gold at MUSE Design Awards for Taiwan Women's Power Night in New York</h1>
            <p>Lu Chia-hui, who is the head of the Egret Culture and Education Foundation, designed and put on a show for the "Taiwan Gender Equality Week â€“ Night of Women's Power: Celebrating Women's Strength and Progress." This event was held this year at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York. She was asked to do this by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Foundation for Women's Rights Promotion and Development. For her work, she won a gold award at the American MUSE Design Awards.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York held a "Taiwan Women's Cultural Night" and a "Taiwan Women's Power Exhibition" on March 12. This public event was part of their support for the theme of the 69th United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW 69).</p>
            <p>Lu Chia-hui, who is also a piano player, performed a multimedia piano show that day. Its themes were "Towards the Sun" and "Orchids." Through this, she showed the values of peace, love, and hope. She used piano music, projected lights, and images to combine new technology with art. She also used special Taiwanese flowers and symbols to show the strong female spirit of "flexible leadership and great change."</p>
            <p>The show that Lu Chia-hui designed and put on won a gold award in the "Conceptual Design - Exhibition & Events" category at the 2025 MUSE Design Awards. This was announced on August 28, Eastern US time.</p>
            <p>The main idea for Taiwan Gender Equality Week in 2025 was "Taiwan's Home Ground." It started with strong, natural colors: red for courage, green for growth, and gold for success. The main symbol was a "butterfly," which stands for Taiwan and the changing journey of women.</p>
            <p>The Egret Foundation said that Lu Chia-hui's "Hope" multimedia show made the stage come alive. It used new, real-time technology to combine live piano music with unreal art images of special Taiwanese plants and animals. This mixed music, art, technology, and hope perfectly. The two original video works, "Towards the Sun" and "Orchids," let the guests enjoy a show that used many senses.</p>

            <h1>Bus Doors Often Catch People, Taipei Public Transport Office Asks for Safer Procedures</h1>
            <p>A person riding bus 265 got caught by the bus door. The driver stopped and opened the door only after other passengers told him. A city council member said that people getting caught by bus doors happens often. Today, the Taipei Public Transport Office said it will tell bus companies to make sure drivers follow all safety rules.</p>
            <p>Yu Shu-hui, a Taipei City Council member from the KMT party, said that someone complained to her. A person was riding the last bus 265 one day. The driver might not have seen that the passenger wanted to get off. He quickly closed the door and drove forward. This caused the passenger to get caught and stuck in the middle of the door. The driver only stopped and opened the door when other passengers told him to.</p>
            <p>She said that people have reported that bus 265 is often crowded during rush hours, when many people ride it. Passengers often stand near the front and back doors. Some drivers often close the door before all passengers have gotten off. This causes sudden stops and people getting caught by the doors to happen a lot.</p>
            <p>She looked at data and found that bus companies reported these accidents themselves. In 2023, there were 46 cases of passengers getting caught by doors. Last year, there were 25 cases. From January to June this year, there have been 13 cases already. She believes there are countless other times when people were caught but not hurt.</p>
            <p>Yu Shu-hui wants the Public Transport Office to send a letter to all bus companies. Especially for companies that run routes where people often get caught, they should tell drivers to pay attention before closing doors. Drivers should check if passengers are getting off to stop these problems from happening again and to keep everyone, including children, safe when riding the bus.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Public Transport Office replied that to make bus rides safer, they hold 12 safety training sessions every year. They have also asked bus companies to do their own safety training.</p>
            <p>The Public Transport Office stated that it will keep telling bus companies to make sure drivers follow all standard rules. Drivers should carefully watch what passengers are doing inside and outside the bus. They should wait until all passengers have gotten on or off before closing the doors and leaving the stop. This will help stop passengers from getting caught by the doors and make sure everyone is safe.</p>
            <p>Also, all large buses in the city now have safety devices that stop doors from closing on people and warn if a door is not fully closed. Starting last year, there is also money to help install new active door safety sensor systems. To make passengers even safer, bus companies have been asked to install these faster. They plan to have 80% installed this year and all of them installed by next year.</p>

            <h1>Lu Chien-te Argues with Taipei City over Long-Term Care, Shih Chung-liang Says Policies Need Cooperation</h1>
            <p>Lu Chien-te, the Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare, has recently argued with Taipei City government several times about long-term care numbers. Today, Shih Chung-liang, who will soon be the new Minister of Health and Welfare, tried to calm the situation. He said that the central government makes plans and gets money, and local governments should use these resources well. They need to work together, and any areas that are not good enough will be made better.</p>
            <p>This morning, Shih Chung-liang went to a meeting about "The Latest Developments in Oncology 2025." Before the meeting, he spoke to reporters. When asked how to fix disagreements between the central and local governments in the future, Shih Chung-liang said he praises all city and county governments for their hard work in long-term care. He added that without their efforts, more people would not be using long-term care services today.</p>
            <p>Shih Chung-liang then changed the topic and explained that long-term care policies are made by the central government. After they get the money, local governments carry out these plans. This means that for long-term care to work well, the central government and local governments must work together.</p>
            <p>Shih Chung-liang said that the central government understands what local areas need, creates good plans, and gets enough money. Local governments must also use these resources wisely, spend the money correctly, and put the plans into action. Only then can long-term care be successful, and any weak points will be improved.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te recently said that "Taipei City is last in setting up long-term care services." The Taipei City Government disagreed with this. Yesterday, Lu Chien-te spoke to reporters by phone to explain. He said that the way they calculate how many people use long-term care services follows a single rule for the whole country. The bottom number (denominator) is the estimated number of people with dementia or disabilities who need long-term care. The top number (numerator) is the actual number of people using Long-Term Care 2.0 services.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te stressed that this rule is the same for the whole country. This makes sure that all cities and counties are compared fairly. It also shows how many resources are available and how many people are actually using them. He added that this is also a common way to measure things around the world.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Health Department said that each city and county is different in its population, medical help, and social services. So, the need for long-term care and how much it is used will naturally be different. Taipei City not only works with the central government's Long-Term Care 2.0 plan but also has many other programs. They use a "care replacement rate" which residents feel is most helpful. This rate shows the true results of their long-term care services based on what citizens need.</p>
