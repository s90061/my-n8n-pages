            <h1>Gold Will Not Have Taxes, Says Trump, After Gold Market Worries</h1>
            <p>Last week, the gold market was worried because of talks about new taxes. Today, US President Trump said on "Truth Social" that gold will not have these taxes.</p>
            <p>Last week, the Financial Times newspaper reported that the US had started taxing imported gold bars that weigh 1 kilogram. This made gold future prices go very high. The report said that 1-kilogram and 100-ounce imported gold bars should be put into a category that has higher taxes.</p>
            <p>But today, Trump said on his social media that "gold will not be taxed."</p>
            <p>Last week, when the news about the gold bar tax came out, the price of gold futures for December in New York reached a new high of $3534.10 per ounce on August 8. Later, the price went down a little to $3489.40, which was still 1% higher.</p>
            <p>These taxes on gold bars could badly affect Switzerland, which is the biggest place in the world for making gold pure. Switzerland has a similar tax rate of 39%.</p>
            <p>People often see gold as a safe investment. This year, its price has reached new high points because of tax worries and political problems in the world.</p>
            <p>Later, an official from the White House told AFP news that the government plans to release an official order soon to make things clear about the taxes.</p>
            <p>After Trump's message, the price of gold futures went down by 2.48%. It closed at $3404.70 per ounce.</p>

            <h1>US News: Trump Signs Order, Delays Higher Taxes on Chinese Goods for 90 More Days</h1>
            <p>Several US news channels reported today that President Trump has signed an order. This order will delay putting higher taxes on goods from China for another 90 days. This happened just hours before the current trade break between the US and China was going to end.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal and CNBC reported that the pause on higher taxes will last for 90 more days. Earlier this year, the US and China put taxes on each other's products. They stopped this "tax war" temporarily in May.</p>
            <p>In mid-May, top trade officials from the US and China talked in Switzerland. After that, the White House announced that the US would lower its taxes on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%. China would also lower its taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the break in taxes between the US and China was supposed to end at 12:01 AM Eastern Time on August 12 (12:01 PM Taiwan time).</p>
            <p>This new order will stop the US from increasing taxes on Chinese goods to 145%. It will also stop China from putting taxes on US goods up to 125%. If these high taxes were put in place, it would almost stop trade between the two countries.</p>
