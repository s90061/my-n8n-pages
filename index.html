            <h1>Li Qiang Meets US Representatives: China and US Should Work Together, Solve Problems Through Talks</h1>
            <p>On September 21, Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with a group of US representatives in Beijing. This visit happened six years after the last time a US Congress group came to China. Premier Li said that China and the US should work together as partners. He added that China wants to talk with the US to solve their problems.</p>
            <p>According to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Qiang stated that both China and the US are big countries with a lot of influence in the world. He said that a stable, healthy, and lasting relationship between them is good for both countries and for the world.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Trump have talked many times. They both agreed that China and the US should talk more and work together. This will help guide how their relationship grows in the future. China wants to respect each other, live peacefully, and work together for everyone to win. China hopes the US will work with them to make their relationship better. This will benefit both countries and the whole world.</p>
            <p>Li Qiang said that China and the US should be partners who help each other grow. They should be honest, empower each other, and achieve things together. China is ready to talk with the US to solve their issues, based on equality, respect, and mutual benefit. He hopes the US Congress will understand China and its relationship with the US correctly. He also hopes they will help increase talks and cooperation between the two countries. This would help create friendship and shared growth.</p>
            <p>The US group was led by Adam Smith, a Democratic Party representative.</p>
            <p>TVB News from Hong Kong reported that Smith said when he met Li Qiang that China and the US are the two most powerful countries in the world. He said it is very important for them to find a way to live together peacefully.</p>
            <p>He also said that "trade and money matters are the most important topics. But we also represent the House Armed Services Committee, so we care a lot about talks between the two armies."</p>
            <p>Li Qiang then said that this "ice-breaking" trip by the US side will help their relationship grow even more.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this is the first time since 2019 that a US House of Representatives group has visited China. Both the US and China are trying to talk more to make their relationship stable.</p>

            <h1>US: UK, Canada, Australia Recognizing Palestine is for Show</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 21 â€“ The United States said today that some of its important allies, like the UK, Australia, and Canada, are recognizing Palestine. The US called this action a "show."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that a spokesperson for the US State Department, who did not want their name used, said: "We are still focused on serious talks, not on putting on a show. Our main goals are clear: free the hostages, keep Israel safe, and bring peace and good times to the whole area after Hamas is gone."</p>
            <p>After the UK, Canada, and Australia, Portugal also said today that it recognizes Palestine. Many people think that France and other countries will do the same after the United Nations General Assembly starts its main discussions.</p>
            <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: "For many years, even with a lot of pressure from inside and outside the country, I have stopped this terrorist state from forming. We did this with strong will and smart political choices. Also, we have made the Jewish settlements in the Judea and Samaria Area twice as many, and we will keep going in this direction."</p>
            <p>The Judea and Samaria Area is the official name Israel uses for the West Bank, which it controls.</p>
            <p>At the same time, a high-ranking official from Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic group, said today that the recognition of Palestine by the UK, Canada, and Australia is a big win for the rights of the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p>Hamas official Mahmud Mardawi told Agence France-Presse: "These steps mean a victory for Palestinian rights and justice for our cause. They also send a clear message: no matter how many bad things the occupiers do, they can never take away our national rights."</p>

            <h1>Public's View on Inflation Rate: Cathay Financial Says 68% Expect Over 2% in 1 Year</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 22 â€“ Cathay Financial released its September survey on how people feel about the economy today. The survey asked people about prices and inflation expectations for the next year. It showed that 68% of people think the inflation rate will be more than 2% in one year. 32% of people think it will be less than 2%.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial released its September survey today. The survey showed that people are more hopeful about the economy. Also, people are more willing to spend a lot of money. The index for how hopeful people feel about the current economy went up to -34.4. The index for how hopeful they feel about the future economy also went up to -32.0. The index for wanting to spend a lot of money increased to -0.9. However, the index for wanting to buy things that last a long time went down a little to -19.7. The desire to buy a house went up slightly to -48.7. But the desire to sell a house went down to -36.3.</p>
            <p>Regarding the stock market, Cathay Financial explained that global trade policies are now more certain. Also, big central banks are expected to make money rules easier. Because of these reasons, international stock markets have risen. The survey showed that people's hope for Taiwan's stock market went up to 6.2. The index for people's willingness to take risks also increased to 8.3.</p>
            <p>For the current events question, the survey asked people about their opinion on the inflation rate in one year. The results showed that 68% of people think the inflation rate will be more than 2% in one year. Among them, 37% believe the inflation rate will be between 2% and 3%, and 31% think it will be over 3%. On the other hand, 32% of people believe the inflation rate will be less than 2% in one year.</p>
            <p>The survey also asked about the main reasons for price changes in the next year. It showed that 32% of people believe prices will change mostly because of the cost of everyday goods. Next, 27% of people think that the economy will cause prices to change. Another 13% of people believe that the prices of raw materials from other countries are the main reason for changes in prices in the next year.</p>
            <p>In terms of the general economy, the survey showed that people's average expectation for Taiwan's economic growth rate in 2025 went up to 3.19%. 60% of people think the economic growth rate in 2025 will be higher than 3%. The average expected inflation rate for 2025 stayed at 2.25%. 59% of people believe the inflation rate in 2025 will be higher than 2%.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial pointed out that on August 15, 2025, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) predicted Taiwan's economic growth rate for 2025 would be 4.45%. They also predicted an inflation rate of 1.76%. Compared to the DGBAS, people are still less hopeful about economic growth in 2025. However, they expect inflation to be higher.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial stated that the survey was done from September 1 to 7. Email surveys were sent to members of Cathay Life's official website and customers of Cathay United Bank. A total of 12,914 good surveys were returned.</p>
            <p>In recent years, inflation has been an important topic. People often call a 2% Consumer Price Index (CPI), or inflation rate, a warning sign. The Central Bank thinks that Taiwan is a small, open economy. So, it is better to have a flexible definition for stable prices. This flexible definition should be used as a guide for government plans and decisions.</p>
