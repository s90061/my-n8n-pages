            <h1>Trump Says the US Wants to Help China, Not Hurt It</h1>
            <p>After threatening to put a 100% tax on goods from China, the world's second-largest economy, US President Trump said today that the United States "wants to help China, not hurt it." This showed a softer approach.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump posted on his social media platform, "Truth Social," saying, "The United States wants to help China, not hurt it!" He also said that "respected President Xi (Jinping)... does not want his country to suffer an economic downturn."</p>
            <p>On October 10, Trump announced that starting November 1, there would be new taxes on goods from China. This was in response to China putting "very aggressive" new limits on exporting rare earth minerals.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rain in Mexico Causes Floods, Kills at Least 44 People</h1>
            <p>The Mexican government announced today that heavy rain for several days has caused floods and killed at least 44 people.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that tropical storms Priscilla and Raymond brought a lot of rain. This led to landslides and floods in five states.</p>
            <p>A government statement said that 18 people died in Veracruz state, 16 in Hidalgo, 9 in Puebla, and 1 in Queretaro.</p>
            <p>President Claudia Sheinbaum's government is starting a plan to help 139 towns that are affected.</p>
            <p>Pictures from the Mexican army showed soldiers using inflatable boats to rescue people. Some houses were covered in mud and water. Rescue workers walked through waist-deep water in the streets.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum posted on social media platform X, "We continue to watch the emergency in the states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, Puebla, Queretaro, and San Luis Potosi. We are working together with the governors and federal agencies."</p>
