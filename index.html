            <h1>Minimum Wage Goes Up: Monthly Salary NT$29,500, Hourly Wage NT$196</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor's Minimum Wage Review Committee made a decision on September 26. They decided to increase the minimum monthly salary from NT$28,590 to NT$29,500. The hourly wage will also go up from NT$190 to NT$196.</p>
            <p>This is a total increase of 3.18%. Almost 2.47 million workers will get more money. The Minister of Labor, Hong Shen-han, said there were three main reasons for this change. First, they looked at the cost of living. Second, they wanted to share the country's economic growth with workers. Third, they thought about how unclear global trade might affect businesses and workers. The Ministry of Labor will also help businesses affected by US tariffs.</p>
            <p>Workers' representatives said they were not completely happy with the decision but would accept it. Business owners' representatives said they were very happy with the meeting's result. They will now watch for the government's support plans.</p>

            <h1>Germany Presents AI Virtual Minister; First Video in Chinese Criticizes TikTok</h1>
            <p>The German government has introduced its first AI virtual minister, named "Weimatar." In its first video, Weimatar spoke in Chinese. It said that TikTok's computer programs make young people "addicted" and spread bad trends and strange ideas about beauty.</p>
            <p>Weimatar also said that if social media platforms want to work in Europe, they must be clear, responsible, and protect young people well. They also need to support free speech and different ideas.</p>
            <p>Weimatar is made by an European AI company called Synthesia. It looks and sounds just like Germany's Minister of State for Culture and Media, Wolfram Weimer. Minister Weimer said that AI brings many good chances for culture, creativity, and talking to people. But it also has dangers, like fake videos and false information. He said "Weimatar" shows a fair use of AI. It will protect new ideas and make public talks better for democracy.</p>
            <p>The government explained that Weimatar will be used in two ways. First, it will quickly share government messages in many languages on social media. Second, it will help create training videos inside the culture and media department. This will help with telling people about policies and reduce office work.</p>
            <p>Weimatar also spoke in Dutch about a music festival in Belgium where an Israeli artist's show was cancelled. It said, "Anti-Jewish ideas should not be in Europe." Then, it used Polish to talk about friendship and culture between Germany and Poland. Finally, it spoke in French, asking people to support European public media. This is to fight against false information and keep European culture strong.</p>
            <p>Germany is not the first country to use a virtual official. Ukraine's foreign ministry had a virtual spokesperson, Viktoria Shi. Albania's prime minister also chose a chatbot named Diella to be a "public procurement minister" to help with government projects and reduce corruption.</p>
            <p>However, using this kind of tool also has risks. The newspaper "SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung" thinks that the real problem with AI virtual people like "Weimatar" is not losing control of content. It is about people getting used to it. The newspaper said that if society accepts and gets used to trustworthy governments using these virtual people, the difference between real life and the digital world will become less clear. The newspaper warned that this could make democracy more automatic. Decisions that should be made by parliament and public discussions might slowly be controlled by technology. This could make democracy and human roles weaker.</p>

            <h1>France's Debt is Like a "Himalaya," Reaches New High of 3.4 Trillion Euros</h1>
            <p>The French national statistics office (INSEE) recently shared new numbers. In the second quarter of 2025, France's public debt reached 3.4 trillion Euros. This is 115.6% of all the money the country makes (GDP). This amount puts France among the countries with the highest debt in Europe.</p>
            <p>This new number is higher than the record from the first quarter, which was 3.345 trillion Euros, or 114% of GDP. In just the second quarter, France's debt went up by 70.9 billion Euros.</p>
            <p>The newspaper "Le Figaro" said that France's debt is growing very fast because the country has not made big changes to its economy like other nearby countries. The former Prime Minister, FranÃ§ois Bayrou, once said this debt was like a "Himalaya." It has grown by 1 trillion Euros in less than 10 years.</p>
            <p>On September 23, Alvaro Pereira, the chief economist for the OECD, gave a warning. He said, "France should be very careful with its money problems in the next few years. It must learn from countries like Italy and Portugal. These countries started to control their budgets again, but France's debt is still growing."</p>
            <p>In the early 2010s, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain were called the "PIGS" because they had big debt problems. Their debt grew a lot during the COVID-19 pandemic, but now it is starting to go down.</p>
            <p>Spain's debt reached its highest point in 2021 at 124.2% of its GDP. But it has successfully gone down to 103.5% in the first quarter of this year. Portugal's debt also went down from 134.9% in 2020 to 96.4% at the start of this year.</p>
            <p>Italy's debt went from 154.9% in 2020 to 137.9% this year. Greece's debt went from 163.9% in 2024 to 152.5% this year.</p>
            <p>Because of this, France is now the third most indebted country in the European Union, looking at how much debt it has compared to its GDP.</p>
            <p>On September 12, Fitch Ratings, a company that checks how financially stable countries are, lowered France's credit rating from AA- to A+. They did this because of political problems and money issues. At the same time, the new French Prime Minister, SÃ©bastien Lecornu, is trying hard to get everyone to agree on the budget plan for 2026.</p>
            <p>However, talks between Prime Minister Lecornu and other political parties have not made much progress. Also, big worker unions are planning to strike again on October 2. Groups that represent businesses have also said they will meet on October 13 to protest against possible new taxes.</p>
