            <h1>Asian Table Tennis Team Championships: Taiwan Loses to Hong Kong, Gets Bronze Medal</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 14 (CNA) â€“ Taiwan's men's team played against Hong Kong in the semifinals of the 2025 Asian Table Tennis Team Championships in India today. After a close match with five games, Taiwan lost 2-3. This means they did not reach the finals for the fourth time in a row. However, they still won a bronze medal.</p>
            <p>In the past, the "Asian Table Tennis Championships" included both team and individual competitions at the same time. But starting this year, team and individual events will be held separately in different years. This year's Asian Table Tennis Team Championships used a system where the first team to win three matches out of five games wins. Each match was best of five sets.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's men's table tennis team won silver medals in 2021, 2023, and 2024 for three years in a row. Because of this, they were the second seed and went straight to the quarterfinals this year without playing in the group stage.</p>
            <p>However, three of Taiwan's main men's table tennis players, Lin Yun-ju, Kao Cheng-jui, and Huang Yan-cheng, could not play due to injuries. Younger players Kuo Kuan-hung, Lin Yen-chun, Liao Cheng-ting, and Chang Yu-an played instead.</p>
            <p>In the first match, Taiwan's Liao Cheng-ting played against Hong Kong's Wong Chun-ting. They played five sets, and Liao lost 2-3. But then Kuo Kuan-hung and Chang Yu-an played and won their matches 3-0 and 3-1. This gave Taiwan an advantage, needing only one more win.</p>
            <p>Sadly, in the fourth match, Kuo Kuan-hung lost 0-3 to Wong Chun-ting. Then, in the fifth match, Liao Cheng-ting played against Chan Ho-wah. Liao was leading 2-1 after the first three sets. But he lost the last two sets 4-11, 11-4, 11-0, 6-11, 5-11 and was out of the competition.</p>
            <p>Coach Chiang Chun-wei said after the game that everyone tried very hard. He also said that Wong Chun-ting from Hong Kong is an older player, but he used to be one of the top 10 players in the world. He has excellent skills and experience.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chun-wei said that the important moment was in the fourth set of the fifth match. Liao Cheng-ting was leading 4-2. "The opponent called a timeout and changed their strategy. Liao Cheng-ting then played a bit too carefully and made more mistakes. This allowed the opponent to quickly catch up and win."</p>
            <p>Chiang Chun-wei said that this team had to play without much warning. Even though they did not reach the final, "the young players gained a lot of experience. Kuo Kuan-hung is only 16, and Chang Yu-an is only 19. They are the future hope for Taiwan's men's table tennis."</p>

            <h1>Belgium: 80,000 People Protest in National Strike Against Labor Reforms</h1>
            <p>Brussels, October 14 (CNA) â€“ Many labor unions in Belgium held a national strike today. They were protesting against the government's plans for pension and labor market changes. Because of the strike, public transport in Brussels was greatly affected, with many delays and cancellations. Police said about 80,000 people joined the protests. However, the unions said that about 140,000 people took part.</p>
            <p>The three main unions, ACV-CSC, FGTB-ABVV, and CGSLB-ACLVB, organized this national strike in Belgium. They said that "the government is attacking workers' rights." The unions want several things. These include better pay for working overtime, easier rules for early retirement, higher pensions, and job security for young workers.</p>
            <p>This morning, people from all over Belgium who were on strike arrived in Brussels. They gathered at Brussels North Station. The protesters carried signs and shouted slogans. Some also blew horns and let off colored smoke bombs.</p>
            <p>According to "The Brussels Times," early this morning, there were some cases of arson and damage to public property around the center of Brussels. Local police arrested several suspects. They released a statement saying that early investigations showed these were "deliberate acts, most likely to stop traffic."</p>
            <p>The protest march started from Brussels North Station and ended at Brussels South Station. Police closed roads to control traffic. Many union members also helped to guide people and keep order.</p>
            <p>One protester who works in public transport told CNA that the current government does not listen to workers' ideas. He said that the government continues to push "unpopular reform measures." This is why people keep coming out to protest.</p>
            <p>Young students and parents with children could also be seen in the march.</p>
            <p>Due to the strike and protests, public transport services today were largely stopped or delayed. Because there were not enough staff due to the strike, Brussels Airport and Brussels South Charleroi Airport cancelled all departing flights. Charleroi Airport also cancelled all arriving flights.</p>
            <p>The Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company (STIB-MIVB) announced on social media that the strike caused some subway, bus, and tram services in Brussels to stop or be delayed.</p>
            <p>The strike march finished around 2 PM. Police estimated that about 80,000 people took part. But Thierry Bodson, a leader of FGTB-ABVV, said that the real number of participants was closer to 140,000. He also said that they will take more action and strikes before the end of the year.</p>

            <h1>No Schools in Hong Kong Would Lend Location for Filming; Director Chou Kuan-wei Thanks Taiwan for Freedom to Make Movies</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 14 (CNA) â€“ The film "Suicide Warning" stars Golden Horse Best Actor Anthony Wong, Lin Yu-hsi, and Huang Di-yang. The whole movie was filmed at Yuan Ze University in Taiwan. Director Chou Kuan-wei shared that he could not find any school in Hong Kong that would let him film there. He said, "Finally, I found funding in Taiwan. I thank Taiwan for giving me the freedom to make movies."</p>
            <p>Chou Kuan-wei, who won a Golden Horse award for "Beyond the Dream," directed a new mystery school movie called "Suicide Warning." Today, the movie had a media preview. Chou Kuan-wei came to Taiwan specially. He brought Lin Yu-hsi, Huang Di-yang, Liu Ching, and Pai Run-yin to the event. They shared stories from behind the scenes of making the film.</p>
            <p>The movie "Suicide Warning" is about elite students who warn they will commit suicide before big exams. Director Chou Kuan-wei admitted that he once thought about ending his life. But the movie is not just about suicide. He hopes the movie will make people think about being human and find a reason to live. He also mentioned that after he finished making "Revolution of Our Times," no school in Hong Kong would let him use their space to film. Taiwan, however, gave him the place and the freedom to make his movie. Chou Kuan-wei is very thankful to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Pai Run-yin plays a character with ADHD. In a very emotional scene, he and Lin Yu-hsi pulled at each other and hit tables and chairs in a classroom. Chou Kuan-wei said he was worried Pai Run-yin might faint during filming. But the scene was finished successfully. He praised Pai Run-yin as a "genius actor."</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-hsi played the main female role in a movie for the first time. She remembered when they first practiced the scene, she saw the director cry. He was happy because the script was finally becoming real. This made her feel that "making a movie is very hard, and it reminded me again that this is a special thing."</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-hsi plays a teacher in an elite class. She remembered how hard it was in school to get high grades. She said that in junior and senior high school, there were always tests for six years, and the pressure was very high. Her grandfather was also very strict. If she didn't do well on tests, he would blame her parents. This made her feel very sad. "I remember clearly that every time before a big exam, I would always get a fever and get sick. Because of this, I usually didn't do very well!"</p>
