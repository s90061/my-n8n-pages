            <h1>German Lawmaker's Ex-Assistant Gets 4 Years, 9 Months for Spying for China</h1>
            <p>A former assistant to Maximilian Krah, an important lawmaker from Germany's far-right AfD party, was sentenced today to 4 years and 9 months in prison. This was for spying for China. This case makes people worry that Europe is a target for Chinese spies.</p>
            <p>The Dresden Higher Regional Court ruled that Jian Guo, a German man of Chinese background, gathered information for a Chinese spy agency. He did this when he worked for Krah. Krah was a member of the European Parliament at that time. Guo worked for Krah in Brussels from 2019 to 2024. During this time, he collected documents and files from the European Parliament and information about the AfD party.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 7 and a half years for Guo. They said that Guo started working for the Chinese spy agency as early as 2002. His work included watching Chinese people in Europe who did not agree with the Chinese government.</p>
            <p>A Chinese woman, known only as Yaqi X., was Guo's partner in crime. She was given a sentence of 1 year and 9 months, but she will not have to go to prison.</p>
            <p>Guo was also accused of being the one who contacted and directed Yaqi X. At the start of the trial, Yaqi X. said she had given Guo information about flight times and cargo movements. She worked for a company that helped with logistics at Leipzig Airport. Prosecutors said the information she shared included details about military planes, troops, and drones, and even equipment sent to Israel.</p>
            <p>Krah is currently a member of the German Parliament. This month, he told the court that he did not know Guo was spying. He said he hired Guo only because of his language skills and his experience with import-export companies.</p>
            <p>Krah himself is also being investigated for possibly laundering money and taking bribes from China when he was a member of the European Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in Germany has not yet talked to the media about this. In the past, China has said that claims of spying in Europe are not true.</p>

            <h1>Trump's 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan Gets Support from Russia and China</h1>
            <p>After U.S. President Trump talked about the situation in the Gaza Strip with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White House, he announced a 20-point peace plan. Israel agreed to this plan. Today, both Russia and China said they support this plan to end the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Dmitry Peskov, who speaks for the Kremlin, told reporters during a daily call that "Russia has always supported and welcomed all efforts by Donald Trump to end this ongoing sadness."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Of course, we hope that this plan can be put into action and help bring a peaceful end to the situation in the Middle East."</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a regular press meeting, "China welcomes and supports all efforts that help reduce the tension between Palestine and Israel."</p>
            <p>Also, today, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz met with the families of people held by the Palestinian group Hamas. He said that Trump's peace plan is the "best chance" to end the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the German Chancellor said in a statement that Merz said, "Israel's support for this plan is a big step forward. Now Hamas must also agree to it to clear the way for peace."</p>

            <h1>Hungary Blocks 12 Ukrainian News Outlets, Making Tensions Worse</h1>
            <p>On September 29, the Hungarian government announced that it would limit the use of at least 12 Ukrainian news websites in Hungary. On the first day of this rule, some of these Ukrainian news websites could still be used in Hungary. This action is seen as a way for Hungary to react to Ukraine blocking Hungarian news websites earlier. This has made the bad feelings between the two countries stronger.</p>
            <p>According to "Ukrainska Pravda" news, Gergely Gulyás, who is the head of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's office, said that Hungary has started a "response plan." This is because Ukraine blocked Hungarian news websites. So, Hungary is now limiting some Ukrainian news websites in Hungary.</p>
            <p>Gulyás wrote on social media, "A country that governs itself needs to respond strongly to such unfair attacks."</p>
            <p>The blocked news websites include TSN.ua, which belongs to the "1+1" TV channel and supports Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Other blocked sites are "Ukrainska Pravda," which supports Western democratic ideas, "European Pravda," which focuses on Ukraine joining the EU, and Hromadske, started by independent journalists. There are 12 such websites in total.</p>
            <p>In mid-September this year, President Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine's security service had blocked 8 Hungarian news websites in Ukraine. This included Origo.hu, which supports the Hungarian government. Ukraine said these sites were spreading pro-Russian views. This caused problems between the two countries.</p>
            <p>Gulyás said that Ukraine's real reason for blocking the Hungarian news websites was that these sites criticized sanctions against Russia, military aid to Ukraine, and how the EU and NATO were dealing with things.</p>
            <p>In response, Heorhii Tykhyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Ukraine blocked websites that spread pro-Russian political messages. He said that Hungary's actions are taking away Hungarian people's right to get factual news.</p>
            <p>Also, recently, both sides had a disagreement about drones crossing borders. On September 26, Zelenskyy said that Hungarian spy drones had entered Ukrainian airspace. But Hungary said this was not true and called it false information. On September 27, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Ukraine had proof.</p>
            <p>On September 29, Orbán responded by saying that even if a few drones crossed the border, it was not a problem. He also said, "Ukraine is not a truly independent country that governs itself. We (Hungary) have always been helping them, and they should not think they are independent."</p>
            <p>Hungary's position in the war between Russia and Ukraine is unclear. The Orbán government has voted against Ukraine joining the EU many times in EU meetings. It also opposes the EU using frozen Russian money to help Ukraine. This has created problems for Ukraine from Hungary.</p>
