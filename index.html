            <h1>Bannan Line Trains Stopped During Rush Hour, Taipei Metro Says It's for Safety</h1>
            <p>During today's morning rush hour, some people posted online that there was "something wrong with the Bannan Line." At 7:48 AM, a train stopped again when it was about to enter Taipei Main Station. The Taipei Metro Company said that the train stopped to keep a safe distance between trains. They added that trains would run normally again once the distance was right.</p>
            <p>Taipei Metro explained that for safety when trains are running, each train must keep a safe distance from the one in front. Because of this, trains will stop. Once the distance is correct, they will start moving normally. As far as they know, there have been no problems with trains running since early this morning.</p>

            <h1>Core Pacific City and Political Donation Cases: Taipei Court Calls Li Wen-juan to Testify</h1>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is hearing the Core Pacific City case and Ko Wen-je's political donation case. Today, the court called former Taiwan People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je, former campaign finance chief Li Wen-tsung, and accountant Duanmu Zheng as defendants. They also called Li Wen-juan, chairman of Muke Company, as a witness. Prosecutors and lawyers both asked questions.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office investigated the Core Pacific City case and Ko Wen-je's political donation case. At the end of last year, they charged 11 people, including former Taiwan People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je, Core Pacific Group Chairman Shen Ching-ching, and Taipei City Councilor from the KMT Ying Hsiao-wei. They were charged with crimes like taking bribes, making illegal profits, taking public money, and breaking trust under the Anti-Corruption Act. Prosecutors asked for a total prison sentence of 28 years and 6 months for Ko Wen-je.</p>
            <p>Besides the Core Pacific City case, Ko Wen-je is also accused of taking NT$6 million in political donations and over NT$62.34 million using Muke Company. He is also accused of using more than NT$8.27 million from the Jowang Foundation illegally. Today, the Taipei District Court held another hearing, calling defendants Ko Wen-je, Li Wen-tsung, and Duanmu Zheng, and calling Li Wen-juan to testify.</p>
            <p>Li Wen-juan is accused of working with Ko Wen-je and Li Wen-tsung to take political donations from Ko Wen-je and the Taiwan People's Party. Prosecutors charged Li Wen-juan with public money theft under the Criminal Code and breaking the Commercial Accounting Act. They asked the court to give a suitable punishment. In March this year, Li Wen-juan appeared in court as a defendant and said she was not guilty.</p>

            <h1>ASEAN Finance: US Adds 40% Tax on Transshipped Goods; Taiwanese Businesses in Vietnam Work for Tech Upgrades, Less Reliance on China</h1>
            <p>The United States and Vietnam have agreed on a 20% tax for imported goods. However, products sent through Vietnam to hide their true origin might have a 40% tax. Taiwanese businesses, which play a very important part in Vietnam's economy, say they are actively dealing with this. They are trying to get raw materials from different places and set up more local production to rely less on China. They are also working on using new technology like automation and reusing materials to turn these problems into chances for improvement.</p>
            <p>In early July, Vietnam was one of the first countries to agree on a trade deal with US President Trump. In early April, the added tax was a surprising 46%. Now, it has dropped greatly to 20%, similar to other ASEAN countries. But if goods are just being sent through Vietnam, they will get a 40% tax, which might cause problems.</p>
            <p>Two months later, some details about what "transshipment" means still need to be made clear. However, the Vietnamese government and Taiwanese businesses are actively dealing with the situation. They are using this chance to make their supply chains stronger and use more digital technology to become more competitive.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese businesses are the 4th largest group of foreign businesses in Vietnam. They have one of the highest numbers of factories and local workers, playing a key role in Vietnam's economic growth.</p>
            <p>On the 14th, during the big meeting of the Federation of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in Vietnam, the Central News Agency talked to four Taiwanese business leaders who have worked in Vietnam for 20 or 30 years. They wanted to understand the problems and how they are dealing with them.</p>
            <p>Yuan Chi-fan, the head of the Federation of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in Vietnam, has more than ten factories and over ten thousand workers in Vietnam. Many of his customers are well-known American brands.</p>
            <p>He said that in May and June, Liu Shih-chung, Taiwan's representative in Vietnam, called a meeting for Taiwanese businesses. Together, they asked the Vietnamese government to help Taiwanese businesses. "Actually, the Vietnamese government also worries that Taiwanese businesses might leave, so they support us here," he noted.</p>
            <p>Tsai Wen-jui, a past head of the Federation, owns a company that makes bicycle seats and mainly sells to Europe, so his company is less affected. He told reporters that when the Vietnamese government quickly talked with the US about the trade deal, they also asked for advice from Taiwanese businesses.</p>
            <p>Tsai Wen-jui said, "Very soon after the tax rates were decided, Vietnam individually told important Taiwanese businesses. Through different systems like the industrial park management, they asked Taiwanese businesses if they were affected, if they needed the Vietnamese government to talk or help with anything. They quickly gathered their opinions. Because of this, Vietnam acted fast and agreed on the tax rates in the shortest time."</p>
            <p>Li Tien-chi, the head of the World Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, mainly sells furniture for export. He has seen that the changing policies of Mr. Trump might make customers unsure. "Customers will be very careful. Now they are placing orders slowly and rarely because they are waiting to see if Trump will change the taxes again."</p>
            <p>Li Tien-chi believes that the tax amount will only affect Taiwanese businesses for a short time because, in the end, it will make prices higher for shoppers. He added, "Its effect will be to cause inflation in the US market."</p>
            <p>The US is not only putting a 20% tax on goods imported from Vietnam. It is also adding a 40% tax on goods sent through Vietnam from other countries like China. This aims to stop China from using Vietnam to avoid high US taxes on its products.</p>
            <p>To deal with this, Taiwanese businesses already have many plans. They are also showing their ability to be flexible and strong. They are taking this chance to change and become more competitive.</p>
            <p>Li Tien-chi said that the 40% tax comes from importing raw materials or partly finished products from China and then sending them out from Vietnam to hide their true origin. The way to deal with this is to "get raw materials from different places, not 100% from China, to lower the risk of falsely labeling where products come from."</p>
            <p>Li Tien-chi pointed out that Taiwanese businesses came to ASEAN 20 years earlier than Chinese businesses, so they are more stable. Many Chinese companies are only doing business for quick money and not for long. Some even use local people as fake heads of companies.</p>
            <p>"If Chinese people run away, the local people will face legal punishment, not the Chinese," which makes ASEAN countries careful. "Taiwanese businesses invest with their own money; they are not looking for quick gains, but truly want to stay for a long time. It is different."</p>
            <p>Yuan Chi-fan, whose company is called a "shoe-making giant," told the Central News Agency, "We have started to deal with this by using fewer chemical materials from China. We are buying elastic materials from the US instead. We started importing them in August to avoid relying only on the Chinese market. We also get materials from Thailand and Indonesia."</p>
            <p>To stay very competitive, Yuan Chi-fan's plan this year focuses on "automation equipment." This is to meet the world's stricter rules for ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance). At the same time, it helps use fewer workers and work better. Also, working on new ways to reuse materials and waste is important to "get better orders."</p>
            <p>Wu Ming-ying, a past head of the Dong Nai branch of the Federation of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, works in precise manufacturing. He admitted that when he first heard the news in April, he felt a lot of pressure with orders and schedules because things were unclear. But he saw the problem as a chance for change. He believes this situation "can help the company manage its production and goods more easily."</p>
            <p>In his opinion, if the 40% tax on transshipped goods is really decided, it will certainly cause problems for some companies. Taiwanese businesses have already started to deal with this. "We have slowly started to change to local production and try to rely less on parts from other countries," he said.</p>
            <p>Local production means making products locally instead of importing them over long distances. He hopes to encourage Taiwanese expert teams to go to Vietnam to help local areas improve their production skills. "Production skills are most important. Raw materials can be changed based on where they come from or political reasons, which is not a big problem."</p>
            <p>Wu Ming-ying pointed out that Taiwan has a big advantage in parts, skilled workers, and semiconductors. "We hope to help more cooperation between Taiwan and Vietnam to make industries here more competitive." For example, automation technology that can fix problems with production capacity is one of Taiwan's strong points. As Vietnam works hard to change its industries, he hopes Taiwan and Vietnam can talk and "make a big plan for cooperation in manufacturing."</p>
