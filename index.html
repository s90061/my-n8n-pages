Generation Alpha, born since 2010, is the newest group of young people. Unlike previous generations, they have always known a world with smartphones and tablets. Technology is a natural part of their daily lives. They are often called "digital natives" because they learn to use screens from a very young age. This generation is already influencing family purchases, like choosing which shows to watch or which games to play. Experts say that by 2025, there will be more than two billion Generation Alpha children globally. As they grow up, they will become important consumers and workers, bringing their strong digital skills with them. However, there are also worries about how much time they spend looking at screens and its possible effects on their development.

**AI Will Change Jobs, Creating New Opportunities**

A new report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of rich countries, suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) will bring big changes to the job market. The report says that while AI might replace some jobs, it will also create many new ones. For example, AI could take over simple or repeated tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative work. The OECD believes that about 27% of jobs in their member countries use skills that could be easily done by AI. However, they also say that the overall effect on employment will be positive if workers get the right training for new roles. Countries must invest in education and retraining programs to help people gain the skills needed for future jobs. This means lifelong learning will become more important than ever.

**Traveling Green: Making Sustainable Trips Easier**

More and more travelers want to explore the world in a way that protects the environment and helps local communities. This is called sustainable travel. However, it can often be difficult for people to find truly sustainable options. Many travelers want to make eco-friendly choices, but they don't always know which airlines, hotels, or tour operators are genuinely green. Recently, new tools and standards are emerging to help. For example, some airlines are using sustainable aviation fuel, and hotels are getting new certifications for their environmental efforts. There are also new apps that help travelers find local businesses and choose less harmful ways to travel, like taking trains instead of planes for shorter distances. These changes aim to make it easier for everyone to have a positive impact on the places they visit, ensuring travel can be enjoyed for generations to come.
