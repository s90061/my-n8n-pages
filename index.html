            <h1>US-Japan Military Drill: Typhon Missile System Shown in Japan for the First Time; China Calls for Its Removal</h1>
            <p>On September 15, the US military showed its "Typhon" missile system at the Iwakuni base in Japan. This was after China's military parade on September 3. It was the first time this system was seen in Japan. Today, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, said that the US and Japan are putting this system in Japan even though China strongly disagrees. He said China is very unhappy and against it. He asked the US and Japan to "remove the system quickly."</p>
            <p>Lin Jian spoke at a regular press conference for the Chinese Foreign Ministry this afternoon. He made these comments when answering a reporter's question, according to a report by The Paper.</p>
            <p>Lin Jian stated that the US and Japan are setting up the Typhon missile system in Japan for joint military exercises, ignoring China's serious concerns. China is very unhappy about this and strongly opposes it.</p>
            <p>He claimed that when the US puts the Typhon missile system in Asian countries, it harms the security of other countries. It also makes the arms race and military conflict in the area more risky. He said it creates a real threat to the security of the region.</p>
            <p>Lin Jian said that the US and Japan should respect other countries' security worries. They should act in a way that helps peace and stability in the region, not the opposite. China asks the US and Japan to "listen to what countries in the region are saying, fix their wrong actions, and remove" the Typhon missile system quickly.</p>
            <p>He also added that because of its history of military invasion, Japan's military actions are always watched closely by its Asian neighbors and the world. This year is 80 years since the "victory of the Chinese people's war against Japanese aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." China asks Japan to think deeply about its history of invasion. China wants Japan to keep following the path of peace. It also asks Japan to "be careful with its words and actions" in military security matters and "not to help bad things happen." It should not do things that "make Asian neighbors lose trust and harm peace and stability in the region."</p>
            <p>News from different sources said that the annual "Resolute Dragon" exercise, a big US-Japan joint military drill, started in Japan on September 11. About 19,000 people are expected to take part in the two-week exercise. On September 15, the US Army officially showed the Typhon medium-range missile system at the US Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. They also practiced setting it up. This was the first time this system was shown publicly in Japan.</p>
            <p>Before being shown in Japan, the Typhon missile system was seen in Australia in July during the "Exercise Talisman Sabre 2025." The US military also tested it with live ammunition. This was the first time the US tested this system outside of North America. In 2024, the system was shown in the Philippines and has not been removed since, which has made China very unhappy.</p>
            <p>Reports say that the Typhon missile system can carry SM-6 interceptor missiles and "Tomahawk" cruise missiles. It can hit targets up to 480 kilometers away. If it is put in Japan, this range could cover parts of China's eastern coast and parts of Russia.</p>
            <p>Colonel Wade Germann, who leads the US task force in charge of this system, said that the system will leave Japan after this joint military exercise. However, he did not say where the system would go or if it would come back to Japan.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rains Cause Disasters in Malaysia's Sabah State, Landslides Kill at Least 12</h1>
            <p>According to news reports today, heavy rains hit the eastern part of Borneo Island in Malaysia over the past week. This caused several landslides in Sabah state, killing at least 12 people.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that rescue workers said more than 2,000 people have had to leave their homes in low-lying areas, including around Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah. This was due to recent floods.</p>
            <p>The New Straits Times reported that the worst event happened yesterday. Rocks hit a temporary home outside Kota Kinabalu, the capital. Eight people died, and four of them were children.</p>
            <p>Another landslide happened yesterday in the Gana area, about 100 kilometers east of Kota Kinabalu. Three people died there, including a 10-year-old girl. Last week, in the Penampang area outside Kota Kinabalu, a 97-year-old man was buried by mud.</p>
            <p>Sabah state, in the northeast of Borneo, has had heavy rain for the past 10 days. Low-lying areas were flooded, and landslides occurred, damaging homes and important structures. Sabah is the poorest state in Malaysia.</p>
            <p>Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, sent different rescue teams to help in the disaster areas yesterday evening.</p>

            <h1>TSMC Stock Reaches New Highs Five Times in One Month; Foreign Investors Continue to Buy Over 13,000 Shares</h1>
            <p>TSMC, the leading company in its industry, reached its ex-dividend date today and quickly filled the stock price difference. During trading, its stock price went up to 1285 New Taiwan Dollars. It closed at 1280 New Taiwan Dollars, setting a new record for its closing price. Since August 13, when TSMC first closed at 1200 New Taiwan Dollars, its price has hit a new high five times in almost one month. This shows its very strong performance.</p>
            <p>Last week, foreign investors bought a large amount of TSMC shares, about 61,711 shares. Yesterday, they sold a small amount, 836 shares. Today, they started buying again, adding 13,671 shares. This helped the stock price continue to reach new records.</p>
            <p>TSMC first closed at 1200 New Taiwan Dollars on August 13. From September 10 to 12, it set new closing price records for three days in a row. Today, it closed at 1280 New Taiwan Dollars, which is 30 New Taiwan Dollars higher. This sets a new historical high for its closing price.</p>
            <p>Today, TSMC paid out a dividend of 5 New Taiwan Dollars per share. The total dividend amount is 129.663 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This money will be paid on October 9. This dividend affects the overall stock market by about 40.43 points.</p>
            <p>TSMC started paying dividends every quarter in 2019. All 24 times it has paid dividends, the stock price has successfully recovered to its original level after the dividend payout. Out of these, 18 times the stock price quickly recovered on the same day the dividend was paid. The longest time it took to recover was 15 trading days. For the fourth quarter of 2024, it took 10 trading days for the cash dividend to fully recover. Today, TSMC's stock price recovered immediately after the dividend payout, making it the 19th time this has happened on the same day.</p>
