            <h1>Doctor Chou Chia-cheng Dies After Being Hit by a Bus; Groups Want Mandatory Blind Spot Sensors</h1>
            <p>A doctor named Chou Chia-cheng from Taoyuan Hospital was hit by a bus and died in Taipei today. Some groups are asking the Taipei city government to quickly make dangerous roads safer. They also want all buses to have special sensors that find blind spots. They also want to change traffic rules. They say we should not wait for people to die to make changes.</p>
            <p>Today, a person walking in Taipei was hit by a bus while crossing the road. The person later died in the hospital. National Taiwan University Hospital said the person who died was Doctor Chou Chia-cheng, a breast surgery expert from Taoyuan Hospital.</p>
            <p>The "Road Rights for Pedestrians Promotion Association" sent out a press release. After checking the accident spot, they found that the crosswalk was 75 meters long. But there was no safe island for people to stop on. For an adult to walk across, it takes 60 to 65 seconds. But the green light only lasts for 69 seconds. This means old people, children, or people who cannot move easily must almost run to get across. This is very unfair.</p>
            <p>The association asked the Taipei city government to quickly make this dangerous road safer. They want to divide the long crosswalk into smaller parts to make it safer for people. They also want more lights on each part of the crosswalk. They also want traffic lights that separate people and cars. This means when people walk, cars stop, and when cars move, people stop.</p>
            <p>The association also said that all buses should have blind spot detection and automatic emergency braking systems that stop for people. They also want to change rule 134 of the Road Traffic Safety Regulations, which talks about people crossing the road. They want to remove the word "quickly" from the rule.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the association said that streets should be safe places for people to live, not places where lives end. They said we should not wait for another sad accident to happen to remember people. We should not have to lose lives to make things better.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Causes Changes to Tigerair Macau Flights on July 20th</h1>
            <p>Because of Typhoon Wipha's path and its outer winds, Tigerair Taiwan announced tonight that some flights will be delayed. This is for safety reasons. Flights from Kaohsiung to Macau and from Macau back to Taichung tomorrow will be later. Passengers should pay attention to this news.</p>
            <p>The center of Typhoon Wipha is slowly moving away from the Taiwan coast. The weather agency removed the sea typhoon warning at 5:30 PM today. But Tigerair Taiwan announced tonight that because of Typhoon Wipha's path and outer winds, there will be changes to flights on July 20th, for flight safety.</p>
            <p>The information says that flight IT321 from Kaohsiung to Macau and flight IT372 from Macau to Taichung will both be delayed until July 21st.</p>
            <p>Tigerair suggests that travelers use the "Flight Status" feature on their official website to check for the latest changes. The actual take-off and landing times will depend on the weather. The newest arrival and departure times for each flight will be announced by the airports.</p>

            <h1>US Says No to WHO Health Rule Changes, Cites Impact on Its Own Power</h1>
            <p>The US government, led by President Trump, said today that it will not accept changes made last year to international health rules by the World Health Assembly. These changes were about how the World Health Organization (WHO) deals with pandemics. The US says these changes take away its national power.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, after Donald Trump returned to the White House on January 20th this year, he immediately started the process for the US to leave the WHO. However, the US State Department said that the new words in the International Health Regulations still apply to the US.</p>
            <p>The International Health Regulations give the WHO a legal way to fight diseases. Last year, the World Health Assembly met in Geneva, Switzerland, and agreed on some changes. These included a statement about being "committed to unity and equality." This means creating a new group to study what developing countries might need during future emergencies.</p>
            <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. today released a joint statement. They said these changes "could wrongly affect our country's power to make our own health policies."</p>
            <p>They also said, "All our actions will first consider our people. We will not accept international policies that take away Americans' freedom of speech, privacy, and personal freedom."</p>
            <p>They also pointed out that the changed rules "do not properly solve the problem of the WHO being easily affected by politics and control during a pandemic, especially from China."</p>
            <p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X (social media) that the WHO "regrets the US decision to reject these changes." He strongly said that member countries' power would not be affected, and the WHO cannot force lockdowns or similar actions.</p>
            <p>Countries can object to the changes in the International Health Regulations until tomorrow at the latest. In the UK and Australia, conservative people and those who doubt vaccines have actively spoken against the changes. Both countries are currently led by left-leaning political parties.</p>
