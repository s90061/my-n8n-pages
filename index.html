            <h1>Taipei Court Reviews Interrogation Recordings for Jinghua City Case</h1>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is handling the Jinghua City case. Today, the court reviewed the audio and video recordings of former Taipei Deputy Mayor Peng Zhen-sheng's interviews during the investigation. The court called in former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, who is currently in custody, and asked Peng Zhen-sheng to appear. Other people involved in the case, Shen Qing-jing and Huang Jing-mao, also asked to be there.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office finished its investigation into the Jinghua City case and the Ko Wen-je political donation case at the end of last December. They accused former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, Weiking Group Chairman Shen Qing-jing, and 9 others of crimes like taking bribes, making illegal profits, taking public money, and breaking trust. They suggested that Ko Wen-je should be put in prison for a total of 28 years and 6 months.</p>
            <p>In April, Ko Wen-je's lawyer said that Peng Zhen-sheng and others might have been unfairly questioned by the prosecutors. The lawyer claimed that the records of the questioning were not consistent and should not be used as evidence. Especially, the lawyer pointed out that when the prosecutor questioned Peng Zhen-sheng, they said, "Are you willing to be Yu Wen now?", which clearly tried to make Peng Zhen-sheng blame Ko Wen-je. This was seen as unfair questioning.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court had planned to review Peng Zhen-sheng's interrogation recordings and videos on July 1st and ask him to give his testimony. However, Peng Zhen-sheng asked for time off because his wife had passed away. This was changed to July 26th. But Peng Zhen-sheng was still very emotional on July 26th, so the questioning was moved to September 2nd. If it cannot finish in one day, the hearing will continue on September 4th. The review of Peng Zhen-sheng's interrogation recordings and videos was set for today.</p>

            <h1>Nvidia's China Business Concerns Lead to After-Hours Stock Drop; May Affect Taiwan Stock Market</h1>
            <p>On August 27th, US stocks closed higher, with the S&P 500 index reaching a new high of 6481.4 points. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) American Depositary Receipts (ADR) increased by 0.24%. However, financial experts say that Nvidia's stock fell more than 3% after trading hours because investors are worried that its business in China might slow down. TSMC's ADR also dropped by over 1.5% after hours. This could be bad for the Taiwan stock market.</p>
            <p>On August 27th, all major US stock indexes closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 147.16 points, a 0.32% increase. The S&P 500 index went up by 15.46 points, a 0.24% increase, reaching a new high of 6481.4 points. The Nasdaq index rose by 45.87 points, a 0.21% increase, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 16.69 points, a 0.29% increase.</p>
            <p>Regarding news from local and international industries, Nvidia, the top company for AI chips, announced financial results and future predictions after trading hours that were better than expected. Its revenue in the second quarter was a record high of US$46.7 billion. For the third quarter, revenue is expected to be around US$54 billion, plus or minus 2%, which is higher than analysts' prediction of US$53.14 billion.</p>
            <p>Nvidia did not send its H20 chips to China in the second quarter. The company also said that its third-quarter predictions do not include any planned shipments of H20 chips to China. Investors are worried that Nvidia's business in China might stop growing, causing its stock price to fall by more than 3% after trading hours.</p>
            <p>Financial experts noted that TSMC's ADR, which is the main manufacturer for Nvidia's chips, fell by more than 1.5% after hours. Other AI-related stocks like AMD and Super Micro also dropped after hours. This might negatively affect the performance of the Taiwan stock market.</p>

            <h1>Key Supporter of Czech Exile Literature Passes Away; Published Over 200 Works Abroad</h1>
            <p>Zdena Salivarov√°, a Czech writer, translator, and founder of a publishing house, passed away on August 25th at the age of 91. In 1971, she and her husband started "68 Publishers" in Canada. They published more than 200 books by Czechoslovak writers who were living in exile. Her work is a very important part of the history of Czech exile literature.</p>
            <p>In her younger years, Czech writer Zdena Salivarov√° was also a singer and actress, outside of the literary world. She met the famous writer Josef ≈†kvoreck√Ω, and they got married in 1958.</p>
            <p>When the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, the couple was in the United States. They decided to stay abroad and later settled in Canada, where they started "68 Publishers." In 1990, they both received the Order of the White Lion for their contributions to Czech literature.</p>
            <p>Ivana Tomkov√°, an editor for French literature at the Czech publisher Argo, said that the events of 1968 greatly affected Salivarov√°'s life, just like they did for many people from Czechoslovakia. For the next 20 years, "68 Publishers" released over 200 works by Czechoslovak writers living outside their country and by writers whose works were banned inside the country.</p>
            <p>These published works included the Czech version of Milan Kundera's "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," former Czech President V√°clav Havel's "Plays 1970‚Äì1976," Nobel Prize winner Jaroslav Seifert's "All the Beauty in the World," Bohumil Hrabal's "Weddings in the House," and Ivan Divi≈°'s collection of poems, "The End of Happiness" (Konec ≈°tƒõst√≠).</p>
            <p>Tomkov√° stated that Salivarov√° gave almost her entire life and energy to the publishing house. "I believe that many books and writers would have been forgotten without her. They published works by writers in exile and those banned in Czechoslovakia at the time. These books were later secretly brought back into the country, so their work filled a big gap that would have otherwise existed."</p>
            <p>Besides being the main person behind the publishing house, Salivarov√° was also a writer herself. Her novel "Honzlov√°" is considered one of the important works of 20th-century Czech literature. This book is partly about her own life and is set in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. It shows the difficulties and conflicts a young woman faced under a government that had complete control.</p>
            <p>Tomkov√° commented, "Even though she didn't publish many works, her novel 'Honzlov√°' is truly one of the best works in 20th-century Czech literature."</p>
            <p>After her husband ≈†kvoreck√Ω died in 2012, Salivarov√° continued to live in Toronto. After the Velvet Revolution, she often went back to the Czech Republic. Her life's work made sure that the voices of Czech writers in exile were kept and passed on to future generations.</p>
