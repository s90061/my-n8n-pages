            <h1>Cuba's President Travels to Asia to Seek Help with Economy, Visits China, Vietnam, and Laos</h1>
            <p>Cuba's President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, said today that he has started a trip to Asia. He will visit China, Laos, and Vietnam. Vietnam is Cuba's most important partner for trade and business in Asia.</p>
            <p>Cuba, with about 10.9 million people, is having a very difficult economic time right now. Also, global trade is being affected by President Donald Trump's taxes on imported goods.</p>
            <p>Diaz-Canel wrote on the social media site X that they are visiting "friendly nations." He said these countries have a strong relationship, a history of working together and supporting each other, and have overcome challenges over time.</p>
            <p>According to the Center for International Policy Research in Cuba, Vietnam has become the biggest investor in Cuba from Asia since they started doing business in 2020. The total trade between them is around 340 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Vietnam sends rice, coal, chemicals, clothes, and electronic parts to Cuba. Cuba mostly sends medicines to Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Cuba recently allowed a Vietnamese company called Agri VAM to grow rice on 1000 hectares of land west of Havana, the capital city. Vietnam has helped Cuba with rice farming before. However, this is the first time a private Vietnamese company will directly farm in Cuba.</p>
            <p>Rice is a main food for people in Cuba. Each person eats about 60 kilograms of rice every year.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Higher Education and Job Fair Opens in Bangkok with 39 Universities and 12 Companies</h1>
            <p>To make education and business cooperation stronger between Taiwan and Thailand, the 2025 Thailand-Taiwan Higher Education Exhibition and Job Fair is taking place in Bangkok. It is held from August 30 to 31. Thirty-nine universities from Taiwan and twelve Taiwanese companies are there to find talented Thai people.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said in a press release today that 39 universities from Taiwan are at the exhibition. They are sharing information about their courses, how to apply, scholarship details, and advice for studying abroad. The organization that runs Chinese language tests (TOCFL) is also there. They are giving full information about Chinese language tests for students who want to study in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Visitors to the fair can also enter a raffle to win prizes. The main prize is a free three-month in-person Chinese language course from a Taiwan Chinese Language Center. Besides the education exhibition, the fair also helps with jobs. Twelve Taiwanese companies have booths to offer internships and career advice to Thai students. This helps students plan their careers after they study in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that educational cooperation between Taiwan and Thailand is growing. On June 20, they signed a paper to work together on technical and vocational education. This will give Thai students more chances to get practical training in Taiwan. To help the Ministry of Education's plan to bring and keep international students in Taiwan, the Taiwan-Thailand International Talent Exchange Hub opened in Bangkok on August 29. It will offer beginner Chinese courses, places for academic talks, and help with international cooperation.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that in the 2024 school year, over 120,000 foreign students came to Taiwan. Almost 5,000 of these students were from Thailand. This makes Thailand the 6th largest country sending students to Taiwan. This shows that there is still a lot of chance for academic exchange between Taiwan and Thailand. They will continue to hold events like this higher education exhibition to get more Thai students to study in Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>CCTV: Putin Arrives in China with a Large Group for His Visit</h1>
            <p>China's state TV, CCTV News, reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Tianjin by plane. He will attend the 2025 Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit. After this, he will go to Beijing for an event to remember the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the military parade on September 3rd. The report said that Russia announced a "large and important" group of people is with Putin. This group includes three deputy prime ministers and more than ten government ministers.</p>
            <p>CCTV News said that this is Putin's second visit to China since his official state visit last May.</p>
            <p>Russia is one of the first six countries that started the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The report said that because of the leaders of China and Russia, the relationship between the two countries is the best it has ever been. It is now "the most stable, developed, and important major country relationship in today's changing world."</p>
            <p>After his visit to Tianjin, Putin will travel to Beijing. There, he will take part in the events for the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.</p>
            <p>CCTV reported that Russia said a "large and important" group is with Putin on his visit to China. This group includes three deputy prime ministers, more than ten government ministers, and people from big companies. Putin's visit to China for these events shows how strong the full strategic partnership between China and Russia is in this new time.</p>
            <p>Before this, a helper to the Russian President, Ushakov, said in an interview that Putin would visit China for four days. He said that a trip of several days is not common for Putin.</p>
            <p>Some people think that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will also be at the September 3rd military parade. People are watching to see if a group against Western countries, including China, Russia, and North Korea, is being formed by the leaders who will be there.</p>
