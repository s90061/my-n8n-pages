        const text = `**Han Kuo-yu Criticizes Malicious Recall as Political Struggle, Declares "If the Grand Recall Succeeds, Taiwan's Democracy Will Be Nothing"**

As the "grand recall" enters its intense phase, Taoyuan Legislator Wan Mei-ling held an anti-recall briefing session tonight. Mayor Chang San-cheng, Legislator Hsieh Lung-chieh, and Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu successively arrived to show their support. They emphasized that Wan has been working hard in the central government to secure infrastructure and welfare for Taoyuan and assist in promoting legislation beneficial to the country and its people. Yet, she is now facing a malicious recall, which they called a political struggle. Han Kuo-yu declared that "if the grand recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be nothing," urging the public to vote "disagree" on July 26.

Han Kuo-yu jokingly remarked that tonight, the grandmasters of Wudang and Shaolin had come to support Wan Mei-ling, stating, "Grandmaster Wudang is Chang San-cheng, and Grandmaster Shaolin is me," drawing laughter from the hundreds of supporters in the audience.

Han Kuo-yu expressed that it feels like elections are starting again immediately after the previous ones ended last year, which he found unreasonable and not true democracy but political struggle. He highlighted Wan Mei-ling's exceptional constituent services, which have been praised by all. Despite her busy schedule and numerous meetings as a five-term city councilor and two-term legislator, Wan Mei-ling maintained a perfect attendance record and secured over 55 billion NTD in construction funds for the local area. Han questioned, "She works so hard, and now she's facing a recall. Does it mean the more excellent you are, the more likely you are to be recalled? This is against democracy."

Han Kuo-yu also stated that from his position as Legislative Speaker, he is well aware of which legislators are diligent in their interpellations. He expressed sorrow hearing the Democratic Progressive Party constantly advocating for a "grand recall success." He likened Taiwan's democracy to a wall that Taiwan has painstakingly built, and now, with this recall, the wall is on the verge of being destroyed.

Han Kuo-yu declared, "If the grand recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be nothing," asserting that Taiwan would no longer be able to boast about the preciousness of its democracy. He urged everyone to vote, emphasizing that not voting would be equivalent to not supporting Wan Mei-ling.

**Doctors' Groups Dissatisfied with Increased Medical Student Quotas; Ministry of Education: Not Exceeding Total Cap**

Eleven doctors' groups issued a joint statement today, expressing their dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Education's (MOE) intention to increase medical student quotas from the current 1,300 to nearly 1,600, warning that this could negatively impact the healthcare system and teaching quality. The Ministry of Education clarified this evening that while it has indeed adjusted the admission quotas for post-baccalaureate medical programs at three national universities for the 2026 academic year, this was done in consensus with the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) and does not exceed the MOE's authority to maintain the total cap of 1,300 students. Therefore, even for the 2026 academic year, the number of general medical students will not exceed 1,300.

The eleven doctors' groups released a joint statement today, stating that the Ministry of Education's decision in June to loosen medical student admission numbers by increasing enrollment quotas for post-baccalaureate medical programs at Tsing Hua, NCHU, and NSYSU has already provoked a backlash from grassroots doctors. They strongly oppose the expansion from the original 1,300 to nearly 1,600 students, warning that this move could negatively impact the entire healthcare service system and the quality of medical education.

However, the Ministry of Education responded this evening, stating that since 1998, it has collaborated with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's physician workforce planning, allocating 1,300 admission slots annually within the MOE's purview to 11 universities with medical departments. The three universitiesâ€”Tsing Hua, NCHU, and NSYSUâ€”established their post-baccalaureate medical programs in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's "Physician Training Program for Key Specialties with Public Funding." After the public funding program concludes in 2025, it was decided in a 2021 application review meeting that adjustments could be made within the total medical program admission quota, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's approval for the publicly funded student admission numbers.

The Ministry of Education also pointed out that since the MOHW's public funding program will not be continued after 2025, discussions were held in February of this year with the MOHW and other relevant agencies regarding the admission quotas for the three universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs for the 2026 academic year. After several consultations with the MOHW between February and April of this year, the MOHW responded that self-funded student quotas could be allocated to the three universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs starting from the 2026 academic year, provided that the total medical program admission quota of 1,300, which falls under the MOE's authority, is not exceeded.

Therefore, the Ministry of Education emphasized that considering the significant resources, curricula, and equipment already invested by the three universities, and the fact that students are still enrolled, along with the understanding that publicly funded students are not regular high school graduates, it was assessed that this would not affect the admission of existing university medical programs. Thus, in consensus with the Ministry of Health and Welfare, 35 self-funded student slots were allocated to each of the three national universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs. Consequently, the total number of general medical students for the 2026 academic year will still not exceed the overall cap of 1,300.

**No Veto! Presidential Office Announces Military Personnel Treatment Act Today, Military Pay Raises Effective January 1 Next Year**

The Legislative Yuan recently passed the third reading of the "Military Personnel Treatment Act" amendment, increasing the monthly allowance for R.O.C. military officers and soldiers in voluntary service by NT$30,000. The Presidential Office today issued a presidential decree, announcing the amendment of Articles 5 and 6 of the Military Personnel Treatment Act. This means that the Executive Yuan will not propose a reconsideration, and the pay raises for voluntary servicemen will be implemented starting January 1 next year.

According to the "Military Personnel Treatment Act" amendment passed by the Legislative Yuan, those who voluntarily join the military will receive an additional monthly allowance of NT$30,000, effective January 1 next year. Furthermore, in response to the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait and the increased workload of combat and combat support units, a new combat unit allowance has been added to incentivize officers and soldiers to join combat units.

The Executive Yuan previously stated that it received the third reading bill from the Legislative Yuan on the 19th, and political commissars and experts are jointly studying the constitutional issues within the provisions to carefully evaluate relief measures. The Presidential Office's announcement today of the Military Personnel Treatment Act amendment signifies that the Executive Yuan will not propose a reconsideration.
