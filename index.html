            <h1>US Expert Discusses Trump-Putin Meeting: No Progress on Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire, US Should Increase Pressure</h1>
            <p>The meeting between the US and Russian presidents ended today. US President Donald Trump said that both sides agreed on many things, but they did not make any deals. An American expert believes that the talks did not help much to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine. However, Russia did manage to delay new penalties. This expert thinks that Washington should change its plan. It should put more pressure on Russia or send more military help to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for almost three and a half years. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met today in Alaska. They talked about stopping the fighting. This was the first time the current US and Russian presidents met since 2021. After the meeting, Trump and Putin had a press conference together. Trump said they agreed on many topics but did not reach any deals yet.</p>
            <p>Daniel Kochis, a senior researcher at the Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington, shared his first thoughts. He said, "This is a bit disappointing." He added that they are "no closer" to ending the war than before the meeting. The two leaders did not give many details about what they agreed on. He said things "likely remain roughly where they were before the Alaska summit."</p>
            <p>Kochis explained that this meeting was similar to Trump's past phone calls with Putin. He said they "go around and around but never really get to a ceasefire." He thought that if they had truly agreed on something important, they would have said it at the press conference.</p>
            <p>He asked what would happen next. Will there be new meetings? Will the US try stronger penalties to make Russia stop fighting? He said these are important questions for the next few days and weeks.</p>
            <p>Kochis noticed that the meeting helped Putin delay some penalties from the US. Also, Trump really wanted to find a way to end the war. For Trump, it was worth taking this chance.</p>
            <p>Kochis said that if the US and Russia can meet face-to-face and still not stop the fighting, the US must try something different. This includes giving more military weapons to Ukraine or using more penalties. This would force Russia to change its actions.</p>
            <p>He said directly that Putin has not reached his goals. Putin does not feel he needs to stop the war and believes time is on his side. Western countries like the US and Europe must change their plans. Only then will Putin be willing to give up or at least agree to stop fighting.</p>
            <p>Trump and Putin met at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. This is the biggest military base in Alaska. After they arrived, Trump welcomed Putin. They walked on a red carpet together and took photos. Then, they got into Trump's presidential car and went to the meeting place.</p>
            <p>Kochis analyzed that it was not ideal for Trump to have Putin, a leader who controls everything, in his car. But Trump saw it as a way to start talks that he thought could lead to better results.</p>
            <p>He observed that Trump seemed excited at first, hoping the meeting would make progress. But his body language at the press conference clearly changed. Also, there was no time for questions, and a planned lunch and another meeting were canceled. This shows that the two sides did not truly agree on things.</p>
            <p>Also, Putin said at the press conference that if Trump had been president, the Russia-Ukraine war would not have happened. This was similar to what Trump has always said. Kochis thinks Putin was trying to praise Trump to make things better. This would help them keep their relationship going for future talks. For Putin, it was important to "keep talking, and for the penalties to never happen."</p>

            <h1>QuanPay's June Payments Over NT$5.5 Billion, Close Behind JkoPay</h1>
            <p>JkoPay's parent company, Jko Fintech, had problems in July with a stock deal and a court order to take its assets. According to the latest numbers from the Financial Supervisory Commission for June, QuanPay handled over NT$5.535 billion in payments that month. This puts it close behind JkoPay, which handled NT$5.903 billion. The difference between them is now only NT$368 million.</p>
            <p>In July, JkoPay's parent company, Jko Fintech, was involved in a fight over stocks with the company TaiSun. A court ordered Jko Fintech to pay back NT$3.6 billion and asked for immediate action to get the money. The Taipei District Court tried to take Jko Fintech's assets, but it did not work. This caused people to lose trust in JkoPay, which is a part of Jko Fintech. But then, the Financial Supervisory Commission said the money was safe. After that, businesses started using JkoPay again.</p>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission's latest numbers for June show that by the end of June this year, there were 33,132,836 e-payment accounts in Taiwan. This is 504,914 more than in May, an increase of 1.55%.</p>
            <p>Currently, there are nine main companies that offer e-payment services in Taiwan. These include QuanPay, JkoPay, EasyCard, iPASS, iCash, Gamania Pay, and Simple Pay. There are also 20 other companies that offer e-payment services along with their main business. These include Chunghwa Post and 19 banks.</p>
            <p>In the e-payment market, iPASS has the most users. By the end of June this year, it had 6.9809 million users. JkoPay was close behind with 6.929 million users. QuanPay was third with 6.2146 million users. Together, these three companies have more than 60% of all e-payment users.</p>
            <p>For the actual money processed in June, JkoPay was first with NT$5.903 billion. QuanPay was right behind with NT$5.535 billion. Compared to May, JkoPay's payments went down a little by 5.13%. QuanPay's payments, however, went up by 1.36%. People are now watching to see if the problems Jko Fintech had in July will change who leads the e-payment market.</p>

            <h1>August 23 Referendum Coming Soon; Lawmakers to Visit Third Nuclear Power Plant on August 20</h1>
            <p>A public vote on restarting the Third Nuclear Power Plant will happen on August 23. Lawmakers from the Education and Culture Committee will visit the plant on August 20. Kuomintang lawmaker Ko Ju-chun, who will lead the visit, said today that they will check how many staff are currently at the Third Nuclear Power Plant. They want to make sure the plant can be safe. As lawmakers who represent the people, it is their job to go and understand the situation.</p>
            <p>There is only one week left until the August 23 vote on restarting the Third Nuclear Power Plant. Also on that day, there will be a vote to remove seven Kuomintang lawmakers. On August 17, the Taiwan People's Party will join with more than 100 people from industries and schools, including Pegatron chairman T.H. Tung. They will support keeping the Third Nuclear Power Plant working longer. On the evening of August 22, they will have a big event in Taipei before the vote. The Kuomintang will also have meetings to talk about the vote on August 17, 19, and 21 in Yunlin, Taipei, and Kaohsiung. They hope to get people to vote "yes" in the referendum.</p>
            <p>Before the August 23 public vote, Kuomintang lawmaker Ko Ju-chun, who will lead the Education and Culture Committee next week, also planned to go to Hengchun Township in Pingtung County on August 20. He will look at how prepared the Third Nuclear Power Plant is to start working again.</p>
            <p>According to the plan for the visit, lawmakers from different political parties will leave Taipei by high-speed rail at 7:30 AM on August 20. Their first stop will be the Taipower Southern Exhibition Hall in Hengchun Township, Pingtung County. There, they will hear reports about the Third Nuclear Power Plant's units and staff. They will also get safety information before looking at the plant itself. After that, they will have a group discussion. They plan to return to Taipei by 3:00 PM.</p>
            <p>Ko Ju-chun said in an interview that what they will look at in the plant is still being planned. He explained that even though the Third Nuclear Power Plant is not working now, there is still a lot of work to keep it maintained. He does not want to bother the workers there too much.</p>
            <p>Ko Ju-chun pointed out that he believes the main purpose of this visit is to see the current number of staff at the Third Nuclear Power Plant. He wants to know if many nuclear experts left after the plant stopped working in May. He said that nuclear experts are very much in demand right now, as countries like the US are strongly supporting nuclear energy. If these experts leave, they will be gone.</p>
            <p>Ko Ju-chun said that lawmakers are not experts in nuclear energy. They cannot judge if the nuclear power plant's facilities are safe. But they can go to the site to confirm if the conditions for nuclear safety are there.</p>
            <p>He said that the opposition party wants to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant through a public vote. As lawmakers who represent the people, they should go to the site to understand the situation. However, he stated that this is just a normal visit by the legislature. Also, lawmakers are not the ones who will decide if the plant should restart. He hopes others will not see too much politics in this visit.</p>
