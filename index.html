            <h1>National Science and Technology Council: Taiwan Normal University Women's Soccer Blood Test Case Leads to Funding Recall</h1>
            <p>The case of blood tests on female soccer players at National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) has caused much discussion. Today, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) said it will stop funding the "Women's Soccer Assessment Platform" project. They will also ask for the money back that was given for the project. This includes over 2.46 million New Taiwan Dollars from NTNU and over 800,000 New Taiwan Dollars from National Central University. Also, NTNU's management fee rate will be lowered by 2% for one year, which is about 9 million New Taiwan Dollars. Furthermore, Chen Chung-ching and Chou Tai-ying are banned from applying for or doing NSTC projects for 5 years and 4 years, respectively.</p>
            <p>The NTNU women's soccer blood test case has attracted a lot of attention. The coach involved, Chou Tai-ying, had her coaching license taken away by the Chinese Taipei Football Association's Disciplinary Committee. She is also banned from all football activities for life. Because this case involves a sports science project funded by the NSTC, the NSTC held a press conference this afternoon. They announced what they will do about the NTNU women's soccer blood test incident and how they will improve how they manage things.</p>
            <p>The NSTC said that a lawmaker revealed the unfair blood test event for NTNU women's soccer players on November 28 last year. The next day, the NSTC asked NTNU to look into the matter. In December, they set up a special team. For professors Chen Chung-ching and Chou Tai-ying, who were involved in bad academic behavior, the NSTC started an academic ethics investigation and review in July this year. They checked all human research projects in sports science. They also worked with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to form a special group of different government bodies. This group checked all projects where the two people used blood samples in sports science.</p>
            <p>The NSTC explained that after reviewing the case, there are four main decisions. First, they will stop funding the big project called "Building a New Generation Smart Sensing and Assessment Platform for Women's Soccer Players' Psychology, Injuries, and Performance." Second, they will get back the money given for the project. NTNU needs to return 2,460,900 New Taiwan Dollars, and National Central University needs to return 808,800 New Taiwan Dollars. Third, NTNU's management fee will be reduced by 2% for one year, which is about 9 million New Taiwan Dollars. Fourth, Chen Chung-ching and Chou Tai-ying cannot apply for or work on any NSTC projects or awards for 5 years and 4 years, respectively.</p>

            <p>Taoyuan City, Taichung City, Changhua County, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Tainan City, and Hualien County have yellow warnings. This means people should be careful about temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>

            <h1>Dementia-Friendly Picture Book "A Glimmer Along the Way" Shows Grandpa's Fragmented World</h1>
            <p>"I don't know when, but my world needed to be put together with effort." For a grandpa with dementia, familiar things in his mind were like missing puzzle pieces. This is the National Health Agency's (NHA) dementia-friendly picture book, "A Glimmer Along the Way." It uses gentle pictures and soft colors to show people what it's like to live with dementia.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is becoming a super-aging society, meaning there are many elderly people. The number of people with dementia keeps growing each year. A study by the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that almost 8% of people over 65 have dementia. This means about 1 in 13 elderly people has dementia, and there are 380,000 people with dementia in Taiwan. This year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's National Health Agency made the "A Glimmer Along the Way" picture book. They want everyone to help create a friendly environment for people with dementia.</p>
            <p>The dementia-friendly picture book "A Glimmer Along the Way" tells a story from the perspective of a grandpa with dementia. It shows how his memory fades and how his family supports him. When the grandpa with dementia sees familiar things, sometimes his memory is clear, and sometimes it is blurry or broken, like missing pieces of a puzzle. Sticky notes and to-do lists become helpful tools in his daily life. They remind him what to do next, and they also help his family know how to support him just right.</p>
            <p>The picture book uses gentle drawings and soft colors. It says that with careful support from his family and kind help from the community, the gaps in Grandpa's memory are slowly filled with light and color. His life still continues at a familiar pace. Even though he faces many difficulties, Grandpa still tries hard to tie his own shoelaces and finish every small daily task. He does this to keep his feeling of being able to do things himself and his dignity.</p>
            <p>The picture book goes from "I don't know when, but my world needed to be put together with effort" to "I want everyone to know that the real me is still here." It shows that if people with dementia are understood and respected, they can live their lives well. The idea is "I am still me." Shen Jing-fen, the head of the NHA, said in a press release today that dementia is not a normal part of getting old. It is an important health issue that everyone in society needs to understand and support.</p>
            <p>Shen Jing-fen said that she encourages people to live healthy lives. They can do this by eating well, exercising, joining social activities, avoiding high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, and not smoking. These actions help lower the risk of getting dementia. She also hopes that by publishing the dementia-friendly picture book, the public will learn correctly about dementia, reduce negative ideas about it, and work together to create a friendly environment that understands and supports people with dementia.</p>
            <p>The NHA's dementia-friendly picture book "A Glimmer Along the Way" is planned to be printed by the end of October this year. A 2D digital animation will be finished by the end of November. After it is done, it will be put on the Health 99 website, where people can download it for free. The NHA encourages everyone to understand and be with people who have dementia to build a dementia-friendly environment.</p>
