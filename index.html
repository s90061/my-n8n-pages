            <h1>Typhoon Willow Causes Power Outages for 250,000 Homes; Over 35,000 Homes in Taitung and Tainan Still Without Electricity</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow hit Taiwan. Taipower, the electricity company, says that about 254,000 homes across Taiwan lost power at some point. Currently, around 60,000 homes still do not have electricity. Most of these are in Taitung County, with 18,981 homes, and Tainan City, with 16,648 homes. After these, Kaohsiung City, Chiayi County, and Pingtung County each have about 5,000 homes without power.</p>
            <p>The weather agency says that Typhoon Willow's strong wind area is still over Hualien, Taitung, areas south of Miaoli, and Penghu. But the typhoon is getting weaker and smaller. However, areas south of Chiayi should still be careful about strong winds and rain. Also, some central areas might have slightly higher temperatures at night because of the typhoon's air sinking.</p>
            <p>Taipower reported that by 7 PM today, 254,302 homes had lost power across Taiwan. Of these, 192,985 homes have their power back, but 61,317 homes are still without electricity.</p>
            <p>The cities and counties still without power include Taitung County (18,981 homes), Tainan City (16,648 homes), Kaohsiung City (5,209 homes), Chiayi County (4,338 homes), Pingtung County (4,237 homes), Taichung City (3,826 homes), Nantou County (2,342 homes), Yunlin County (2,248 homes), Hualien County (1,377 homes), New Taipei City (856 homes), Hsinchu County (680 homes), Taoyuan City (546 homes), Taipei City (18 homes), and Yilan County (11 homes).</p>

            <h1>"God Said" Company Cheated People Out of NT$4.5 Billion with Fake Investments; 8 People Charged in First Round</h1>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office is looking into a case where a company called "God Said International Network" illegally collected money from people through a fake investment platform. Starting in April this year, police searched many places and brought in more than 60 people for questioning, including the main suspect, a man named Chen. Recently, the first part of the investigation finished, and 8 people, including Chen, were charged with fraud and other crimes. The prosecutors also asked to take back the money they illegally gained, which is over NT$4.5 billion.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office announced today that the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office's anti-fraud center told them about "God Said International Network Company" possibly being involved in illegal money collection and fraud. So, they quickly put together a special team with the Investigation Bureau, the Criminal Investigation Bureau's Central Crime Squad, and police departments from Taichung, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Hsinchu County, Nantou County, Changhua County, Taitung County, and Yilan County to investigate.</p>
            <p>The special team spent many years gathering evidence. In April, June, and August of 2025, they carried out three search operations. They found the 62-year-old main suspect, Mr. Chen (also known as "Chen Guang"), along with system engineers, core members, branch managers, and regional managers. In total, more than 60 people involved in the case were brought in. After questioning, the court agreed to hold Mr. Chen and three others. The other more than 50 people were released on bail, paying amounts from NT$100,000 to NT$3 million.</p>
            <p>Investigators found that Mr. Chen and others from "God Said Company" set up an illegal investment platform to trick people into giving them money. They used a "P2P mutual lending platform" called "CCE China Capital Exchange" to openly ask people to invest.</p>
            <p>Since 2021, Mr. Chen and others held open investment meetings all over Taiwan. They told people that one investment would be NT$560,000, NT$610,000, or NT$760,000. They promised that after 8 years, the investment would reach NT$2 million. They also said the company would cover any missing money for the investment. They used a method where money from new investors paid old investors. This meant a yearly return rate of 32.14% to 188.39%, which was clearly too high. This attracted people to invest, and they collected over NT$4.5 billion.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors believe about 3,000 people were victims, and over 1,000 people actually reported the crime. After the Taichung District Prosecutors Office finished the first part of its investigation, they charged Mr. Chen and 7 others. They were charged with fraud, breaking banking laws, and money laundering. The prosecutors also asked to take back the more than NT$4.5 billion they got from the crime.</p>

            <h1>Hong Kong Female Coach Banned and Fined by Chinese Football Association for "Irresponsible Words"</h1>
            <p>The Chinese Football Association recently punished a well-known female coach from Hong Kong, Chan Yuen-ting. They banned her from games and fined her money. They said she made "irresponsible comments." This has made many people online criticize the association, saying they "only dare to punish but not speak." It is widely rumored online that after a game, Chan Yuen-ting directly said, "If the system problems do not change, even throwing more money at it won't improve results."</p>
            <p>On August 8, the Chinese Football Association announced that on August 2, during the 14th round, game 80, of the Women's Football Super League, a match between Guangdong Women's Football and Jiangsu Wuxi Women's Football was held in Shenzhen. At the press conference after the game, Chan Yuen-ting, an official from Jiangsu Wuxi Women's Football, "made irresponsible comments, which caused a bad impact." Because of this, according to the "Chinese Football Association Disciplinary Rules," she was banned from 1 game and fined 5,000 Chinese Yuan (about 21,000 New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>The announcement did not say what Chan Yuen-ting's "irresponsible comments" were. But it is widely said online that she said, "If the system problems do not change, even throwing more money at it won't improve results." This sentence clearly pointed to the Chinese Football Association.</p>
            <p>It is interesting that videos, content, and news reports from that press conference cannot be found online anymore.</p>
            <p>Yin Bo, a famous Chinese football commentator, posted on August 11, revealing that the reporters who attended the press conference that day, the staff who hosted it, and a Jiangsu Women's Football player who was with Chan Yuen-ting, were all told not to say anything about what Chan Yuen-ting said.</p>
            <p>Yin Bo criticized the Chinese Football Association for "only daring to punish but not speak." He said there could only be one reason for this: they feel guilty.</p>
            <p>He said that Chan Yuen-ting did not criticize the referee or her opponents. So, there is only one answer: she criticized the Football Association.</p>
            <p>Yin Bo openly stated that past Chinese Football Associations have often used unfair methods, like treating critics badly or using biased referees, to control disobedient people. But openly punishing someone for "speech crimes" like Chan Yuen-ting's case seems to be the first time in history.</p>
            <p>He stressed that Chan Yuen-ting has the right to criticize the Football Association, and there is no doubt about this. The Football Association can disagree or not accept her criticism, but "using their power to punish her to silence her is going too far."</p>
            <p>After the news of Chan Yuen-ting's punishment came out, Chinese netizens on Weibo strongly supported her. They said she "spoke the truth and caused trouble." They criticized the Chinese Football Association, saying, "If they can't solve the problem, they solve the person who points out the problem."</p>
            <p>According to Sing Tao Daily, 37-year-old Chan Yuen-ting is from Hong Kong and used to be a female football player. In December 2015, she became the head coach of the Hong Kong Premier League team Eastern. She was the first female coach for a men's professional football team in Hong Kong. In 2016, she led Eastern to win the Senior Challenge Shield and the Hong Kong Premier League championship. This made her the first female coach to win a title with a men's team.</p>
            <p>In July 2019, Chan Yuen-ting became the head coach of the China National Women's U16 football team. In March 2022, she became the head coach of the Jiangsu Wuxi Women's Football Club.</p>
