            <h1>China's High-Level Official Meets Tim Cook; Says US is the Reason for Trade Problems</h1>
            <p>On October 17, Li Yaxuan, a reporter from Central News Agency, reported that Wang Wentao, China's Minister of Commerce, met with Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, in Beijing. Wang Wentao stated that the main reason for the issues in trade between China and the US is that the US put many restrictions on China after their talks in Madrid. These restrictions greatly hurt China's interests.</p>
            <p>According to what China's Ministry of Commerce said, Wang Wentao met with Cook on October 16. They talked about the trade relationship between China and the US, and how Apple's business is growing in China.</p>
            <p>Wang Wentao said that because of the plans set by the leaders of China and the US, their trade teams have had four meetings since May this year. These meetings have helped to make the trade relationship between the two countries more stable.</p>
            <p>Wang Wentao criticized that recent problems in China-US trade happened because the US put many limits on China after the trade talks in Madrid. He said this severely damaged China's interests and made the trade talks difficult.</p>
            <p>Wang Wentao stressed that both sides need to work together to keep the China-US trade relationship stable. He hopes the US will work with China, following the important ideas from their leaders' phone call. He also hopes they can find ways to solve problems through fair discussions. This would create a more stable future and environment for businesses in both countries to work together.</p>
            <p>Wang Wentao said that the Chinese government will continue to open up its markets to foreign businesses and improve the business environment. This will allow foreign companies to share in China's growth. He welcomes Apple to continue working closely with China and invest more in the country.</p>
            <p>According to official information from China's Ministry of Commerce, Tim Cook said during the meeting that Apple will continue to focus on and grow in China. He added that Apple will actively take part in China's high-quality development. He also mentioned that a good trade relationship between the US and China is very important for both countries. It also helps the global economy stay stable and grow. Apple wants to help promote cooperation and shared success between the US and China.</p>
            <p>On October 16, He Lifeng, China's Vice Premier, met with Tim Cook and his group at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. Cook attended the meeting as the chairman of the advisory board for Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management.</p>
            <p>According to Xinhua News Agency, He Lifeng said at the meeting that China is working hard to create one big market across the country. He also said that China is committed to opening up its markets more and working to achieve steady economic growth. China wants to work with other countries for everyone's benefit, share chances for high-quality development, and achieve success together.</p>
            <p>He Lifeng stated that he hopes the advisory board members will continue to act as a bridge, actively supporting China's economic growth and exchanges and cooperation between China and other countries. Cook and others replied that they are positive about China's future. They said they want to continue working deeply in the Chinese market and keep increasing their investments and cooperation in China.</p>
            <p>According to the official website of Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management, its advisory board was established in October 2000. It was started by Zhu Rongji, who was then the dean of the school and also the Premier of China. Most of the board members are chairmen of international companies, deans of top business schools, or Nobel Prize winners in economics. Tim Cook has been the chairman since 2019.</p>

            <h1>Zheng Yilin, Former Deputy Executive Director of Green Energy Center, Suspected of Taking Bribes; Prosecutors Ask to Keep Him in Jail</h1>
            <p>On October 17, Lin Changchun, a reporter from Central News Agency, reported that Zheng Yilin, who used to be the Deputy Executive Director of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Green Energy Technology Industry Promotion Center, is accused of taking bribes. In August, prosecutors in Taipei searched and questioned Zheng Yilin and others. The prosecutor then asked to keep Zheng Yilin and two other people in jail without contact, based on charges like corruption. The request was approved. Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office asked for a two-month extension to keep them in jail.</p>
            <p>Investigators received a report saying that while Zheng Yilin was the Deputy Executive Director of the Green Energy Promotion Center, he allegedly used bank accounts of his relatives and friends to take bribes. These payments were called "consulting fees" and came from Dongwei Construction and Hon Hai Energy. He is also accused of using his power to pressure Taipower. He is suspected of breaking several laws, including the Anti-Corruption Act for taking bribes without breaking his official duties, the Act on Property-Source Unidentifiable Crime, and the Money Laundering Control Act.</p>
            <p>On August 25, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office told the Tainan City Investigation Office of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau to carry out 22 searches. They searched the homes and offices of 9 people, including Zheng Yilin, Chen Jiansheng (the founder of Dongwei Construction), and his son Chen Guantao. They also searched the two companies involved. Nine people, including Zheng Yilin, were questioned, as well as five witnesses. Investigators also requested related documents from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower Company.</p>
            <p>After further questioning, the prosecutor asked the court to keep Zheng Yilin, Chen Jiansheng, and Chen Guantao in jail, and the court agreed. The general manager surnamed Zhou from Hon Hai Energy was allowed to pay a bail of NT$1 million and was not allowed to leave Taiwan or go to sea. An accountant surnamed Zheng was also given NT$800,000 bail and was not allowed to leave Taiwan or go to sea. Zheng Yilin's father and mother each paid NT$100,000 bail. Zheng Yilin's male friend surnamed Xu and a retired Taipower vice general manager surnamed Xiao were released.</p>

            <h1>Risks from Non-Bank Lending Might Grow; IMF Tells Countries to Be Careful and Control More</h1>
            <p>On October 16, Central News Agency, reporting from Washington, said that Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), stated today that after two US car companies closed down, the IMF is telling countries to pay more attention to possible increasing risks in the non-bank lending market.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Georgieva spoke at a press conference during the IMF and World Bank (WB) annual meetings in Washington. She pointed out that financial institutions that are not traditional banks are watched less closely, so it's easier for them to build up risks.</p>
            <p>She said that if these risks continue to grow, they could eventually put the global economy in a "difficult situation."</p>
            <p>In September, First Brands, a company that makes car parts, and Tricolor, a company that gives car loans to people with bad credit, both went out of business. Both companies relied on private loans to get money. This made people worry that the credit system on Wall Street, which is worth trillions of dollars, might have grown too much.</p>
            <p>Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Group, warned during a meeting about their financial results: "When you see one cockroach, there are probably more, so everyone should be careful."</p>
            <p>Georgieva said that she is not yet ready to warn about a widespread financial crisis. However, she asked regulators and finance ministries to stay alert.</p>
            <p>She said, "Whether these problems might get worse depends on two things: how well the economy is doing, and how big the troubled non-bank financial companies are. So, we are asking for more attention to be paid to these non-bank financial companies."</p>
            <p>Georgieva stated that since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, major central banks have greatly increased their money reserves. Also, because the US dollar is used as a reserve currency, the US has a strong supply of available money. This means that the world is better prepared to handle problems in the credit market than before.</p>
            <p>She said, "Our situation is different from the global financial crisis. We learned lessons and took action."</p>
            <p>However, Georgieva mentioned that since the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have used up a lot of their financial backups. This means they have less room to react quickly if there are economic problems.</p>
            <p>She said, "We are watching what is happening very closely... So far, there aren't too many 'cockroaches'."</p>
