            <h1>German Chancellor Says Meeting Between Putin and Zelenskyy is Unlikely; Criticizes Russia's Night Attack on Kyiv</h1>
            <p>The German Chancellor, Mr. Merz, said on August 28 that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "clearly" will not happen now. Many people hoped for this meeting.</p>
            <p>Mr. Merz spoke to the media while standing with French President Emmanuel Macron. He said that because Zelenskyy and Putin will not meet, it is different from what US President Trump and Putin agreed on last week in Washington. Therefore, the German and French governments will talk about the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Also, Mr. Merz stated that Russia showed its true face during a recent night attack on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. This attack caused at least 17 deaths.</p>
            <p>Mr. Merz wrote on the social media platform X that the building for the European Union (EU) office in Kyiv was also damaged in the attack. He said this "shows that the Russian government is becoming more and more reckless."</p>

            <h1>Rakuten's Taiwanese Player Sung Chia-Hao Joins First Team After Knee Surgery Before Season</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese pitcher Sung Chia-Hao for the Rakuten Golden Eagles in Japan has moved up to the main team today. Before this season, he had surgery on his right knee. He started playing rehab games in the minor league on August 23. He has not played in the main team yet this season. He might play today in Rakuten's game against the Nippon-Ham Fighters.</p>
            <p>Sung Chia-Hao had surgery on the outer part of his right knee before the season. So, he could not start playing when the season began. Doctors thought he would need 6 months to return. He played his first rehab game in the minor league on August 23. He pitched for 0.1 innings and gave up 2 runs (1 earned run). His fastest pitch was 151 kilometers per hour. Then, on August 26, he pitched for 1 inning and did not give up any runs, getting three outs quickly. His fastest pitch was 149 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>The Rakuten Golden Eagles team made some changes to their players today. They brought pitcher Sung Chia-Hao and infielder Koda Komori up to the main team. They sent pitcher Tomoyuki Matsui to the minor league. The Rakuten Golden Eagles will play against the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in Hokkaido today. Sung Chia-Hao might play his first game in the main team this season.</p>
            <p>Last year, Sung Chia-Hao played in 41 games for the main team in Japan. He pitched for 39.2 innings. He won 1 game, lost 2 games, and helped his team by holding the lead 17 times. He got 22 strikeouts. His ERA (how many runs he allowed per game) was 3.18. In his whole career in Japan, he has played 338 games and held the lead 120 times.</p>

            <h1>Silergy: Company Expects Less Than 20% Sales Growth This Year Due to Lower Customer Demand</h1>
            <p>The chairman of Silergy-KY, Mr. Chen Wei, a company that makes power management chips, said today that their sales this year will likely be more than last year. However, customers are buying less than expected. So, the company's sales growth might not reach 20%.</p>
            <p>Silergy-KY held an online meeting for investors in the afternoon. Mr. Chen Wei said that sales in the third quarter will be similar to or a little higher than the second quarter, like in previous years. He also said that demand will be better in the second half of the year for new energy products, cars, and things related to AI data centers, like servers, optical parts, and storage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Wei explained that the demand for power management chips is increasing after a very low period. But, trade taxes have made market demand go down. Customers are also being careful about how much they make. This means demand is weaker than they thought. This might stop the company's sales growth from reaching 20% this year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Wei said that where they sell their products in the third quarter should stay mostly the same. The prices they sell at will also stay steady. He expects the gross profit margin (the money they make after costs) to be between 52% and 54%.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Wei mentioned that customers are placing urgent orders right now, but the future is still unclear. Silergy-KY does not plan to raise its product prices, unlike some other companies. Instead, they will focus on getting a bigger share of the market.</p>
            <p>About their progress in AI servers, Mr. Chen Wei said that Silergy-KY has made good progress with special chips for AI. However, customers are still getting ready to produce many of these chips. So, these chips will not add much to sales this year. But next year, they expect these chips to bring in about 5% of their total sales.</p>
