            <h1>Trump Meets Zelenskyy: Russian Planes in NATO Airspace Should Be Shot Down</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C., September 23 â€“ Today, U.S. President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United Nations General Assembly. They talked about the war between Russia and Ukraine, among other things. Before their meeting, Trump told reporters that he believes if Russian planes fly into countries that are part of NATO, those planes should be shot down. However, when asked if the U.S. would help NATO countries in such a situation, he said, "It depends on the situation."</p>
            <p>The main talks at the United Nations General Assembly started today, and many world leaders, including Donald Trump, gave speeches. After his speech, Trump had several meetings, including one with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Before their talk, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke briefly to reporters and answered questions. The White House stated that their meeting lasted about one hour.</p>
            <p>Trump said he had many important meetings planned for today, and the one with Ukraine was very important. Zelenskyy thanked Trump for trying to help end the war between Russia and Ukraine. He told Trump about the situation of the Ukrainian army in the war and they also talked about how to stop the war and keep Ukraine safe.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy shared that the Ukrainian army has recently had some good news. He hopes that with Trump's help, the war can end. He also said that more pressure and punishments are needed for Russia. He supports Trump's idea that European countries should stop buying energy from Russia.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy explained that he spoke with the leader of Slovakia. He believes that if Slovakia has other options for energy, they will agree to stop buying energy from Russia.</p>
            <p>Earlier news reports said that since Russia fully invaded Ukraine in 2022, the European Union, which has 27 countries, has stopped most oil imports from Russia. Only Hungary and Slovakia are still buying Russian oil.</p>
            <p>Also, recently, many Russian drones flew into Polish airspace. Then, on September 19, Russian fighter jets were seen flying into Estonian airspace.</p>
            <p>When asked by reporters if NATO countries should shoot down Russian military planes if they enter NATO airspace, Trump answered, "Yes." But when asked if the United States would support or help NATO countries in this matter, he said, "It depends on the situation."</p>
            <p>Regarding his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and if he still trusts him, Trump said, "I will tell you in about a month."</p>
            <p>When asked what progress has been made in the Russia-Ukraine war since his last meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump replied that the biggest progress is that Russia's economy is now in a very bad state, "it is falling apart." Ukraine has done a very good job of stopping Russia's large army.</p>
            <p>He added that it looks like this war will continue for a long time.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Woman Attacked in London Gets Early Police Statement; Police Admit Initial Response Was Not Good Enough</h1>
            <p>London, September 23 â€“ On the evening of September 20, a Taiwanese woman was attacked by a group of people for no reason in London. When the police received the call, they did not go to the scene. Also, they had planned to take her statement five days later. Today, London police said that their first response was not good enough. They will talk with the victim, and they have already started taking her statement earlier than planned.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police in London told CNA, "We understand the pain this event caused the victim. We also agree that our first actions were not as good as we want them to be. We will talk more with her (the victim) about this situation while we are investigating."</p>
            <p>Around the time CNA got the police statement in the evening, the police rang the doorbell at the victim, Ms. Chen's home. They said they could now take her statement. Staff from the Taiwan Representative Office in the UK also quickly arrived to help. The police had originally told Ms. Chen that they would not be free to take her statement until September 25.</p>
            <p>The statement was finished around 8 PM today. Ms. Chen told CNA that the police asked very detailed questions. They also told her that another police officer would contact her later.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen advises Taiwanese people living or visiting the UK that if something similar happens to them, they can report it on the Metropolitan Police's "Hate Crime" platform. This might help the police respond faster.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen, a 25-year-old woman from Taiwan, is legally living and working in the UK with a "Post-Study Work Visa" (PSW). On the evening of September 20, while she was going home, four white teenage girls attacked her without reason in central London. She fell to the ground and was punched and kicked. Her hair was pulled, and her head was repeatedly forced down and hit hard against a wall.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen told CNA today that after the police received the report, they did not go to the scene to check what happened. A friend who helped report the incident said that the police seemed to think that if there was no "immediate danger to life," police officers did not need to go to the scene quickly.</p>
            <p>The police contacted Ms. Chen almost three hours after the incident. They told her that if she wanted to give a statement, she had to book an appointment. But because many people were waiting, the police could only go to her home to take her statement on the morning of September 25 at the earliest, while she was recovering there. Ms. Chen told CNA that perhaps because of the severe emotional shock, her memory of the event is becoming less clear. She was sad that she could not tell the police what happened earlier.</p>
            <p>CNA also asked the police this morning why the victim had to wait several days to give a statement, and if violent attacks on minority groups in the greater London area have increased recently. The police responded within an hour, saying they would look into the situation further.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police told CNA by email this evening that the police are investigating an attack on a woman that happened on Saturday, September 20, on Collier Street in Islington, London. This incident "is thought to be racially motivated."</p>
            <p>The spokesperson said that as part of the investigation, officers are in touch with the victim. No one has been arrested yet. The police ask any witnesses or anyone with information to call 101 and tell them the case number CAD 7097/20SEP. The Metropolitan Police is dedicated to fighting "all types of hate crime."</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, London has seen several protests against illegal immigration. In the middle of this month, a large protest took place with at least 110,000 people, according to police estimates. One of the main figures was Tommy Robinson, a leader of the UK's far-right who has been convicted of crimes. During the event, almost 30 police officers on duty were violently attacked.</p>
            <p>Even though some people are worried that hate crimes related to race and immigration might be increasing in the UK, data from the Metropolitan Police shows that in the 12 months up to the end of August this year, the number of hate crime cases in greater London went down by 17.4% compared to the same time last year. The number of cases that led to successful prosecutions went up by about 5%.</p>
            <p>Police data shows that from the summer of 2022 to the summer of 2025, over three years, there were nearly 96,000 hate crimes in London. Hate crimes are not only motivated by race but also include hatred against religious beliefs and people with disabilities.</p>
