            <h1>Study: Countries Are Getting Involved as Semiconductor Industry Moves Towards Vertical Integration and Chiplets</h1>
            <p>SEMICON Taiwan, a big event for the semiconductor industry, will start on September 10. Mr. Huang Yi-ping, a vice general manager at DIGITIMES, a research company, said this year's event will be the biggest ever. He sees three main trends for the semiconductor industry: countries are becoming more involved, leading companies are doing more steps of production themselves (vertical integration), and small chips called "chiplets" will become a very important market.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang explained that the United States and China are both doing similar things. Their governments are getting involved in the semiconductor industry. After 2010, and especially after the trade war between the US and China, both countries started to see semiconductors as very important for their national plans. When ChatGPT came out in November 2022, both countries realized that semiconductors combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) are key to a country's power.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang said that both the US and China want to make their countries stronger and their important industries better. This includes national safety, making sure supply chains are secure, and improving how well their industries can compete. China, for example, is focusing on building a complete semiconductor industry. It wants to make more and more of its own products over time. China's main way to do this is by using government money to help and support the industry's growth.</p>
            <p>In 2022, the US government passed the CHIPS Act. This law uses money to help the industry grow and gives companies a 25% tax break for investments. Mr. Huang pointed out that in August, the US government bought 9.9% of Intel's shares for about 8.9 billion US dollars. These shares do not allow them to vote.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang stated that the US is using a strategy similar to China's, where the government uses its money to get shares in important semiconductor companies. While the US government's involvement is not as strong as China's right now, it is expected that the US government will use more of its money to get involved in the industry's development in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang explained China's thinking behind its policies: if companies want to do business in the Chinese market, they need to build factories there. They also need to buy parts and services from local Chinese suppliers.</p>
            <p>Also, Mr. Huang said that since the US is a rival to China, China wants to control its own supply chain. First, it wants to reduce its reliance on American products and technology. Then, it wants to make everything itself. The long-term goal is to be fully independent. This means Chinese companies should control all important parts of the supply chain and key technologies, like advanced chip making, high-speed memory, and other important equipment and materials.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang stated that the current main goal of US policy is to make its own industries stronger. It wants semiconductor companies like TSMC and Samsung, whose main customers are American companies, to focus on the US market. These companies need to build factories in the US to serve American customers, and all their manufacturing investments must be in the US.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang explained that the US is not only working hard to reduce its reliance on China but also aiming to produce everything domestically. The US's long-term goal is for American companies to keep improving their technology and stay leaders in the industry. Because of this, the US treats investments by Intel differently from investments by foreign companies in the US.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang said that for many decades, the semiconductor industry has been divided into different specialized parts, like designing chips, making chips (foundries), and packaging and testing them. However, he now sees that the leading companies in the industry are moving back towards vertical integration, meaning they are doing more of these steps themselves.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang gave NVIDIA, a top AI chip company, as an example. He said NVIDIA used to be just a company that designed chips. But now, NVIDIA designs its own computer racks. This leaves very little room for other companies to make parts. NVIDIA also sells these racks directly to big businesses and offers cloud services. So, NVIDIA is no longer just a chip design company.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang pointed out that TSMC, which started by making chips for other companies, is now moving into advanced packaging like CoWoS and 3D packaging. This advanced packaging business is becoming more and more important for TSMC's earnings. Its business model is slowly moving towards vertical integration.</p>
            <p>As advanced packaging becomes more popular, Mr. Huang said that "chiplets" (small chips) are becoming a new area of specialization in the industry. On an advanced packaging platform, several different chiplets can be stacked together, either flat or vertically. It is expected that in the future, more and more chiplets will be added to these platforms, like building with blocks.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang believes that once chiplets become standardized in the future, they could turn into a market where different kinds of chiplets with different functions can be bought and sold. This will help advanced packaging grow even more and push the semiconductor industry forward.</p>

            <h1>North Taiwan Prepares for 38-Degree Heat, Expert Says Tropical Storm Tapah May Form Today</h1>
            <p>Mr. Wu De-rong, an expert in weather, said that it will be sunny everywhere today. Northern Taiwan will be very hot, with temperatures possibly reaching 38 degrees Celsius. A tropical low-pressure system south of Dongsha Island is moving northwest. It is expected to become a weak typhoon called "Tapah" today. It will hit the west side of China's Pearl River Delta on September 8 and will not affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration said that it will be very hot everywhere today. Taipei City and New Taipei City are under an orange warning, meaning there's a chance of extremely high temperatures of 38 degrees. Tainan City is also under an orange warning, meaning it might have 36-degree heat for several days. Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, Taichung City, Changhua County, and Yunlin County are under a yellow warning, meaning people should be careful of temperatures above 36 degrees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu De-rong, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his weather column that the latest path prediction from the Central Weather Administration shows a tropical low-pressure system south of Dongsha Island. It is moving northwest and is expected to become Tropical Storm Tapah today. On September 8, it will hit the western side of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong, China, but it will not affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu also said that the latest computer models from Europe (ECMWF) show that the storm's average path will go over the western side of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong. The fact that different models show slightly different paths means there is some uncertainty, so we need to keep watching it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu stated that the newest European model shows clear skies everywhere today. Northern Taiwan will be extremely hot, with temperatures reaching 38 degrees Celsius. Around noon, UV radiation will be at a dangerous level. He reminded people to use sunscreen and avoid getting heatstroke. He also mentioned that there might be some scattered showers or thunderstorms in the mountains and southern areas in the afternoon. As more moisture comes from the south, there is also a chance of rain in the Hengchun Peninsula and the Hualien-Taitung area.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, Mr. Wu said that today, the north is expected to be between 23 and 38 degrees Celsius. The central part will be 24 to 36 degrees. The south will be 25 to 37 degrees, and the east will be 22 to 35 degrees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu said that from September 7 to 9, Tropical Storm Tapah will be active in the South China Sea. During this time, clouds will increase slightly everywhere. Temperatures will drop a little, but northern Taiwan will still be quite hot. Because of the storm's outer moisture, there will be local rain in Hualien-Taitung and the Hengchun Peninsula. The air will be unstable, and strong thunderstorms will form in the mountains in the afternoon, spreading to some flat areas. People should be careful of heavy thunderstorms, which can bring lightning, strong winds, sudden heavy rain, and hail.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu also mentioned that there is still a chance of heavy thunderstorms in the afternoon on September 10. On September 11 and 12, the Pacific high-pressure system will get stronger. It will be sunny and hot everywhere. In the mountains, there might be some short local showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon, but they will not be strong and will cover a much smaller area.</p>

            <h1>Semiconductor Exhibition Opens September 10, SEMI Says More Countries Are Joining, Like an Industry Olympics</h1>
            <p>The SEMICON Taiwan international semiconductor exhibition will start on September 10. SEMI, the organization that hosts the event, announced that this year, more countries will take part. There will also be a wider variety of activities, making it like the "Olympics" for the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>SEMI said that this year's exhibition will focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI), cars, and robots. It will cover topics like AI chips, advanced packaging, 3D ICs, small chips (chiplets), fan-out panel level packaging, different types of integration, silicon photonics, quantum computing, high-bandwidth memory, global strategies, environmentally friendly manufacturing, training new workers, and cybersecurity. They expect more than 1,200 companies from 56 countries to use over 4,100 booths. About 100,000 visitors are expected to come, making it the biggest exhibition ever.</p>
            <p>SEMI stated that more countries are participating in this year's semiconductor exhibition than last year. New country areas have been added for Canada, Costa Rica, Lithuania, Sweden, and Vietnam. This means there will be a new record of 17 country pavilions. Many foreign groups will also attend, such as the US-Taiwan Business Council, the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology, a group of Italian lawmakers, and visitors from Chile and Guatemala.</p>
            <p>During the international semiconductor exhibition, there will also be many events for people to connect, like the Taiwan-Poland Business Forum, the Korea-Taiwan Semiconductor Supply Chain Economic Cooperation Forum, the Taiwan-Japan Technology Summit, and the Taiwan-India Semiconductor Forum. SEMI pointed out that this shows more and more countries want to be involved in the semiconductor industry. Also, countries want more help and chances to share ideas with Taiwan.</p>
            <p>SEMI said that this year, the exhibition will have more types of activities. Besides the usual exhibition, technical talks, and networking events, there will also be many other activities. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER), and the Center for Science, Democracy, and Society (DSET) will hold a forum about semiconductors and global politics.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and SEMI will together host the "Chip Chain Summit Forum." This forum will bring together company representatives from Japan, Europe, and the US to discuss how to work together as global supply chains are changing.</p>
            <p>SEMI has invited Dr. Chintay Shih, a former president of ITRI who helped develop Taiwan's semiconductor industry, to speak at the SEMI Rising Stars Award Ceremony and Technology Masters Forum. He will share his experience and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Mr. Frank Hou, the head of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association, and Mr. Tien Wu, the CEO of ASE Technology Holding, will lead a discussion. They will talk with Jim Keller, known as a "chip guru" in Silicon Valley, and Jochen Hanebeck, the CEO of Infineon. They will discuss how Taiwan can stay competitive in the semiconductor industry in the future, looking from both Taiwan's and a global point of view.</p>
            <p>Jim Keller is currently the CEO of Tenstorrent. He used to be a senior vice president for silicon engineering at Intel, vice president for self-driving cars at Tesla, and chief chip architect at AMD. He led the design of many chips that changed the world.</p>
            <p>Last year, the leaders of Samsung's memory business, Jung-Bae Lee, and SK Hynix, Justin Kim, came to Taiwan. This year, Micron, an American memory company, will also come. For the first time, top leaders from the three biggest memory companiesâ€”Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micronâ€”will all be on stage together.</p>
            <p>SEMI stated that with current global politics and changes in supply chains, competition and cooperation between regions around the world are changing. SEMICON Taiwan is a very important event that brings together all parts of the semiconductor industry, like the Olympics for the industry.</p>
