The United States might cancel special permissions that allow global chipmakers to send American technology to China. This action could significantly impact certain chip companies, especially those dealing with advanced technology for AI and data centers. If these waivers are removed, major companies with large sales in China, such as Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, could see a decrease in their income. This move would intensify the technology competition between the US and China, pushing chipmakers to change their supply chains and business plans.

**Tencent Music Shares Double on Break From China Price Cut Script**
