            <h1>Volunteer Soldier Allowance Not Budgeted; Chiu Kuo-cheng Hopes for Agreement Between Government and Legislature</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 26 (CNA) The 2026 central government budget does not include two items: salary adjustments for soldiers and retirement rules for police and firefighters. This has caused discussion. Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said today that the Ministry of National Defense follows the Executive Yuan's guidance, based on the principle of administrative unity. There is no agreement between the government and the legislature on increasing the allowance for volunteer soldiers to NT$30,000. He hopes for discussions to reach a consensus.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai led heads of relevant ministries to the Legislative Yuan to report on the 2025 additional budget proposal and answer questions. Chiu Kuo-cheng made the above statement before the meeting.</p>
            <p>Regarding the Legislative Yuan's approval of a soldier pay raise that was not included in the total budget by the Executive Yuan, Chiu Kuo-cheng said that based on the principle of administrative unity, the Ministry of National Defense acts according to the Executive Yuan's instructions. There is no agreement between the government and the legislature on raising the volunteer soldier allowance to NT$30,000. He hopes that an agreement can be reached through constitutional interpretation or other methods. If there is an agreement later, it will be handled according to the Executive Yuan's guidance.</p>
            <p>When asked by the media what "other methods" meant and if not including the budget was illegal, Chiu Kuo-cheng said that the government and legislature have not yet agreed and hope to discuss it.</p>
            <p>Chiu Kuo-cheng pointed out that preparing the budget is the Executive Yuan's responsibility. The Ministry of National Defense, based on administrative unity, respects and accepts the Executive Yuan's overall considerations regarding whether to include the budget, based on fairness and national finances.</p>
            <p>Chiu Kuo-cheng said that facing a serious threat, Taiwan must show its will for self-defense and increase its defense budget. President Lai Ching-te promised to reach 3% of GDP. For this, the defense budget includes three main parts: personnel costs, operational costs, and military investments. These three should be balanced and not neglected. The Executive Yuan supports a 20.1% increase in the annual budget, and in the future, it will continue to improve soldier welfare and care, speed up weapon and equipment procurement, ensure proper equipment maintenance, and refine training. Salary increases will also be reviewed and adjusted step by step.</p>
            <p>Chiu Kuo-cheng stated that one of President Lai's important instructions for the Ministry of National Defense is to improve soldiers' pay, including benefits for soldiers and their families, so that soldiers can carry out their mission of defending the country with honor. In fact, in April, June, and July of this year, the Ministry of National Defense increased allowances for volunteer soldiers, combat unit allowances, cyber warfare allowances, electronic reconnaissance allowances, and air traffic control allowances. The Ministry of National Defense will continue to plan adjustments to allowances based on needed skills, mission types, and danger levels within the forces.</p>
            <p>In addition, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) unusually announced its meeting with Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng yesterday, which caused discussion. Chiu Kuo-cheng repeated that Taiwan-U.S. military exchanges always aim to maintain peace and stability in the region. Exchanges with AIT are part of Taiwan-U.S. military exchanges. Besides AIT, he will continue to communicate closely with U.S. executive and legislative branches. As for the content of the talks with AIT, it will not be made public as usual, based on mutual understanding.</p>
            <p>In June this year, the Legislative Yuan passed amendments to parts of the Military Personnel Remuneration Act, setting the monthly allowance for volunteer soldiers in the national army at NT$30,000. This is an increase of over NT$10,000 from the current volunteer allowance, which ranges from NT$13,000 to NT$15,000. It will be effective from January 1 next year.</p>

            <h1>Getting Ready for the New School Year: Washington D.C. Immigrant Communities Worry About Deportation Orders Affecting School Children</h1>
            <p>Washington (CNA) As public schools in Washington D.C. start their new school year today, neighbors, volunteers, and parents are busy taking children to school. They are determined to protect these students from the effects of U.S. President Trump's orders to deport undocumented immigrants.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, groups have been formed across Washington D.C. to escort children, arrange carpools, and organize patrols. This is due to worries that immigration officers might increase arrests and raids, possibly targeting school campuses.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stated that they will not target Washington D.C. schools for raids today. However, they did not rule out safety checks on undocumented and unaccompanied children inside school campuses. The Trump administration says these children need to be saved from human trafficking and forced labor.</p>
            <p>Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told NBC News last week: "You will not see ICE officers conducting raids or large-scale sweeps on August 25. But our goal is to find those 300,000 undocumented children and those minors who came here during the last administration."</p>
            <p>Selene, a Mexican-American community organizer, admitted she thought about not sending her daughter to school. This is because even Latino families who legally live in the U.S. have been targeted for detention and crackdown.</p>
            <p>Selene, who did not want to share her last name, said: "It's not about your identity. It's about how you look, right? When you walk down the street and you look Latino, unfortunately, you become a target."</p>
            <p>According to data from the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, there were about 25,000 undocumented immigrants in Washington D.C. in 2023.</p>
            <p>Even though public schools in Washington D.C. do not collect information about students' citizenship status, a 2022 Washington Post report, citing estimates from D.C. Council members, stated that Washington D.C. public schools "have 3,000 to 4,000 undocumented students."</p>
            <p>According to the National Education Association, in California, which has the largest immigrant population in the U.S., student absences have greatly increased since ICE raids started again after Trump returned to the White House in January this year.</p>
            <p>Jeffrey Freitas, president of the California Federation of Teachers, referred to an important Supreme Court ruling from 1982. This ruling states that states cannot stop undocumented children from attending public schools.</p>
            <p>Lora Ries from the conservative think tank "Heritage Foundation" pointed out: "According to the Supreme Court ruling, regardless of a child's immigration status, they can attend public schools without risk." But she added: "If someone is living illegally, they should follow the law."</p>

            <h1>Former Rung Chih Paper Employee Accused of Leaking Secrets; Taipei Prosecutors Charge Him Under Trade Secrets Act</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 26 (CNA) A quality control employee named Wang, from the listed company "Rung Chih Paper," is accused of illegally copying company secrets, like industrial paper raw material formulas, using Chinese software before leaving his job. He then went to work for a competing company, Yong Feng Yu. Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office charged him with breaking the Trade Secrets Act.</p>
            <p>According to the indictment from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, Mr. Wang used to work as a quality control manager for industrial paper at Rung Chih Paper's industrial paper R&D chemical institute. His duties included managing material composition, calculating costs, and doing special project research. He also signed a confidentiality agreement with the company.</p>
            <p>The indictment says that between August and November 2024, Mr. Wang illegally installed Chinese software like "Baidu Wangpan" and "Baidu Cloud Manager" on his company laptop. He then copied company secrets, such as industrial paper quality control project files and raw material formulas. At the end of November of the same year, he left to work for Yong Feng Yu, a competing company.</p>
            <p>After finding something unusual, Rung Chih Company reported it to the police. When questioned, Mr. Wang denied the accusations. He said he only sent the information to other Rung Chih employees, not copied or reproduced company secrets. However, his explanation was not accepted.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors believe Mr. Wang committed the crimes of reproducing trade secrets without permission or beyond his authorized scope under the Trade Secrets Act, and breach of trust under the Criminal Code. They asked the court to punish him more severely under the Trade Secrets Act. He was charged today.</p>
