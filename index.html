<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-sees-asian-tech-stocks-034043507.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- Asian technology stocks may rally another 15%-20% this year, driven mainly by the strong momentum in the artificial intelligence space, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.

‚ÄúAI will continue to lead this upcycle on the growth in datacenter capex in 2025 and more confidence in 2026 growth,‚Äù analysts including Gokul Hariharan wrote in a report. ‚ÄúWe are not advising any meaningful rotation away from AI stocks in the next three months and would prefer‚Äù to stick with the winners.

AI stocks are rapidly emerging as pivotal drivers of the region‚Äôs equity markets, underpinned by a robust domestic appetite for automation and generative technology. A Bloomberg regional semiconductor index has risen over 12% this year to outperform an Asian equity gauge, and resilient demand for AI memory chips from big tech providers may drive further gains.

JPMorgan‚Äôs top stock picks include the region‚Äôs largest chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., SK Hynix Inc., Advantest Corp and Delta Electronics Inc. Those shares should continue their upward momentum in the next 12 months, as demand is not an issue and earnings will continue to be revised up, they wrote.

The bank is more cautious on non-AI stocks, such as makers of personal computers, smartphones and consumer devices. Earnings downward revisions may continue as the impact of China consumption subsidies fades, the report added.

**Taiwan's China Airlines Postpones Retirement of Older Planes Due to Boeing 787 Delays**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-china-airlines-postpones-retirement-051339368.html">News Link</a>

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - China Airlines, Taiwan's national carrier, is delaying the retirement of some of its older aircraft. This is because Boeing has been slow in delivering new 787-9 jets. The airline's newly appointed chairman suggested that Boeing might have to pay compensation for these delays.

China Airlines, founded in 1959, is currently updating its fleet. Last year, the airline ordered new long-haul planes, worth nearly $12 billion, from both Boeing and Airbus. China Airlines also ordered 24 Boeing 787s, including 18 787-9s and six of the larger 787-10s, for regional and some longer routes.

Chairman George Kao stated that the plan to replace older Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s with 787-9s and A321neos is affected by slow deliveries, especially for the 787-9s. "We are currently very affected. Some aircraft that were planned to be retired, or returned at the end of their lease, will remain and have their leases extended," he told Reuters during an interview at the airline's headquarters in Taoyuan, Taiwan's main international airport.

Boeing has not given China Airlines a firm date for the 787-9 delays, but has indicated that deliveries will "basically" start by the end of 2025. Kao, who began his career as a flight attendant and became chairman in March, added that the contract includes provisions for compensation if Boeing is responsible for the delays, such as issues in the supply chain. Boeing did not comment on the matter.

Other airlines are experiencing similar problems. Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), recently called the predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade "unacceptable."

Despite these issues, Kao remains positive about expansion. He mentioned that the more fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s ordered last year will allow for more flights to destinations like New York and London. He also noted that a new third terminal at Taoyuan airport is expected to open its first section later this year, which will greatly improve the travel experience.

Kao also hinted at adding more aircraft for Mandarin Airlines, a subsidiary that mostly flies domestic routes with ATR-72 turboprops. Mandarin Airlines is being restructured to focus on regional routes from southern and central Taiwan with new jet aircraft. He stated that discussions with aircraft lessors are underway to support Mandarin Airlines' growth.

China Airlines faces competition from long-standing rival EVA Air and the rapidly expanding Starlux Airlines, which recently ordered 10 more A350s. Kao believes that while Taiwan's local market is small, transit traffic, which all three airlines are targeting, is sufficient to support three full-service airlines. He highlighted Taoyuan airport's convenient location for connecting the Pacific to Asia, and its advantages over other regional hubs like Seoul's Incheon (too large), Tokyo (expensive landing fees), and Hong Kong (political issues).

**Masa Son Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-pitches-1-trillion-us-053937697.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is seeking to team up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to realize what could be his biggest bet yet ‚Äî a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona to build robots and artificial intelligence.

Son envisions a version of the vast manufacturing hub of China‚Äôs Shenzhen that would bring back high-tech manufacturing to the US, according to people familiar with the billionaire‚Äôs thinking. The park may comprise production lines for AI-powered industrial robots, they said, asking not to be named as the plan remains private.

SoftBank officials are keen to have the Taiwanese maker of Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs advanced AI chips play a prominent role in the project, although it‚Äôs not clear what part Son sees for TSMC, which already plans to invest $165 billion in the US and has started mass production at its first Arizona factory. Nor is it clear that TSMC would be interested. A person familiar with the chipmaker‚Äôs thinking said that SoftBank‚Äôs project has no bearing on TSMC‚Äôs plans in Phoenix.

Shares of SoftBank jumped as much as 2.3% in Tokyo Friday. TSMC‚Äôs stock price rose 1.9% in Taipei.

Codenamed ‚ÄúProject Crystal Land,‚Äù the Arizona complex represents the 67-year-old SoftBank chief‚Äôs most ambitious attempt in a career that‚Äôs spanned numerous bet-the-house bids, thousands-fold-returns and billions of dollars in losses. Son, who‚Äôs often expressed disappointment in his own legacy, has repeatedly said he means to do everything he can to hurry AI development.

SoftBank officials have spoken with federal and state government officials to discuss possible tax breaks for companies building factories or otherwise investing in the industrial park, including talks with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the people said.

The Japanese billionaire is also personally sounding out interest among an array of tech companies, they said. The project has been floated to executives at South Korea‚Äôs Samsung Electronics Co., they said.

Representatives of SoftBank, TSMC and Samsung declined to comment. A Commerce Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Son has pulled together a list of SoftBank Vision Fund portfolio companies that might take part in the Arizona manufacturing hub, the people said. SoftBank-backed startups working on robotics and automation technologies ‚Äî such as Agile Robots SE ‚Äî may set up production facilities at the industrial complex, they said.

The plans are preliminary and feasibility hinges on support from the Trump administration and state officials. While the cost of the project as envisioned by Son may require as much as $1 trillion to execute ‚Äî a sum previously reported by the Nikkei ‚Äî the actual scale depends on interest from big technology companies. If successful, Son has floated building multiple cutting-edge industrial parks across the US.

SoftBank is exploring the Arizona project as it also moves forward on plans to invest as much as $30 billion into OpenAI and plans a $6.5 billion acquisition of Ampere Computing LLC. It‚Äôs also seeding money into the Stargate venture with OpenAI, Oracle Corp. and Abu Dhabi‚Äôs MGX, seeking to ferry hundreds of billions of dollars into data centers and related infrastructure around the world.

Those outlays come as SoftBank‚Äôs cash stood at ¬•3.4 trillion ($23 billion) at the end of March. The Tokyo-based company has since tapped its T-Mobile US Inc. stake, selling roughly a quarter of what it held in March to raise $4.8 billion this month. SoftBank also has net assets valued at ¬•25.7 trillion, of which chip designer Arm Holdings Plc makes the single largest portion, allowing it to borrow billions more as needed.

SoftBank‚Äôs exploring project financing for Stargate data centers, a model that could be adapted to a big endeavor like Crystal Land. Common for large-scale infrastructure like oil or gas pipelines, the project finance template would allow the tech investor to raise funding on a project-by-project basis and require less money upfront.

Son‚Äôs restless search for growth has resulted in projects that proceed in fits and starts, making it difficult to gauge how committed he is to any one venture. The billionaire is often goaded by the desire to boost SoftBank‚Äôs stock price and repay retail investors who‚Äôve held onto the company‚Äôs shares from before the dot-com boom and bust, people close to the SoftBank chief have said. Many investors have waited for decades for the stock to regain dot-com bubble levels ‚Äî something it‚Äôs flirted with only a few times since 2020.

If Son‚Äôs primary motivation is to clear the way for AI, it may be more cost-efficient to encourage partnerships that link manufacturing expertise with that of AI engineers and specialists in fields from medicine to robotics, and incubating smaller companies, according to Melissa Otto, head of research at Visible Alpha.

But pouring cash into data centers may help lower the cost of developing AI applications and spur broader adoption, she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a long-term thinker, and he takes risks,‚Äù Otto said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too early to tell.‚Äù
