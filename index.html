            <h1>Eastern Regional Conference of US State Governments Supports Taiwan's International Role</h1>
            <p>The yearly meeting of the "Eastern Regional Conference of the Council of State Governments" took place in Providence, Rhode Island. Today, a resolution supporting Taiwan was passed. This resolution is against China using a United Nations resolution (UN General Assembly Resolution 2758) in the wrong way.</p>
            <p>The Eastern Regional Conference of the Council of State Governments met from August 17 to 20 in Providence, the capital city of Rhode Island. More than 500 people attended, including state lawmakers, government representatives, and business people.</p>
            <p>The resolution that supports Taiwan states that UN Resolution 2758 does not talk about Taiwan's status. It also does not stop Taiwan from being part of the UN system. China purposely misreads this resolution and uses it like a weapon. China tries to make Taiwan alone and stop Taiwan from joining international groups in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p>The resolution also says that the partnership between Taiwan and the United States is strong and close. They share democratic values. It supports quickly signing an agreement to avoid double taxation. It also supports continuing talks for the "Taiwan-US 21st Century Trade Initiative." The resolution encourages states in the US to open new offices or make their current offices in Taiwan bigger. It also encourages signing agreements for people to easily exchange their driving licenses without tests. These actions will make trade and economic ties, as well as education exchanges, between the two sides even stronger.</p>
            <p>Liao Chao-hung, who is in charge of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Boston, first thanked the state parliaments for showing their support for Taiwan through these resolutions. He said that the support from these states is a very important base for the Taiwan-US relationship to keep getting stronger. It also gives people in Taiwan more belief and bravery to protect democracy.</p>
            <p>Liao Chao-hung thanked past US governments for giving help with defense based on the Taiwan Relations Act. He said Taiwan is leading the effort to protect democracy around the world. Taiwan faces constant military threats, economic pressure, fake news, and China's incorrect reading of UN Resolution 2758. These are all part of China's "gray zone tactics." The Taiwanese government will continue to make its defense and social strength better. It will work with other democratic countries to protect peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait together.</p>
            <p>The Eastern Regional Conference of the Council of State Governments started in 1937 and is based in New York. It includes 11 states in the eastern US, 2 US territories, and 5 Canadian provinces. Its goal is to encourage communication between state governments, businesses, and schools. It also aims to make government better and improve democracy.</p>
            <p>The Executive Committee meeting on August 17 was led by the conference co-chairs, Rhode Island State Senate President Valarie Lawson and House Speaker Joseph Shekarchi. Almost 100 leaders and officials from different state parliaments attended, including the association's national chairman, Illinois State Senator Elgie Sims.</p>

            <h1>Trump: Will Arrange Putin-Zelenskyy Meeting, Followed by US-Ukraine-Russia Summit</h1>
            <p>President Trump had a very busy and closely watched day today. After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, several European leaders also joined the meeting. In the evening, Trump announced that he called Russian President Vladimir Putin after the meeting. He has started to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy. After that, a summit with the US, Ukraine, and Russia will happen to end the war.</p>
            <p>Today, President Trump met separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House. After the meetings, he wrote on social media that the meetings were "very good." Everyone talked about how to keep Ukraine safe. These safety promises will come from several European countries, working with the United States.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "After the meeting, I called (Russian) President Putin and started to arrange a meeting between President Putin and Zelenskyy. The place is still not decided. After that meeting, we will have a three-way meeting with both presidents and me."</p>
            <p>He said that these plans are very good first steps for a war that has been going on for almost four years. Vice President JD Vance, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and special envoy Steve Witkoff are now working with Russia and Ukraine on these matters.</p>
            <p>In this social media post, besides Zelenskyy meeting Putin, the most important part is "security guarantees." This afternoon, when Trump met with Zelenskyy, he also told the media that any agreement after the war would "give a lot of help" for safety. But he said that Europe would be the "first line of defense," and the US would also help.</p>
            <p>Trump did not clearly answer if US soldiers would stay in Ukraine to keep the peace. He only said, "Maybe I'll tell you later today."</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Trump Suddenly Changes Plans, Calls Putin During Meeting with European Leaders</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump had a private meeting at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders. Reuters reported, citing a European Union diplomat, that Trump suddenly stopped his meeting with the European leaders to call Russian President Vladimir Putin. Originally, the call to Putin was supposed to happen after the meeting.</p>
            <p>Trump met with Zelenskyy around 1 PM this afternoon. He told the reporters there, "I like the idea of a ceasefire."</p>
            <p>However, Trump also said, "We can work towards a peace agreement while they (Russia and Ukraine) continue fighting." He pointed out that some peace agreements in the past did not require a ceasefire first.</p>
            <p>Trump did not give a direct answer when asked if US troops would stay in Ukraine to keep peace. He only said, "Maybe I'll tell you later today."</p>
            <p>He said that after his meetings today with Zelenskyy and several European leaders, he would call Putin. A meeting between Trump and Putin had just happened three days ago at a US military base in Alaska. This made today's talks at the White House even more important to watch.</p>
            <p>But Reuters reported in the afternoon that Trump stopped his meeting with Zelenskyy and leaders from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the European Commission, and NATO. He did this to talk with Putin.</p>
            <p>Later, Zelenskyy's spokesperson told CNN that Trump's meeting with the European leaders started again in the White House Oval Office. It was a "leaders only" meeting.</p>
