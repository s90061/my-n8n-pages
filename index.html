        const text = `**Musk Should Stay Out of Politics, Says US Treasury Secretary**

One day after billionaire Elon Musk announced he was starting a new political party, the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, said that Musk should focus on his businesses. An investment company, Azoria Partners, also delayed the launch of a new fund that invests in Musk's company, Tesla. They said that Musk starting a political party conflicts with his full-time job as a CEO.

Musk announced his new party, the "America Party," because he doesn't agree with former President Trump's tax and spending plan, which Musk thinks will make the US go bankrupt. Bessent said that the boards of Tesla and SpaceX probably don't like Musk getting involved in politics. He believes they will tell him to focus on his work.

The White House did not directly respond to Musk's new party. However, they said that the approval of Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" shows that the Republican Party is strong. A White House spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said that President Trump has made the Republican Party strong and united in a new way.

**US Treasury Secretary: Several Trade Deals Coming Soon**

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced today that the US is close to making several trade deals. This comes before the deadline for new tariffs on July 9th. He also said that some big announcements will be made in the next few days.

Bessent explained that President Trump will send letters to 100 countries that don't trade much with the US. These letters will tell them that they will face higher tariffs, which were first set on April 2nd and then delayed until July 9th. Bessent said he expects many deals to be made soon.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has started trade conflicts around the world. This has made other countries work hard to protect their economies, including trying to make deals with the US and other countries. On April 2nd, Trump announced a basic tariff of 10% and added more tariffs for most countries, some as high as 50%. But these extra tariffs were paused for 90 days to give countries time to talk and sign agreements. During this time, only the basic 10% tariff was applied.

Bessent said that August 1st is not a new deadline for talks. He said it's when the new tariffs will start. He added that if countries want to move faster, they should, but if they choose to go back to the original tariff rates, that's their choice.

Kevin Hassett, who leads the White House National Economic Council, said that the US is always willing to talk about global trade issues. He admitted that there are deadlines, and some are very close, so some situations might be delayed past the original date. He noted that President Trump will decide if delays are possible.

**Typhoon Tapah: Taipei Extends Parking by Floodgates**

Due to Typhoon Tapah, the Taipei City Department of Transportation announced near midnight on July 7th that they are extending the time people can park on red and yellow lines near certain floodgates. This applies to parts of Zhongshan, Songshan, Shilin, Wanhua, and Datong districts. Cars must be moved by 12:00 PM on July 7th.

The Department of Transportation sent out a press release with this information. They warned that if people don't move their cars, the cars will be towed, and the owners will have to pay a fine. Also, parking fees will start again for those spaces.

The department explained that the Central Weather Administration predicts that Taipei will not have strong enough winds or enough rain on July 7th to stop work or school. So, work and school will be normal on July 7th. The Hydraulic Engineering Office looked at the typhoon's path and water levels and decided to open all floodgates and riverside roads for normal traffic at 11:00 PM on July 6th. The parking extension is to give people enough time to move their cars.
