            <h1>UK Ambassador to US Removed for Being Close Friend of Sex Offender Epstein</h1>
            <p>The Prime Minister of the UK, Keir Starmer, removed Peter Mandelson, the British Ambassador to the United States, today. This happened because new letters showed that Mandelson was very close friends with Jeffrey Epstein, a rich American who committed sex crimes and has now passed away.</p>
            <p>Mandelson was called "Prince of Darkness" when he worked in media. He had to leave his jobs in Tony Blair's government twice, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, because of bad actions.</p>
            <p>This removal of Mandelson causes big political and diplomatic problems for Starmer. He is trying to make his government stronger again, and next week, the US President Donald Trump will visit.</p>
            <p>This is the second important person to leave the British government in one week. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner left her job on September 5th because she did not pay enough property tax.</p>
            <p>The Prime Minister's office said that Starmer asked the Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, to remove Mandelson. This was after emails Mandelson wrote to Epstein became public. These emails were sent after Epstein was found guilty of crimes.</p>
            <p>A statement said: "The emails show that Mandelson's relationship with Epstein was much deeper and wider than people knew when he was chosen for the job."</p>
            <p>"Because of this, and thinking about the people who were hurt by Epstein's crimes, Mandelson's job as Ambassador has been taken away immediately."</p>
            <p>According to the BBC, Mandelson wrote a letter to the embassy staff. In it, he said that being the Ambassador was "the greatest honor of my life."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg had earlier reported that Mandelson sent encouraging messages to Epstein in 2008. This was when Epstein was being investigated for sex crimes in the US. In his email, Mandelson told Epstein that he would follow the case closely and "always be ready to help."</p>
            <p>It was also reported that Mandelson suggested Epstein "try to get out of jail early." This was just before Epstein admitted to getting underage girls for sex and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.</p>
            <p>Mandelson, who was a former Labour minister and a European trade official, even wrote the day before Epstein went to jail: "I value you greatly."</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Starmer said that Starmer "clearly thought the content of these emails was wrong." But the spokesperson said it was not a mistake that Starmer chose Mandelson less than a year ago. "The Prime Minister acted quickly and strongly," the spokesperson said.</p>
            <p>After the news was published, Mandelson, 71, told the BBC that he believed Epstein was innocent at the time. "His lawyers said it was a trap and a criminal plan. I foolishly believed them, and I am very sorry for it now," he said.</p>
            <p>Some government ministers said Mandelson's emails made them "feel sick." Others called the emails "very troubling and disgusting." After this, Mandelson's job was in danger. Many Labour members of parliament publicly asked Starmer to fire Mandelson. Now, some people are asking Mandelson to leave his seat in the House of Lords.</p>
            <p>This experienced politician became the Ambassador to the US earlier this year. His job was to build a strong relationship with President Trump. But in 2003, Mandelson had written letters calling Epstein a "close friend" and "smart and clever." After these letters became public, it was clear Mandelson would lose his job.</p>

            <h1>Trump to Give Medal to Ally Kirk, Who Was Killed, During 9/11 Ceremony</h1>
            <p>Charlie Kirk, an important friend of US President Donald Trump, was killed. Today, during a ceremony for the 9/11 attacks, Trump said he will give Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom after his death. It is also known that Vice President JD Vance went to visit Kirk's family. Vance will take Kirk's body back to Arizona.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Charlie Kirk, a writer and podcast host, helped the Republican Party get more support from young voters. On September 10th, he was shot and killed while giving a speech at Utah Valley University in Utah. He was 31 years old. Trump said it was a "terrible murder."</p>
            <p>CNBC, an American news channel, reported that Trump announced today at a 9/11 memorial event at the Pentagon that he will give Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This is the highest award for a civilian in the United States.</p>
            <p>Trump began his speech by saying: "Before we start, I want to say that the American people are shocked and sad about the cruel murder of Kirk. Charlie was a great person among his generation, a defender of freedom, and he inspired many, many people."</p>
            <p>When talking about giving the award, Trump said the date is not set yet, but "I can promise one thing: there will be very, very many people."</p>
            <p>US Vice President JD Vance was a close friend of Kirk for many years.</p>
            <p>Politico, a political news group, reported that Vance cancelled his plan to go to the 9/11 memorial event in New York today. Instead, he and his wife, Usha Vance, went to Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
            <p>People who know about the situation said that Vance plans to use a special plane, "Air Force Two," to take Kirk's body, Kirk's wife, and some family and friends back to Kirk's home in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
            <p>Investigators said today that they have found a bolt-action rifle that they think was used to kill Kirk. They also showed a picture of a suspect. They are still looking for the shooter, who they say is about college age.</p>
            <p>When the shooting happened, Kirk was hosting an outdoor discussion called "Prove Me Wrong" on the Utah Valley University campus. About 3,000 people were there. The FBI and state officials said the shooter came onto the campus a few minutes before the event began.</p>
            <p>Police said at a press conference that security cameras showed this person walking up stairs to the roof. Then, they shot Kirk. The bullet hit Kirk's neck. At that time, Kirk, who strongly supported the right to own guns, was answering questions about mass shootings. The people watching ran away in fear.</p>
            <p>FBI agent Robert Bohls told reporters that the shooter jumped off the roof after the crime and ran into a nearby neighborhood.</p>
            <p>Investigators found a powerful bolt-action rifle in a wooded area near where the crime happened. They are checking for fingerprints and footprints. The school was closed today, and the campus was empty. The roof of the building where the shooting happened and the nearby woods were blocked off with yellow tape for investigators to keep looking for evidence.</p>
            <p>Beau Mason, the Utah Commissioner of Public Safety, told reporters that the shooter looked like a college student and "fit in completely" with the school environment.</p>
            <p>The FBI has released a blurry picture from a security camera. In the picture, the "suspect" is wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, black sunglasses, and a dark baseball cap. The shirt seems to have a bald eagle with open wings flying above an American flag.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that there appear to be messages carved into the ammunition found by investigators. Sources close to the investigation told Reuters that the messages and their meaning are still being studied.</p>
