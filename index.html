            <h1>Driver Seen Holding Child While Driving, Causing Tunnel Traffic Jam; Police Say Fine Up To NT$36,000</h1>
            <p>Someone recently saw a driver on National Highway No. 5. They were surprised to see the driver in the car next to them, who seemed to have a small girl sitting on their lap while driving. This person wrote online that this driver caused the traffic jam in the Xuefeng Tunnel. The police said this way of driving is clearly against the rules and can lead to a fine of up to NT$36,000.</p>
            <p>On July 26th at noon, a person posted a 13-second video on the social media app Threads. It showed a light blue hatchback car in the next lane. A young girl seemed to be sitting on the driver's lap, facing the driver. The person who posted wrote, "The whole Xuefeng Tunnel is stuck because of you. What is this, driving with a child in your arms? Should I report you? I'm so angry I had to post this on Threads."</p>
            <p>Other people commented that it was already very bad that the child was not in a car safety seat, and it was even worse that she was in the driver's seat. Another person said, "Don't drive like that and put others in danger." However, some people thought the child might have been crying in the car, and the driver had no choice, but they also agreed it was still very dangerous.</p>
            <p>The Ninth Brigade of the National Highway Police said today that they have not received any reports about this case yet. They said that even though the driver's actions are clearly against the rules, there is no clear date or time for when this happened, and it's hard to tell the exact place. They suggest that people can add more information and send the video to the National Highway Police Bureau's reporting section.</p>
            <p>The Ninth Brigade explained that this driver's illegal behavior can be punished based on the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act. Drivers who drive in other dangerous ways can be fined between NT$6,000 and NT$36,000. They will also be stopped from driving right away. If this causes an accident, their driver's license will be taken away.</p>

            <h1>TSMC: Public Roads Outside Chiayi Plant Are Getting Better After Flooding; Factory Area Is Fine</h1>
            <p>Due to heavy rain from a low-pressure system, Chiayi County stopped work and school on July 28th. TSMC said that the building area for contractors in Chiayi stopped work today. Staff for preventing problems are ready at the site, and they have finished checking all the steps to prevent damage. Some public roads outside the building area have collected water, and workers are pumping out the water and fixing the roads now. The factory area itself is completely fine.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration warned about heavy rain. A low-pressure system and winds from the southwest can easily bring short periods of very heavy rain. Chiayi County and other areas today have heavy or very heavy rain in some places. Taibao City, Lucao Township, Shuishang Township, Puzi City, Liujiao Township, and Xingang Township have all reported water flooding. People are worried if TSMC's advanced packaging factory in Chiayi is affected.</p>
            <p>TSMC said that the building area given to contractors in Chiayi stopped work today. This was done according to the Chiayi County Government's rule about stopping work and school due to natural disasters. Staff for preventing problems are ready at the site. They have also finished checking for disasters, like making sure water drains are clear and preparing water pumps. They also took down temporary things that could catch a lot of wind, like safety nets and fences.</p>
            <p>TSMC explained that because there was a lot of rain, some public roads outside the factory area have collected water. They are currently pumping out the water and fixing the roads. The factory's ground is built higher than the roads, so the factory area is fine. TSMC will keep watching the rain and take steps to prevent disasters. This is to make sure people and the area are safe and reduce any possible dangers.</p>
