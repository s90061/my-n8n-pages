            <h1>Taichung Man Suspected of Attacking 2 People with a Knife Due to Neighbor's Noise; Prosecutor Requests Detention for Attempted Murder</h1>
            <p>A man named Lin in Taichung is thought to have attacked two people with a knife. He was angry about noise from his neighbor, Ms. Chen. Today, he went to talk to her with a fruit knife, and they started to argue. Mr. Shi, who works at a car repair shop nearby, came to stop the fight. Mr. Lin then used the knife to hurt both of them. The police arrested him. After looking into the case, the prosecutor has asked to keep Mr. Lin in custody for trying to kill someone.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office said today that Mr. Lin was taken to the prosecutor's office this evening. After the prosecutor asked him questions, they decided that Mr. Lin likely committed serious crimes like hurting people and trying to kill them. They also think he might try to run away.</p>
            <p>Also, in 2023, Mr. Lin had used a fruit knife to hurt neighbors before and a court had already made a decision about it. Because of this past event, the prosecutor believes he might hurt or try to kill people again. So, the prosecutor thinks it is necessary to keep him in custody and has asked the Taichung District Court to do so.</p>
            <p>At 1:50 PM today, the Taichung City Fire Bureau received a report. Someone had been cut with a knife inside a house on Zhongzheng Road in Wufeng District. Emergency workers and ambulances quickly went to the place. They took the two injured people to Asia University Hospital for treatment.</p>
            <p>The Wufeng Police Station in Taichung City investigated the case. Mr. Lin, who is 23 years old, said that his 70-year-old neighbor, Ms. Chen, had her TV too loud. When the incident happened, he went to argue with her, holding a fruit knife. They began to fight loudly. Mr. Shi, a 70-year-old man from a nearby car repair shop, heard the argument and came to stop them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin then got very angry and used the fruit knife to hurt the two people. Mr. Shi was stabbed in his left chest. It seems his organs, like his lungs, might be damaged, and he lost a lot of blood. He was moved from Asia University Hospital to China Medical University Hospital for urgent help. Ms. Chen had stab wounds on the back of her left neck and on her forehead. She is being treated and watched at Asia University Hospital.</p>
            <p>After the crime, Mr. Lin went back to his home alone. The police arrived and arrested him. They also found the knife outside Ms. Chen's house. After the police questioned him, Mr. Lin was sent to the prosecutor for crimes such as hurting people and trying to kill them.</p>

            <h1>Sexual Harassment Allegation Was a Misunderstanding, Chiu Chen-yuan: We Have Settled, I Choose to Forgive</h1>
            <p>Chiu Chen-yuan, who is the acting mayor of Hsinchu City, was accused of sexual harassment two years ago. The accusation came from a woman who used to be an assistant to a politician from the Taiwan People's Party. Today, the woman said that "the accusation was truly a misunderstanding." Mr. Chiu Chen-yuan also wrote online to say that they have settled the matter. He said that the truth is now clear, and "when faced with harm, I choose to forgive."</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiu Chen-yuan posted a message on his Facebook page this evening. He explained that for two years, because of the false sexual harassment accusation, he and his family felt a lot of stress and were misunderstood. He faced attacks in politics and strong public opinion. He decided to trust the law and the truth.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiu Chen-yuan said that after following all the legal steps and talking with each other, "Ms. Wu Futong officially settled the issue with me on October 14, 2025. Then, on October 16, 2025, she made a public announcement on her Facebook page. She confirmed that her earlier accusation was a misunderstanding. She also took down the social media post that made the false accusation. And she published an announcement to clear my good name." Mr. Chiu's post included her statement from Facebook.</p>
            <p>He also said, "When faced with harm, I choose to forgive." He believes that being sensible and forgiving can help heal bad feelings and bring people together more.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiu Chen-yuan shared that for him, being innocent is not just about his own good name. It also means explaining everything clearly to his family, colleagues, people who support him, and the citizens of Hsinchu. He hopes that friends who care about this will also let go of what happened before. He wants them to focus again on Hsinchu City. In the future, he will keep working on city matters with a more humble and focused approach.</p>
