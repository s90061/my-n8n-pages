            <h1>Eric Chu Criticizes Supporters for Thinking About Copying Nazis, Calls It a Great Disrespect to Victims</h1>
            <p>Eric Chu, the head of the Kuomintang (KMT) party, said today that the ruling party's supporters are thinking about using the word 'Nazi' as a political tool. They want to use it to punish people who disagree and stop them from speaking freely. Mr. Chu said these people do not want to warn others. They want to fight and stir up trouble. They are not thinking carefully about what they are doing. He called this a very bad copy of democracy and a deep disrespect to people who suffered in the past.</p>
            <p>On August 3rd, an online personality named Chen Bo-yuan said that another online personality, Bajiong, secretly talked about 'studying how Nazis controlled crowds to oppose communism' and 'creating Nazi stormtroopers to start a revolution.' This caused a lot of discussion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chu wrote on Facebook this afternoon that if we let hate be controlled, everyone will lose freedom in society. He said the Republic of China's democracy is something everyone is proud of. It is also a value that the KMT always protects. He strongly believes that a healthy society can accept many different opinions. A good democracy should also value talking about different ideas.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chu said that when the ruling party uses 'democracy' to remove people from office, it actually uses this as a weapon to find enemies inside the country and remove opposing parties. He said people cannot help but remember famous times in history when groups gained power through democracy, but slowly became very strict and controlling. He keeps warning about extreme political movements because of lessons from history.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chu believes that hate is the most dangerous thing that can harm democracy. He said that when a society labels people who disagree and removes what they call 'noise,' if we do not notice quickly, we will lose more than just a few people's voices; we will lose the freedom of the whole society.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chu emphasized that the main idea of democracy is to 'live with people who disagree,' not to 'get rid of people who disagree.' The warning is to stop strict control from coming back and to protect Taiwan's democracy, which was hard to get. But he said it is sad that the ruling party's supporters are really thinking about using the word 'Nazi' as a political weapon. They want to use it to punish people who disagree and stop them from speaking freely. He repeated that these people do not want to warn others. They want to fight and stir up trouble. They are not thinking carefully about what they are doing. He said this way of acting is a very bad copy of democracy and a deep disrespect to people who suffered in the past.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chu stated that the Republic of China must be a country where everyone, no matter their background, beliefs, religion, or political ideas, can be treated equally and talk to each other in a smart way. He added that everyone should reject extreme ideas and hate together. We must protect a truly free Taiwan for the next generation.</p>

            <h1>Man Lies About Having a Master's Degree from Tsing Hua University, Sentenced to 1 Year and 2 Months for Fraud</h1>
            <p>A man named Lu applied for a job as a program technician at a company. He lied and said he had a master's degree from Tsing Hua University. He also said that TSMC had asked him to create software to make their machines work better. Because of these lies, he got the job and cheated the company out of over 2.35 million New Taiwan Dollars. The Hsinchu District Court has sentenced Mr. Lu to 1 year and 2 months in prison for fraud. He can appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>Court papers from the Hsinchu District Court show that around 2019, Mr. Lu applied for a job as a program technician at a company in Hsinchu City and was hired. Mr. Lu had not finished his studies at Chung Hua University, a private school. But he lied and said he had graduated with a master's degree in Information Management from National Tsing Hua University.</p>
            <p>The court papers state that Mr. Lu even told Mr. Peng, the company owner, that he used to run a semiconductor company. He said he had skills and connections in the semiconductor industry and knew important people at TSMC. He also claimed that TSMC had asked him to develop software to make their machines work better.</p>
            <p>The court papers also say that Mr. Peng believed that Mr. Lu had this experience. So, he signed a contract with Mr. Lu, hiring him as a special technical advisor. Mr. Peng paid him a 600,000 New Taiwan Dollar signing bonus. Mr. Lu also tricked Mr. Peng into investing over 2.35 million New Taiwan Dollars for related work. Later, Mr. Lu kept delaying the work. Only then did Mr. Peng realize he had been tricked.</p>
            <p>The judge thought that Mr. Lu did not earn money honestly. He used the victim's trust and lied about being asked to develop semiconductor software. He then took money. He did not care about the law and did not respect other people's property. His actions should be criticized.</p>
            <p>The judge said that Mr. Lu kept making excuses during the trial and did not show he was sorry. So, Mr. Lu was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison for fraud. The money he got from the crime, 2,958,495 New Taiwan Dollars, will be taken by the government. He can appeal.</p>

            <h1>Taichung International Stepping Dance Festival Starts in September, Moves to Coastal Area for the First Time</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Taichung International Stepping Dance Festival will be held from September 27th to 28th. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that this year it will be different. For the first time, it will take place in Qingshui District, near the coast, instead of in the city center. The festival will also work with the international brand Smurfs for promotion and has invited Nantou County Magistrate Hsu Shu-hua to be its spokesperson.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said at the press conference that 19 dance groups from 7 countries will perform together. This is the largest number of groups ever for the festival. Because this is the 10th year of the event, there are big plans to promote it with the Belgian cartoon characters, the Smurfs. From now on, you can see Smurfs in different areas of Taichung.</p>
            <p>She said that Ms. Hsu Shu-hua, who owns over 3,000 Smurfs, was asked to be the spokesperson. The city also borrowed hundreds of her Smurf items for a special exhibition. To protect the items, the Taichung City Government bought insurance for them. People who like Smurfs can go and see the exhibition.</p>
            <p>Also, Mayor Lu said that people can sign up online or in person for the 'Public Stepping Dance Fun Competition.' People can perform freely and legally on the streets. There is a total prize money of 100,000 New Taiwan Dollars. More than 30 groups have already signed up to join.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsu Shu-hua said it is not easy for an event to happen for 10 years in a row. She came to Taichung to learn more and hopes to learn a lot. This year, Taichung, Changhua County, Nantou County, and Miaoli County also promoted the festival in Hong Kong and Japan. Also, the National Day evening party will be in Taichung this year, and the National Day fireworks will be in Nantou. Taichung and Nantou will work together to promote these events.</p>
            <p>She said that because she loves Smurfs, when Mayor Lu invited the Belgian Ambassador to Taiwan to join the event, she received three Smurf figures colored like the Belgian flag from the ambassador. She was very touched.</p>
