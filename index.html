            <h1>Real Estate Agent in Taichung Accused of 1 Billion NTD Fraud, Arrested After Returning to Taiwan</h1>
            <p>A man named Ye, who owns a real estate business in Taichung's Xitun District, is involved in fraud and illegal fundraising. Over five years, he scammed people out of NT$1 billion. Ye fled Taiwan on the 20th but was caught when he returned today. Prosecutors have asked to keep him in custody.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office stated today that 42-year-old Ye, the owner of a real estate agency, was involved in fraud and illegal fundraising from September 2020 to September this year. The total amount scammed was over NT$1 billion. Ye ran away from Taiwan on the 20th.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors created a special team. They questioned victims and witnesses. They also collected proof like receipts, bank transfer records, and chat screenshots. On the 26th, Ye's passport was canceled, and a warrant for his arrest was issued. On the morning of the 28th, Ye came back to Taiwan from Thailand. Police arrested him at Taoyuan International Airport and brought him to justice.</p>
            <p>After questioning, the prosecutor believes Ye committed serious crimes such as fraud and illegal banking. These crimes carry a minimum sentence of 5 years in prison. He also tried to escape and might destroy evidence or talk to others involved or witnesses. So, the prosecutor asked the Taichung District Court tonight to keep him in custody and not allow him to see anyone.</p>

            <h1>China and North Korea's Foreign Ministers Meet in Beijing, Both Against Dominance and Acting Alone</h1>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported that China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met in Beijing today. Wang Yi said that China wants to work more closely with North Korea on world and local issues. They both oppose all forms of countries trying to control others and want to protect their shared interests. Choe Son Hui said that North Korea wants to work closely with China in many ways to stop countries from acting alone and using their power against others.</p>
            <p>The report said that during their meeting, they talked deeply about issues that both China and North Korea care about.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi said that the old friendship between the two countries is very valuable to both sides. "Keeping, making stronger, and developing" the relationship between China and North Korea has always been a "firm plan" for China's Communist Party and government. In early September, General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Communist Party of China and General Secretary Kim Jong Un of the Workers' Party of Korea had an important meeting. They agreed on things that "showed the way and planned the future" for the two countries' relationship.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi also said that China and North Korea are both socialist countries led by the Communist Party. They have "the same ideas and goals." They can share ideas about how to run their countries to help their socialist goals grow.</p>
            <p>He also said that the world is currently facing many changes and problems. Strong countries acting like bullies cause a lot of harm. China is happy that North Korea strongly supports China's main interests and worries. North Korea also supports Xi Jinping's idea of "building a community with a shared future for mankind" and his "Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, Global Civilization Initiative, and Global Governance Initiative." China wants to work more closely with North Korea on world and local issues, oppose all forms of countries trying to control others, and protect their shared interests and "fairness in the world."</p>
            <p>The report said that Choe Son Hui said the meetings between the top leaders of the two parties and two countries, North Korea and China, have "guided their plans and given strong energy" to make their relationship, especially its "socialist core," deeper.</p>
            <p>Choe Son Hui also said that Kim Jong Un once stated that no matter how the world changes, the friendly feelings between the people of North Korea and China will not change. Making the relationship between the two countries deeper and stronger is North Korea's firm goal. North Korea wants to work with China to carry out the agreements made by the top leaders of the two parties and two countries. This includes "improving talking about plans, increasing friendly exchanges, and making practical cooperation deeper" to help the relationship grow to new and higher levels.</p>
            <p>She also said that North Korea strongly supports Xi Jinping's idea of "a community with a shared future for mankind" and many global plans, especially the newest "Global Governance Initiative." North Korea also wants to work closely with China in many ways to stop countries from acting alone and using their power. They want to help create "a more fair and just world order."</p>

            <h1>Radio Taiwan International Website Hacked, Issues Statement to Fight Illegal Actions</h1>
            <p>The official website of Radio Taiwan International (RTI) was recently attacked by unknown people. The banner on the homepage was changed with bad content. Because of this, RTI gave information to the police and prosecutors. They asked for an investigation to start. RTI also said they will work with the police to stop these illegal actions.</p>
            <p>On September 11, Radio Taiwan International found that its official website was hacked. The main picture on the homepage (banner) was changed with bad content. RTI immediately gave proof to the Taipei City Police Department and the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, with whom they have a security agreement. They asked for technical help and an investigation.</p>
            <p>To protect its good name and avoid misunderstandings, Radio Taiwan International quickly made a statement today. They said that their job is to support government policies. They tell the world about Taiwan's important values like freedom, democracy, human rights, and different cultures. RTI is a very important platform for Taiwan to speak to other countries. But it has become a target for people who want to cause trouble. In recent years, RTI has spent a lot of money and effort to prevent and find such attacks. They will not allow anyone to attack them freely.</p>
            <p>The police and prosecutors are using the information given by Radio Taiwan International. They have called relevant people for questioning and are continuing the investigation. They are working to stop illegal actions that harm national security and information security. This is to protect the country's important computer systems.</p>
            <p>Now, the case is being investigated. Radio Taiwan International is waiting for the results. They will tell the public when they have more information. They will continue to watch their information security strongly and work with the police and investigators. They want to prevent future problems and ask for severe punishment for those who harm the country's communication security.</p>
