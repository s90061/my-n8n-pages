A new group called the "Lottery Sustainable Development Association" opened today. Its leader, Liu Dai-yang, said the group will help train people, study rules, and talk with other countries. This is to make sure Taiwan's lottery keeps helping society.

Chen Po-cheng from the Ministry of Finance said that how lotteries are sold and how sellers are supported should get better with time. He hopes the new association will bring fresh ideas. The association also wants to work with international lottery groups.

Since 1999, the lottery has earned a lot of money, about NT$644.1 billion. This money helps with national pension, health care, and social programs in local areas. It also gives jobs to around 68,000 people who need help, like those with disabilities. The Ministry of Finance hopes this new association will help the lottery industry grow well for a long time.

**Baseball Games Often Postponed, Coach Says Facilities Need Improvement**

Many professional baseball games in Taiwan have been stopped or moved recently. This is because of bad weather and a typhoon. Some baseball stadiums in the south were damaged.

Hung I-chung, the coach of the Tsai Kang Hawks team, said that their home stadium is fine. But he thinks that Taiwan's baseball fields and other things need to be better in general. He said that games are often stopped because of heavy rain. He believes Taiwan needs indoor stadiums because it rains a lot, and when it doesn't rain, it's very hot.

He also mentioned that baseball places in Japan are much better. Coach Hung feels that good facilities are very important for baseball to grow in Taiwan.

**Premier Cho asks Parliament to Support NT$410 Billion Bill for Taiwan**

Taiwan's Premier, Cho Jung-tai, visited Changhua after heavy rains. He asked the lawmakers in parliament to support a special bill for NT$410 billion (about US$12.7 billion) and other money plans. He wants them to think about the country and its people.

A typhoon brought a lot of rain to Changhua, causing floods and damaging farms. Premier Cho said the government plans to spend a lot of money in the future to stop floods. They want to make drainage better and add more places for water to go.

Premier Cho also talked about power cuts. He thanked the workers from Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) who are fixing power lines, even in the rain. He asked parliament to give NT$100 billion to Taipower. He said this money is important for people's daily lives and for businesses. He asked all parties in parliament to support the NT$410 billion bill, which includes money for Taipower and other important things for Taiwan.
