            <h1>Gunman at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, Students and Public Told to Lock Doors and Find Safety</h1>
            <p>Police in the U.S. received a report today about a gunman on the campus of Villanova University in Pennsylvania. The university is about to start its new semester. This year, the university is very noticeable because it is where the new Catholic Pope Leo XIV studied.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, students shared a text message from the Villanova University alert system. The message told them to lock and block their doors and windows, and to go to a safe place. A second alert from the school staff told everyone to stay away from the law school.</p>
            <p>Officials in Radnor Township posted a message on social media platform X. They told nearby residents and students to find safety where they were. The post did not give more information.</p>
            <p>Videos shared on social media showed a group of people being quickly led into a building on campus. Orientation and registration for new students started today. They will continue until August 23rd, and the new semester begins on August 25th.</p>
            <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Lisa Borowski, whose area includes Villanova, said she got a text message around 5 p.m. from Radnor Township police and Villanova University police. The message asked local residents to find safety where they were.</p>
            <p>Borowski said, "I am very worried, and I am very concerned."</p>

            <h1>UN Asks US to Stop Action Against ICC Judges, Remove All Penalties</h1>
            <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) had previously issued an arrest warrant for the Prime Minister of Israel. It also started an investigation into U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan for possible war crimes. Yesterday, the U.S. government announced penalties against four judges. Today, the United Nations (UN) asked the U.S. to stop these actions.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that yesterday, the U.S. placed more penalties on two ICC judges and two prosecutors. These people were even from friendly countries like France and Canada. Many people see this action by the U.S. as a way to make the ICC's investigation into Israel weaker.</p>
            <p>Volker Turk, the UN's top official for human rights, said in a statement: "The U.S. must stop its ongoing actions against international organizations and their staff."</p>
            <p>Turk said that putting penalties on ICC staff who are doing their jobs "harms the rule of law and damages justice." He asked the U.S. to remove all the penalties.</p>
            <p>Turk also said, "At the same time, I ask all countries to immediately take steps to protect all the people affected by these penalties. This includes telling companies in their areas not to follow these penalties."</p>
            <p>"Countries need to stand up and protect the organizations they created to keep human rights and the rule of law safe. People who work to record, investigate, and charge serious violations of international law should not have to work in fear."</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Go Up More Than 1% Because Russia and Ukraine Talk Peace Slowly and US Needs a Lot of Oil</h1>
            <p>Oil prices went up by almost 1 dollar per barrel today. This happened because Russia and Ukraine are blaming each other for slowing down peace talks. Also, the U.S., which uses the most oil in the world, showed earlier that it needs a lot of oil.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures went up by 83 cents. This is a 1.2% increase, and it closed at $67.67 per barrel. This is the highest price in two weeks.</p>
            <p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures went up by 81 cents. This is a 1.3% increase, and it closed at $63.52 per barrel.</p>
