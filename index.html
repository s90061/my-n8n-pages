            <h1>Heavy Rain Warning for 7 Counties and Cities; Southern Taiwan Has Thunderstorms</h1>
            <p>Today, August 25th, the Central Weather Administration issued a heavy rain warning for 7 counties and cities, including Nantou County. Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County also received immediate warnings for severe thunderstorms. People in these areas should be careful about flooding.</p>
            <p>The weather administration said that strong rain showers are likely in the afternoon. There is a chance of heavy rain in areas south of Chiayi, and in the mountain areas of Nantou and Yunlin. People should be aware of lightning and strong winds. In mountain areas, there is a risk of landslides, falling rocks, and sudden increases in river water.</p>
            <p>The areas under the heavy rain warning include the mountain areas of Nantou County and Yunlin County, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, and the Hengchun Peninsula.</p>
            <p>The weather administration also issued immediate thunderstorm warnings for Pingtung County, Kaohsiung City, and Tainan City. They explained that strong thunderstorms often come with lightning, thunder, and heavy rain. Strong winds and even hail might also happen. If these storms happen upstream in rivers, the water downstream can rise quickly. Areas with poor drainage might flood. Heavy rain makes it dangerous for outdoor activities and reduces visibility, which affects driving safety. In mountain areas, landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides are common. The report was written by Yu Hsiao-wen (‰ΩôÊõâÈõØ) and edited by Guan Chung-wei (ÁÆ°‰∏≠Á∂≠).</p>

            <h1>Foreign Media Says 2-Nanometer Factory Removed Chinese Equipment; TSMC: Developing Different Solutions</h1>
            <p>Nikkei Asia reported that TSMC has decided to remove equipment made in mainland China from its most advanced 2-nanometer chip factories. TSMC said it does not comment on market rumors. The company stressed that its global purchasing plan uses a good risk management system and close partnerships with suppliers to keep developing different solutions. This helps build a diverse group of global suppliers.</p>
            <p>The report said that TSMC's decision is because of the US "CHIPS Act." Senator Mark Kelly proposed this law. It says that chip companies that get money or tax benefits from the US cannot buy equipment from "foreign entities of concern." Many Chinese suppliers are included in this group.</p>
            <p>TSMC said it does not comment on market rumors. The company repeated that its global purchasing strategy is to use a good system for managing risks and work closely with suppliers. This helps them keep creating many different options and build a wide range of global suppliers.</p>
            <p>TSMC's 2-nanometer chips will start being made in the second half of this year. Besides preparing several 2-nanometer factories in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung Science Parks, TSMC's third factory in Arizona, USA, will also use 2-nanometer and A16 processes. The report was written by Chang Chien-chung (ÂºµÂª∫‰∏≠) and edited by Chang Liang-chih (ÂºµËâØÁü•).</p>

            <h1>Minister Chiu Tai-yuan: Premier Cho Jung-tai Did Not Ask Me to Write a Resignation Letter; We Met to Discuss Work Plans</h1>
            <p>Media reported that Chiu Tai-yuan, the Minister of Health and Welfare, refused to resign after meeting with Premier Cho Jung-tai a few days ago. Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai said he met with Chiu Tai-yuan, but they talked about work plans. Minister Chiu Tai-yuan also said that Premier Cho Jung-tai did not ask him to write a resignation letter; they only discussed work plans and how the "Healthy Taiwan" program is going.</p>
            <p>Media reports suggested that Chiu Tai-yuan, who has often been mentioned as someone who might be replaced, was trying to keep his job. They said that even though Premier Cho Jung-tai hinted he should write a resignation letter, Chiu Tai-yuan refused and said he believed he was still fit for the job.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan invited Premier Cho Jung-tai and other government leaders to give a special report. The report was about "the progress, direction, principles of the Taiwan-US tariff negotiations, and the possible effects on Taiwanese industries." They also answered questions.</p>
            <p>When Legislator Lai Shyh-bao from the Kuomintang asked questions, he mentioned the media reports that Premier Cho Jung-tai asked Chiu Tai-yuan to write a resignation letter, and Chiu Tai-yuan refused. He then asked if Chiu Tai-yuan had met with Premier Cho Jung-tai a few days ago.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai confirmed they met. He said that when he met Chiu Tai-yuan, the first thing he asked was if Chiu had long-term plans for his future work. Chiu Tai-yuan explained many things about his past and future work. Only the two of them were there; no media was present.</p>
            <p>Chiu Tai-yuan stated that he was not asked to write a resignation letter. He said they only talked about work plans and the progress of the "Healthy Taiwan" initiative. The report was written by Wang Yang-yu (ÁéãÊèöÂÆá) and edited by Su Lung-chi (ËòáÈæçÈ∫í).</p>
