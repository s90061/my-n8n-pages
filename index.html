            <h1>United States to Impose 15% Tariff on All EU Goods; Car Tariffs Lowered, But Alcohol Not Exempt</h1>
            <p>Brussels, August 21 â€“ The United States and the European Union today shared the details of a new trade agreement. Under this agreement, the tax on cars sent to the U.S. will go down. However, the 15% tax on wine, which Europe hoped to remove, will stay. The EU says it will try to get the U.S. to make more changes later.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, U.S. President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed on a basic plan in July. This plan says that most products from the EU sent to the U.S. will have a 15% tax.</p>
            <p>But the EU tried to get some industries to be free from these taxes. At the same time, Trump threatened to raise taxes on other industries. So, many things were still unclear.</p>
            <p>Today, a joint statement from both sides made the agreement clearer. Even though the talks are not finished, some things are still not certain.</p>
            <p>The EU stated that the "maximum, all-inclusive" 15% tax will apply to most European products sent to the U.S. This includes cars, medicines, computer chips, and wood.</p>
            <p>Maros Sefcovic, the EU official in charge of trade, told reporters in Brussels, "This is the best trade agreement the U.S. has made with any partner." He added that this new tax will not be added to any existing taxes.</p>
            <p>Sefcovic also said he is confident that the tax rate on cars will be lower than the current 27.5%. This change will start on August 1st. He said that the U.S. has promised this.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, France, Italy, and other countries that produce wine tried to get a zero tax on wine. But wine and spirits will still have the 15% tax when sent to the U.S.</p>
            <p>The "French Federation of Wine and Spirit Exporters" (FEVS) said they were "very disappointed." Gabriel Picard, who represents the group, said, "We are sure this will cause big problems for the wine and spirits business."</p>
            <p>Christophe Chateau, a spokesperson for the Bordeaux Wine Council, said this was "bad news." But he also said it was better than the worst possible situation, because Trump had once threatened a tax as high as 200%.</p>
            <p>Chateau said, "This makes it harder for Bordeaux wine to be traded and sent to the U.S." The U.S. is currently the biggest market for Bordeaux wine.</p>
            <p>The office of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that this agreement "is not yet perfect or final." But it has stopped a "trade war."</p>
            <p>Under the agreement, the EU promised to greatly reduce limits on seafood and farm products from the U.S. This includes nuts, dairy products, fruits, vegetables, pork, and bison meat.</p>

            <h1>Details of US-EU Trade Deal Revealed; Most European Stocks Close Higher</h1>
            <p>London, August 21 â€“ Today, the United States and the European Union shared the details of their trade agreement. In the future, most goods from the EU sent to the U.S. will have a 15% tax. This news has ended the uncertainty about how much extra tax the U.S. would add. Because of this, most major stock markets in Europe closed higher today.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 21.06 points, or 0.23%. It closed at 9309.20 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up a little, by 16.37 points, or 0.07%. It closed at 24293.34 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 34.74 points, or 0.44%. It closed at 7938.29 points.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine's Security; Reuters: Options Include European Troops Led by U.S.</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 21 â€“ Today, the U.S. military announced that military leaders from the United States and some European countries have finished looking into military choices for Ukraine. These choices will now be given to each country's national security advisors to consider. People close to the matter told Reuters that one choice is to send European troops to Ukraine, but with the U.S. in charge of leading and managing them.</p>
            <p>U.S. President Trump has promised to help protect Ukraine based on any agreement that ends Russia's war there. Reuters had previously reported that military planners from the U.S. and Europe had already started looking into how to keep Ukraine safe after the conflict.</p>
            <p>The U.S. military stated, "These choices will be given to each country's national security advisors. They will think about them as part of the ongoing diplomatic work."</p>
            <p>A meeting of defense leaders from the U.S., Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Ukraine happened in Washington from August 19th to 21st.</p>
            <p>Reuters was the first to report that the plan to be given to the national security advisors is now ready.</p>
            <p>On August 18th, Trump promised to give Kyiv security. Ukraine and its European friends were happy about this, but many questions still do not have answers.</p>
            <p>Officials said that U.S. and European planners need time to find out which plans are possible for the military and which ones the Kremlin would accept.</p>
            <p>Sources told Reuters that one idea is to send European troops to Ukraine, but the U.S. would be in control of how they operate.</p>
            <p>To help reach a peace agreement, Western countries have asked NATO members to send troops. However, Russia's foreign ministry has said no to this idea.</p>
            <p>Trump had publicly said he would not send U.S. troops to Ukraine. But on August 19th, he seemed to open the door for the U.S. to be involved militarily in other ways.</p>
            <p>The U.S. might give air support in different ways. This includes giving Ukraine more systems to defend against air attacks and creating an area where no flights are allowed, controlled by U.S. fighter jets.</p>
