Taiwan's men's basketball team lost their first game at the Jones Cup to the Philippines, with a score of 56 to 67. The game's turning point was the third quarter, where the Taiwanese team could not score any points from field goals, missing all 16 attempts. They only got 2 points from free throws in that quarter.

In contrast, the Philippines played very strongly in the second half, especially in the third quarter, making a 21-0 run. This sudden surge made the crowd quiet and gave the Philippines a big lead, 54-37, by the end of the third quarter. Even though Taiwan tried to catch up in the last quarter, it was too late. Chen Ying-chun scored the most points for Taiwan with 14.

**Taiwan Fisheries Agency Responds to CNN Report on Abused Migrant Workers**

CNN reported that migrant workers in Taiwan's distant water fisheries have experienced abuse, injuries, and even death. In response, Taiwan's Fisheries Agency stated that they have "zero tolerance" for any form of labor exploitation. They also mentioned that Taiwan started an "Fisheries and Human Rights Action Plan" in 2022.

The agency expressed sadness about the individual cases mentioned in the report and said they are investigating them. This includes a worker whose finger was injured but did not get insurance money, and another worker who died on a ship from Vanuatu. The Fisheries Agency confirmed they helped resolve a situation where some workers were not paid their wages. They want to make it clear that these are rare cases and that most of Taiwan's fishing boats follow the law and treat foreign workers well. Taiwan also welcomes international groups to visit and see their efforts to improve human rights in the fishing industry.

**Woman Dies After Bus Crash in Zhonghe**

A serious traffic accident happened in Zhonghe, New Taipei City, where a bus crashed into several cars and motorcycles. The bus driver was waiting at a red light and, for an unknown reason, hit the vehicles in front when the light turned green. Some motorcycle riders managed to get away quickly, but two cars and two motorcycles were hit.

A 54-year-old woman, who was a passenger on a motorcycle, fell down and was run over by the bus. She had no breath or heartbeat at the scene and later died in the hospital after emergency treatment. The 60-year-old bus driver passed an alcohol test, meaning he had not been drinking. The bus company has apologized to the victim's family, promised to take responsibility for the accident, and will help with arrangements. They will also work with the police to find out exactly what caused the crash.
