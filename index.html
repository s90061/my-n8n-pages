German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said on July 13th that the European Union (EU) should take "decisive countermeasures" if it cannot reach a fair trade agreement with the United States. This is to avoid new tariffs.

Klingbeil told a German newspaper that the EU and the US need to have serious talks to solve trade issues. If these talks fail, the EU will need to act strongly to protect jobs and businesses in Europe.

This comes after former US President Donald Trump announced that new tariffs of up to 30% would be placed on goods from the EU and Mexico starting August 1st. Trump said these tariffs were because of an unfair trade balance with the EU. Klingbeil believes these tariffs will harm both sides and stated that Europe wants a fair agreement.

**Keelung Bus Stop Electronic Sign Text Questioned as Political Propaganda; Village Chief Says It's Removed**

On July 13th, people in Keelung saw an electronic sign at a bus stop displaying messages like "Disagree with the Legislative Yuan's one-party dictatorship." A group pushing for a recall questioned if this was political advertising. The village chief said he has removed the text to prevent misunderstandings.

The electronic sign is at the "Xinchonghou Station" bus stop on Dongguang Road in Keelung City. It is managed by the Dongming Village Office. The moving text included phrases such as "Disagree with the Legislative Yuan's one-party dictatorship," "Disagree with representatives ignoring national and public interests," and "Agree to develop people's economy."

Chen Ching-yi, who is leading the recall effort against Kuomintang Legislator Lin Pei-xiang, asked who wrote the messages and why a public bus stop was used for political promotion. She asked the Keelung City Government to explain and remove the content.

The city government stated that the village office manages the sign and that they respect the village chief's right to speak. However, because the content was not related to city matters, they agreed with the village chief, Weng Cheng-chung, to remove the words for now. Weng said he removed the text to avoid further misunderstanding and changed it to messages about air raid drills.
