            <h1>Li Qiang Meets US Lawmakers: China and US Should Work Together and Talk to Solve Issues</h1>
            <p>On September 21, Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with US Congressman Adam Smith and his group in Beijing. This was the first visit by a US House of Representatives delegation in six years. Li Qiang said that China and the US should be partners, working together for progress. He added that China is ready to talk with the US to solve each other's worries.</p>
            <p>China's Foreign Ministry shared that Li Qiang said both China and the US are big, important countries in the world. He believes that a stable, healthy, and lasting relationship between them is good for both nations and what the world hopes for.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Trump have spoken many times this year. They both agreed to have more talks and work together. This will help guide how the relationship develops next. China wants to respect each other, live peacefully, and win together with the US. He hopes the US will work with China to move the relationship forward in the right way, which will help both countries and the world.</p>
            <p>Li Qiang said China and the US should be partners who help each other succeed. He added that China is willing to solve their concerns through talks, treating each other equally, with respect, and for mutual benefit. He hopes the US Congress will see China and its relationship with the US clearly. He wants them to actively help with talks and working together, playing a positive role for friendship and shared development.</p>
            <p>The US delegation was led by Democratic Congressman Adam Smith.</p>
            <p>Hong Kong's TVB News reported that Smith told Li Qiang that China and the US are the two strongest and most important countries in the world. He said it is very important for them to find a way to live together peacefully.</p>
            <p>He also stated, "Trade and the economy are the most important topics. But we also mainly represent the House Armed Services Committee, so we are very interested in talks between the two militaries."</p>
            <p>Li Qiang said that this "ice-breaking" visit by the US will help the relationship grow more.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this is the first time a US House delegation has visited China since 2019. The two countries are talking more to try and make their relationship stable.</p>

            <h1>US: UK, Canada, Australia Recognizing Palestine Is "Just for Show"</h1>
            <p>Today, the United States said that some of its important friends, like the UK, Australia, and Canada, are recognizing Palestine as a country. The US called this "just for show."</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the US State Department, who did not want to be named, told AFP that the US is focused on serious discussions, not on actions that are just for show. The spokesperson said their main goals are clear: to free the people who are held hostage, to keep Israel safe, and to bring peace and good living conditions to the whole area once Hamas is no longer there.</p>
            <p>After the UK, Canada, and Australia, Portugal also announced today that it recognizes Palestine as a country. More countries, like France, are expected to do the same after the big meeting at the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
            <p>However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that he has stopped the creation of a "terrorist country" for many years. He did this even with a lot of pressure from inside and outside his country. He also said, "We did this with strong will and smart decisions. Also, we have made the Jewish towns in the Judea and Samaria Area twice as big, and we will continue to do so."</p>
            <p>The Judea and Samaria Area is the official name Israel uses for the West Bank, which it controls.</p>
            <p>At the same time, a high-ranking official from Hamas, a Palestinian group, said today that the recognition of Palestine by the UK, Canada, and Australia is a big win for the Palestinian people's rights.</p>
            <p>The Hamas official, Mahmud Mardawi, told AFP, "These steps mean that the Palestinian cause has won, and our goal has finally received justice. It also sends a clear message: no matter how many bad things the occupiers do, they can never take away our national rights."</p>

            <h1>People's Views on Inflation: Cathay Financial Says 68% Expect Over 2% in a Year</h1>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holdings released its September survey about how confident people are in the economy. The survey asked people what they expect for prices and the inflation rate in the next year. The results showed that 68% of people think the inflation rate will be more than 2% in one year. 32% of people think it will be less than 2%.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial said today that the survey shows people are more positive about the economy. The index that measures how positive people feel about the current economy went up to -34.4. The index for how positive they feel about the future also went up to -32.0. People are more willing to spend a lot of money, with that index going up to -0.9. However, they are a little less willing to buy big, long-lasting items, with that index going down to -19.7. The desire to buy a house went up slightly to -48.7, but the desire to sell a house went down to -36.3.</p>
            <p>For the stock market, Cathay Financial explained that global trade rules are clearer now, and central banks are expected to make money policies easier. This has caused international stock markets to rise. The survey results show that people are more positive about Taiwan's stock market, with that index going up to 6.2. The index for how willing people are to take risks also went up to 8.3.</p>
            <p>In the part about current issues, the survey asked people about their thoughts on the inflation rate one year from now. The results showed that 68% of people expect the inflation rate to be more than 2% in one year. Among these, 37% think it will be between 2% and 3%, and 31% think it will be more than 3%. On the other hand, 32% of people think the inflation rate will be less than 2% in one year.</p>
            <p>The survey also asked about the main things people think will cause prices to go up or down in the next year. 32% of people believe that the prices of everyday goods will be the main reason. 27% think the economic situation will cause prices to change. Another 13% believe that the prices of imported raw materials are the main factor that will decide if prices go up or down in the next year.</p>
            <p>For the overall economy, the average expectation for Taiwan's economic growth rate in 2025 went up to 3.19%. 60% of people think the economic growth rate in 2025 will be higher than 3%. The average expected inflation rate for 2025 stayed the same at 2.25%. 59% of people think the inflation rate in 2025 will be higher than 2%.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial pointed out that the government's statistics office (DGBAS) predicted on August 15, 2025, that Taiwan's economic growth rate in 2025 would be 4.45% and the inflation rate 1.76%. Compared to the DGBAS, people are still less hopeful about economic growth in 2025 but expect prices to go up more.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial stated that the survey was conducted from September 1 to 7. Emails were sent to members of Cathay Life's official website and customers of Cathay United Bank. A total of 12,914 people completed the survey.</p>
            <p>In recent years, inflation has been a big topic. People often call an inflation rate (CPI) of 2% a warning sign. The Central Bank believes that because Taiwan is a small country with an open economy, it is better to have a flexible way of defining stable prices, rather than setting a clear inflation goal to follow.</p>
