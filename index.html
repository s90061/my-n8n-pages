            <h1>Young People Addicted to Social Media: South Korea Bans Phones in Classrooms Nationwide</h1>
            <p>On August 27, the South Korean parliament passed a new law. This law stops all students in the country from using mobile phones or other digital devices during school classes. This shows that more and more people are worried about how much young people use social media.</p>
            <p>According to reports from Reuters and BBC, both ruling and opposition parties in South Korea supported this law. The aim is to control the problem of smartphone addiction. Many studies now show that this problem has bad effects. The new law will start when the new school year begins in March next year.</p>
            <p>Members of parliament, parents, and teachers in South Korea say that students using phones in class affects their schoolwork. They believe that time that could be used for learning is being taken up by phones.</p>
            <p>A survey by the South Korean Ministry of Education last year found that about 37% of middle and high school students said social media affected their daily lives. Also, 22% of middle and high school students felt worried when they could not log in to their social media accounts.</p>
            <p>One of the people who suggested the law, Cho Jung-hoon, a member of the opposition People Power Party, said in parliament: "Young people in our country are now very addicted to social media. Our children's eyes are red every morning because they are scrolling through Instagram until 2 or 3 AM."</p>
            <p>South Korea is now the newest country to limit how children and teenagers use phones and social media. Some countries like Finland and France already have similar bans, but only for younger students. Other countries like Italy, the Netherlands, and China also have bans for all school levels.</p>
            <p>Australia, which was one of the first countries to ban social media for teenagers, recently made its ban even bigger. A study in the Netherlands in July found that students' ability to focus improved after phone bans were put in place in their schools.</p>

            <h1>Trump Asks for Financial Investor Soros to be Charged, Says He Started Violent Protests in the US</h1>
            <p>On August 27, US President Trump said that billionaire George Soros and his son should face criminal charges. He claimed that Soros's family was behind "violent protests" across the United States. Trump gave no facts to support his claims, which are often made by right-wing groups against the Soros family.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Donald Trump wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social": "Soros and his very far-left son should be charged under the RICO Act for supporting violent protests and much more." RICO stands for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</p>
            <p>In June, street protests happened in Los Angeles, California, because more immigrants were being caught. During this time, old conspiracy theories about the Soros family became popular again.</p>
            <p>Soros, who was born in Hungary and is now 95 years old, has long been disliked by far-right groups in Europe and the US. This is because he gives money to progressive ideas and the Democratic Party in America. Many times, attacks on Soros, who is Jewish, have been called anti-Semitic (against Jewish people).</p>
            <p>Soros has been wrongly blamed for making the immigration crisis in Europe and at the southern US border worse. He has also been accused of planning big protests, including the anti-police protests in 2020 after an African American man, George Floyd, died when a police officer kneeled on his neck.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote in his post: "Soros and his group of sick friends have caused a lot of harm to our country! This also includes his crazy friends on the West Coast of America."</p>
            <p>Trump also said: "We will not let these crazy people keep tearing America apart. Be careful, we are watching you!"</p>
            <p>The "Open Society Foundations," a charity started by Soros, strongly criticized Trump's words. In a statement given to Agence France-Presse, they wrote: "The Open Society Foundations does not support or give money to violent protests." Soros announced in 2023 that he would give control of the organization to his son, Alexander Soros.</p>
