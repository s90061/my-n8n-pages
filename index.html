            <h1>White House: Trump will attend US Open Men's Final</h1>
            <p>White House officials said that US President Trump will go to the US Open men's tennis final in New York on September 7th. This is the latest big sports event he will attend.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that officials, who did not want to be named, confirmed today that Trump will be at the US Open final. Trump also went to the NFL Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.</p>
            <p>The players for the US Open men's singles final will be decided tonight. Novak Djokovic from Serbia will play against Carlos Alcaraz from Spain in the semi-finals. Jannik Sinner from Italy will play against Felix Auger-Aliassime from Canada.</p>
            <p>This will be the first time Trump has been at Flushing Meadows since 2015. At that time, Trump was a candidate for president, and people booed his wife, Melania Trump, when she arrived.</p>
            <p>Bill Clinton, a Democrat, was the last president to go to the US Open. He was also the first president ever to watch the US Open. Clinton watched the women's singles final in 2000.</p>
            <p>Trump also said he plans to go to the first day of the Ryder Cup golf tournament later this month.</p>

            <h1>Alcaraz beats Djokovic in straight sets, advances to US Open final</h1>
            <p>Carlos Alcaraz, a good player from Spain, won against Novak Djokovic from Serbia today. He won in three straight sets. This means he has reached the US Open final for the second time in his career.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Alcaraz beat Djokovic with scores of 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), and 6-2. This stopped Djokovic, who has won 24 Grand Slam titles, from winning another one.</p>
            <p>Alcaraz is trying to win his sixth Grand Slam title. This would be his second US Open title, after winning in 2022.</p>
            <p>In the final on September 7th, he will play against the current champion, Jannik Sinner. Or, he will play against Felix Auger-Aliassime from Canada, who is the 25th seed in the tournament.</p>
