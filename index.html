            <h1>Lifestyle Changes Help Lower Diabetes Risk: Doctor Says It's Better Than Medicine</h1>
            <p>A study in Taiwan shows that more young people under 40 are getting diabetes. Doctors say that your waist size is a key sign for metabolic syndrome. Research found that changing your lifestyle, like what you eat and how much you exercise, can greatly lower your risk of getting diabetes. This works even better than medicine.</p>
            <p>Today, Ou Hong-yi, who leads the Diabetes Health Education Society of the Republic of China, said in a health education meeting that a study in Taiwan found the number of young people under 40 with diabetes went up. In 2016, it was 0.853%, and in 2022, it was 1.041%. One important reason for this is metabolic syndrome.</p>
            <p>Yang Wei-hsun, who leads the Diabetes Society of the Republic of China, pointed out that metabolic syndrome was once thought to be a stage before illness. But in fact, at this stage, the risk of heart and blood vessel diseases starts to rise. It is also linked to a higher risk of certain cancers, like cancers of the female reproductive system and colon cancer in men. It is defined by things like a large belly, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar when you haven't eaten. The most important part of this is waist size, which is closely linked to fat around your organs.</p>
            <p>Cai Meng-hsiu, who is in charge of health management and preventive medicine at Chi Mei Hospital, said that adult men's waists should be smaller than 90 centimeters, and women's should be smaller than 80 centimeters. To measure, you should stand naturally in the morning before eating. Take off clothes around your waist. Use a measuring tape around the middle of your stomach, between the top of your hip bones and the bottom of your ribs. The tape should touch your skin but not press it.</p>
            <p>To fight pre-diabetes, Cai Meng-hsiu explained that studies show if people take part in a lifestyle improvement plan, eat healthy, and do at least 150 minutes of medium-level exercise each week, after 2.8 years, their chance of getting diabetes drops by 58%. For those who only take medicine, the risk only drops by 31%. Another study, which lasted 15 years, also found that changing lifestyle worked better than medicine.</p>
            <p>Cai Meng-hsiu also said that in daily life, eating healthy, moving more, getting enough sleep, managing stress, staying away from smoking and drinking, and having good social connections can help reduce your waist size and get healthy again. For food, be careful about hidden salt and flavors in food you buy outside. Do not drink fruit juice instead of eating real fruits and vegetables. For exercise, you should get a little out of breath, feel a bit warm, and sweat. Slowly increase your exercise time until you reach at least 150 minutes.</p>
            <p>Wei Hsi-lun, the Deputy Director of the Health Promotion Administration, said that since 2022, the Health Promotion Administration has been running a "Metabolic Syndrome Prevention Program." This program gives health advice, like balanced eating and regular exercise, to people with metabolic syndrome. This helps people manage their health early. After 3 years of this program, a study of the people who joined showed that more than 50% of those whose waist size was not normal and who finished at least 3 follow-up checks saw their waist size improve. About 12% of them reached a normal waist size.</p>

            <h1>To Give Out Cash to Everyone or Not? Green Camp Says There Are Three Big Problems to Solve</h1>
            <p>Today, Wu Szu-yao, who is a main leader for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the Parliament (Legislative Yuan), said that giving cash to everyone is still being discussed. The big problems are: first, if the government needs to borrow money to do it; second, how to make sure it follows the constitution, because there were worries it might not; and third, if rich people should be excluded. She said that in the past, when the Parliament talked about special rules, they never discussed these points. But now, the ruling party is facing these issues seriously and responsibly. She asked other political parties to also take these problems seriously.</p>
            <p>The government's main office, the Executive Yuan, had planned to approve a special law today. This law was meant to make Taiwan's economy, society, and national safety stronger because of global events. It also included a budget of 235 billion New Taiwan Dollars for giving cash to everyone. However, for some reason, it was not put on the meeting's agenda today.</p>
            <p>In the morning, Wu Szu-yao answered questions from reporters at the Parliament. She said that giving cash to everyone is still being discussed. The problem is that the government might need to borrow money to do it. Can the country afford this? On one hand, there will be other big costs in the future, like special rules for typhoon disasters, money for water control, and national defense. On the other hand, after changes to the law about how money is shared between central and local governments, 375.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars will be given to local governments in the new year. After all, the total money available is limited.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said the second problem is this: if they decide to give out cash, they must make sure it follows the constitution. When the Parliament changed the law on their own before, there were worries it was not constitutional. To make it constitutional, the government and the Parliament need to talk more about the steps.</p>
            <p>Regarding the rule about excluding rich people, which others are concerned about, Wu Szu-yao said whether to exclude rich people or not is an important topic to discuss.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao explained that if the cash handout is seen as a social welfare program, then rich people should be excluded. However, if they follow what other parties say â€“ to use extra money from the government's budget and taxes to give cash to everyone â€“ then excluding those who paid the most taxes would go against the idea of 'returning tax money to the people,' which other parties support.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao stated that all these problems can and should be discussed. She hopes that members of other political parties will also face them seriously. She added that in the past, when special laws were discussed, other parties never talked about whether to exclude rich people, where the money would come from, or how much the country could afford to give out. Now, the ruling party, which is responsible, must deal with these issues seriously.</p>
