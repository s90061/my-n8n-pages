            <h1>US Government Buys Shares in North American Lithium Company to Reduce Dependence on China</h1>
            <p>Today, Lithium Americas, a large North American company that mines lithium, announced that the US Department of Energy (DOE) has bought 5% of its shares. The US Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, said this action is important to balance China's strong position in the lithium market.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, Lithium Americas is based in Vancouver, Canada. The company is developing one of the world's biggest lithium mines in northern Nevada, USA.</p>
            <p>Reports say that the US Department of Energy now owns 5% of Lithium Americas. It also owns 5% of the company's Thacker Pass lithium mining project in Nevada.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News and the Associated Press state that the Thacker Pass project has the largest amount of lithium in the US. It is a joint project between Lithium Americas and General Motors.</p>
            <p>The Thacker Pass lithium project is seen as very important. It will help the US rely less on China for lithium. Lithium is a key material used to make high-tech batteries for cell phones, electric cars, and renewable energy.</p>
            <p>US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement that this agreement with Lithium Americas makes the country's supply chain stronger. It also helps the US rely less on other countries that are not friendly for important minerals.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Wright told Bloomberg TV that this is a necessary step to challenge China's control of the lithium market.</p>

            <h1>Supreme Court Stops Trump from Firing Cook; She Stays as Fed Governor for Now</h1>
            <p>Today, the US Supreme Court decided not to rule right away on President Trump's request to fire Lisa Cook from her job at the Federal Reserve (Fed). This means she can stay in her position for now. The case will likely be heard early next year.</p>
            <p>In its order, the court said it has "delayed" deciding on the request. They will wait for "oral arguments in January 2026." This means Cook will remain in her job until the case is decided.</p>
            <p>President Biden, a Democrat, appointed Cook. She has said she will not resign and will not be "forced out" by Trump.</p>
            <p>Trump ordered Cook to be fired. His reason was that in 2021, when she applied for a home loan, she listed two properties in Michigan and Georgia as her "main home." This suggested she might have given false information to get better loan conditions.</p>
            <p>Cook has said she did nothing wrong. She has not been charged with any crime.</p>
            <p>Federal District Court Judge Jia Cobb decided that the government did not follow a legal rule. This rule says that a Fed governor can only be removed for a "just cause." Judge Cobb said this reason must be about bad behavior while in office. Cook became a Fed governor in 2022.</p>
            <p>Judge Cobb also believes that Trump's attempt to fire Cook would take away her legal right to challenge her dismissal.</p>

            <h1>European Stock Markets Close Higher, Led by Drug Company Shares</h1>
            <p>Today, important stock markets in Europe closed higher. This happened even though the US government shut down because politicians could not agree on a spending plan. The rise in European stocks was helped by drug company shares. This was after the drug company Pfizer agreed to lower its prices in the US. Because of this, Trump removed some taxes on Pfizer's goods.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 96.00 points, or 1.03%. It closed at 9446.43 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up by 232.90 points, or 0.98%. It closed at 24113.62 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went up by 71.01 points, or 0.90%. It closed at 7966.95 points.</p>
