            <h1>Philippine President Marcos Jr.'s Trust with People Goes Up a Lot</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Lin Hang-jian, Manila, 15th July) A new survey from the Philippines in June shows that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s trust from the people went up by 10 percent from May. His net trust score changed from negative in May to positive in June, which is a good sign. However, Vice President Sara Duterte is still trusted by more people among high-ranking government officials.</p>
            <p>According to a survey released today by the Philippine survey group "Social Weather Stations" (SWS) for June, 48% of people "trust" Marcos Jr. "a lot," 21% "cannot decide," and 30% "trust him a little." So, his net trust score is +18.</p>
            <p>In the May survey, only 38% "trusted" Marcos Jr. "a lot," 21% "could not decide," and 39% "trusted him a little." His net trust score was -1.</p>
            <p>The survey shows that Marcos Jr.'s trust from the people has been going down since July of last year. April of this year was his lowest point, with 36% trusting him "a lot" and 40% trusting him "a little." His net trust score was -4. It is important to note that in the June survey, the number of people who said they "trust him a lot" went up by a large 10 percent from May. His net trust score improved for two months in a row and became positive in June, showing a good change.</p>
            <p>This survey was done from June 25th to 29th. 1200 adult Filipinos answered the survey. The survey has a small error of plus or minus 3%. The Philippine think tank Stratbase Institute asked for this survey to be done.</p>
            <p>People who answered "don't know" or refused to answer were not included. So, the total percentages in the survey might not be exactly 100%.</p>
            <p>Dindo Manhit, who leads Stratbase, said in a statement today that the big increase in Marcos Jr.'s public trust shows that people trust his government again.</p>
            <p>Manhit explained that Marcos Jr. must keep the people's trust because it shows if the government is stable and working well.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, this survey shows that 61% of people "trust" Sara Duterte "a lot," 14% "cannot decide," and 23% "trust her a little." Her net trust score is +38.</p>
            <p>In May, 60% of people "trusted" Sara Duterte "a lot," 16% "cannot decide," and 23% "trusted her a little." Her net trust score was +37.</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte ran for president and vice president together in the 2022 election. But after the election, they slowly grew apart because they had different political ideas and goals. They officially split in November last year. The next Philippine presidential election will be in 2028, and these two families will likely be opponents.</p>
            <p>Sara is currently facing efforts to remove her from office because of claims of corruption and trying to kill Marcos Jr. Her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, is also waiting for a trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands. This is because of claims that he violated human rights during his anti-drug actions when he was president.</p>

            <h1>Cheng Jin's Walk-Off Hit Wins Game for Rakuten Monkeys Over Brothers; Beau Sulser Pitches for a Long Time as Planned</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Taoyuan, 15th July) Today, the Rakuten Monkeys baseball team played against the CTBC Brothers. The Monkeys were behind by 5 points at one time. In the 6th inning, they tied the score. In the 9th inning, Cheng Jin hit a "walk-off" hit to win the game 6 to 5. Coach Ku Kubo Kenji explained the pitching plan. He said that the starting pitcher, Lin Zi-wei, had a limit on how many balls he could throw. So, it was planned for Beau Sulser to pitch for a long time after him.</p>
            <p>Today, the Monkeys played against the Brothers at their home stadium, Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium. In the top of the 2nd inning, the Brothers' Chan Tzu-hsien got a free base. Tseng Sung-en hit a single, and they moved to second and third base with a sacrifice hit. With two outs, Kao Yu-chieh hit a single to score the first run. Sung Sheng-jui then hit another single to score the second run.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 3rd inning, the Brothers started to score again. Chiang Kun-yu and Wang Wei-chen hit singles one after another. With two outs, Huang Wei-sheng hit a home run, scoring 3 points and giving his team a 5 to 0 lead.</p>
            <p>For the first 5 innings, the Monkeys' hitters could not score against the Brothers' starting pitcher, Cheng Hao-chun. In the bottom of the 6th inning, they found a chance when the Brothers changed pitchers. Chen Chen-wei, Cheng Jin, and Lin Chih-ping hit singles to score 1 run first. This also made the Brothers change their relief pitcher, Chen Kuan-ying. The next Brothers' pitcher, Hsieh Jung-hao, could not stop the Monkeys from scoring. Lin Cheng-fei hit a single to get another run. With two outs, Tseng Kuan-chieh hit a single, and Sung Chia-hsiang hit a single to score 2 runs. The Monkeys then got the tying run because of a mistake by the Brothers' defense.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 9th inning, with one out, Lin Cheng-hua and Chen Chen-wei hit singles one after another. Then, Cheng Jin hit a "walk-off" double to help his team win the game. This was Cheng Jin's third "walk-off" hit in his career. He was chosen as the best player of the game.</p>
            <p>The Monkeys' starting pitcher, Lin Zi-wei, pitched 3 innings and gave up 5 runs. He did not get the win or the loss. The foreign pitcher Beau Sulser pitched for 4 innings as a relief pitcher and did not give up any runs. Chu Cheng-yang and Chen Kuan-yu each pitched 1 inning and did not give up any runs. Chen Kuan-yu got the win.</p>
            <p>Coach Ku Kubo Kenji explained the pitching decisions. Because Lin Zi-wei had a limit on how many balls he could throw, they had planned before the game for Beau Sulser to pitch for a long time as a relief pitcher. Since last week, they had prepared Sulser in the bullpen. All the pitching plans for today were made before the game.</p>
            <p>Ku Kubo Kenji also said that this weekend is the All-Star game. He plans to send pitcher Lin Zi-wei to the minor league team to rest and get ready. He hopes Lin Zi-wei will prepare again for his next game.</p>
            <p>Talking about being behind in the first part of the game today, Ku Kubo Kenji also said that he felt the players wanted to fight back and score, even though they gave up many runs. Winning the game was because the hitters worked hard to score points.</p>

            <h1>Jones Cup "Family Fight": Liu Cheng's 17 Points Lead Taiwan Blue to Win Over Taiwan White</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Li Jian-cheng, Taipei, 15th July) Today, the Jones Cup International Basketball Invitational had a game where two teams from Taiwan played against each other, like "brothers fighting." The older team, Taiwan Blue, had all 11 players who played score points. Liu Cheng scored the most points for Taiwan Blue with 17. In the end, Taiwan Blue won 92 to 80 against Taiwan White.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Blue now has 3 wins and 1 loss. They only lost to the Philippines. They will rest tomorrow. Taiwan White now has 1 win and 2 losses. They only won their first game against Malaysia.</p>
            <p>In today's game between the two Taiwan teams, Taiwan Blue started strong in the first quarter. Ho-dan made two exciting dunks that made all the fans happy. But Taiwan White also scored well with 2 out of 8 three-point shots and some good drives to the basket. They stayed close to Taiwan Blue, with the score at 18 to 24.</p>
            <p>However, from the second quarter, Taiwan White's outside shots did not go in as much. Also, Taiwan Blue used their taller players, Joof Alasan and Brandon Gilbeck, to score inside the basket often. By the end of the first half, Taiwan Blue was leading 46 to 28.</p>
            <p>After changing sides, Taiwan Blue started the third quarter with a 10 to 0 scoring run, making their lead almost 30 points. By the end of the third quarter, they were far ahead, 71 to 46.</p>
            <p>In the last quarter, Taiwan White tried hard to come back. Lin Yen-ting, Yeh Wei-chieh, and others scored "three-point plays" (a basket and a free throw), making the score closer. With 5 minutes left in the game, Taiwan Blue had to put their main players back on the court. This helped them keep control of the score and win the game.</p>
            <p>For Taiwan Blue, besides Liu Cheng, Ho-dan scored 16 points and Ho-bo scored 12 points. For Taiwan White, Lin Yen-ting scored the most points with 16.</p>
            <p>Ho-dan spoke to the TV station and laughed, saying, "I said yesterday that even if we play against our own people, we will not take it easy. So, when I had a chance, I tried to dunk. It can make the whole team feel more excited."</p>
            <p>Liu Cheng said that playing against their own team is always harder. But he said that the players on the White team showed great determination and energy. "After these games, we still have some things to improve. Only then can we play well in the upcoming Asia Cup."</p>
