            <h1>New Taipei City to Hold Anti-Recall Event on July 19th; Mayor Hou Yu-ih Says He Will Stand with KMT Lawmakers</h1>
            <p>The Kuomintang (KMT) party will hold a big event against recall votes in New Taipei City on July 19th. When asked if he would join, New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih said today that he would stand with the KMT lawmakers from New Taipei City to face the challenges together.</p>
            <p>After leading a city meeting today, Mayor Hou Yu-ih talked to reporters. When asked if he would go to the big anti-recall event at Banqiao Stadium on July 19th, he said that the six KMT lawmakers from New Taipei City have truly worked hard for the people and for more building projects in New Taipei City. They also take responsibility for the country's stability and growth. He said, "For many years, I have seen that they really work hard."</p>
            <p>He said, "I will stand with our lawmakers from New Taipei City. We will face challenges together, and we will also work harder to listen to people's needs and solve their problems. We hope everyone can work hard together."</p>
            <p>Speaking about Premier Cho Jung-tai's view on giving out NT$10,000 cash to everyone, Mayor Hou Yu-ih said, "I want to remind the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) not to move further away from the people."</p>
            <p>He said that NT$10,000 might not seem like much to some people in the DPP. But for many ordinary people, "that NT$10,000 is for electricity bills, school fees, and many other costs." So, he said they should listen to the people's voices. He hopes the DPP will quickly follow the decision made by the Legislative Yuan. He believes this is the most important way to solve the people's problems.</p>

            <h1>Kinmen's Giant Otter "Art" Revealed to Promote Summer Family Carnival</h1>
            <p>To encourage family trips during the summer, the Kinmen County Government today showed off a 14-meter-tall otter balloon called "Art" at Jinhu Xincheng Park. The Tourism Department said that with the Kinmen Family Carnival, they invite families from all over Taiwan to visit Kinmen during the summer. They can take photos with Art and enjoy fun activities.</p>
            <p>To keep promoting summer family travel and attract tourists from both sides of the strait, the Kinmen County Government showed the "14-meter giant Art balloon" this afternoon at Jinhu Xincheng Park.</p>
            <p>Kinmen County Deputy Magistrate Li Wen-liang told reporters that the Kinmen Family Carnival will continue until the end of August. Many activities are ready for visitors during the summer. Today, in addition to showing Art, there are also other large cartoon figures like the Hoopoe bird and Wind Lion Gods at Xincheng Park. He hopes these figures will encourage visitors to take photos and join activities to win gifts. He welcomes both children and adults to visit Kinmen and make good summer memories for their children.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Department said in a press release that during the two months Art is on display, people can spend money at stores in Jinhu Township and take photos with Art. Then, they should tag "Kinmen Family Carnival" and "Kinmen Art" on their Facebook pages. After that, they can go to Xincheng 256 nearby and show their photo to get a free set of Art LINE stickers. There are only 300 sets available, until they run out.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Department also said that this year's Kinmen Family Carnival includes many activities all over the island. These include "Kinmen Family Experience Tour," "Island Life Festival," "Jinhu Beach Clam Festival," and "APP Search for Wind Lion God."

            <h1>NTNU Women's Football Blood-Drawing Case: Humanistic Education Foundation Says Review Committee Was Too Lenient</h1>
            <p>A coach for the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's football team threatened players to get blood drawn for research by saying he would take away their credits. Today, the Humanistic Education Foundation said that the school's bullying committee investigated and suggested firing the coach. However, the teacher review committee gave a lighter punishment and did not say why, which is hard to understand.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that because of the difference in the teacher's punishment, they will quickly hold a "Campus Bullying Incident Review Committee" meeting. They will carefully check the decision made by NTNU. If it is against the law or not right, they will send it back and ask for a new review.</p>
            <p>In a National Science and Technology Council project called "Building a Smart Sensing and Assessment Platform for Biopsychology, Injuries, and Performance of Next-Generation Female Football Players," the NTNU women's football coach asked players to have blood drawn three times a day for research. If students did not agree, he threatened to hold back their graduation credits. This caused a lot of anger in society.</p>
            <p>According to what a CNA reporter found out, after the NTNU Campus Bullying Prevention Committee reviewed the case, they suggested that the football coach involved "be fired and not be hired for two years." But later, the case went to the Teacher Review Committee. After three levels of review, they decided on five punishments, such as not giving a pay raise and not allowing extra teaching hours. However, being fired was not one of the punishments.</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan, the CEO of the Humanistic Education Foundation, told a CNA reporter by phone that some students who were harmed had their blood drawn 200 times over two or three years. The punishment from NTNU's teacher review committee almost only means the coach involved "cannot earn more money." It does not affect his teaching job at all. What is even harder to accept is that the committee did not explain its reasons, and the affected students only received the decision.</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan said that one reason for the lighter punishment from the teacher review committee, from what they understand, was that "the teacher showed regret," which she found funny. She pointed out that for cases in elementary and middle schools where students' rights are harmed, the review committees include outside members. Also, less than half of the teacher representatives are also in administrative roles. Although universities have three levels of review (department, college, and school), they are still mainly made up of teachers from inside the school. This makes it easier to make decisions that are good for the teachers.</p>
            <p>Someone who knows about bullying investigations told a CNA reporter that the NTNU Campus Bullying Prevention Committee's "suggestion" to fire the coach for two years was already quite light. It did not consider that the coach called the students back to scold them after the blood-drawing case became known. Normally, the teacher review committee usually follows the results and suggestions from the bullying investigation. However, NTNU's teacher review committee gave such a "light punishment," which is hard to understand. It might have only thought about the bullying part and not the "academic wrongdoing" part.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said today that they have not yet received NTNU's official document for approval. However, after looking at the school's decision mentioned yesterday, they found it did not follow the professional judgment and suggestions of the school's bullying investigation team. Therefore, the Ministry of Education will quickly hold a "Campus Bullying Incident Review Committee" meeting to carefully check the decision made by the teacher review committee. If it is against the law or not right, they will send it back and ask for a new review.</p>
