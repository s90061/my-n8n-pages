            <h1>Sri Lanka's New Government Arrests Former President for Corruption</h1>
            <p>Today, police in Sri Lanka arrested the country's former President, Wickremesinghe. They arrested him because they believe he was involved in corruption. This makes him the most important person from the opposition party to be arrested since President Dissanayake's new left-wing government started its fight against corruption.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that President Dissanayake won his election last September. He promised to fight corruption and beat Wickremesinghe. After he became president, the country's anti-corruption department started its work.</p>
            <p>A police officer in Sri Lanka told AFP that Wickremesinghe, who is 76 years old, was asked questions about a trip he made to London in September 2023. He went there for a ceremony for his wife at a British university. After the police asked him questions, they put him in custody.</p>
            <p>The police officer also stated that they charged Wickremesinghe with using money and resources from the country for his own personal reasons. The officer said, "We will give him to the judge in Colombo Fort to be judged."</p>
            <p>Before going to London, Wickremesinghe had gone to Havana, Cuba, for a big meeting called the G77 summit. On his way back, he stopped in London to be with his wife, Maithree. She was getting an award as an honorary professor from the University of Wolverhampton.</p>
            <p>The Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Sri Lanka said that Wickremesinghe used government money to pay for this personal trip. They also said that the government paid for his security guards during this time.</p>
            <p>Before this, Wickremesinghe's office had said that he did not use his power as president wrongly for his trip to London. He also said that his wife paid for her trip to the UK herself, and no government money was used.</p>
            <p>Since President Dissanayake became leader, several important politicians from the opposition in Sri Lanka have been put in jail for corruption. Some have received sentences of up to 25 years. Among these are two former ministers who held high positions.</p>

            <h1>Shiung Mou Company Fails to Pay 87.29 Million NT Dollars for Stock Deal, Largest Amount This Year</h1>
            <p>The stock market in Taiwan has been moving up and down a lot this week after reaching its highest points. Tonight, news came out about another big problem with paying for stock deals. The Taiwan Stock Exchange said tonight that two stock companies, Capital Securities Donghu and Hwanan Securities Fengyuan, reported that Shiung Mou Technology Co. Ltd. did not pay for a large stock deal. This company makes parts for electronics. The amount was 87.2956 million New Taiwan Dollars, which is the biggest amount this year.</p>
            <p>This is the second time this year that a company listed on the stock market has failed to pay for a big stock deal. Before this, on August 4th, stock companies also reported that Thunder Tiger Corporation failed to pay 58.7657 million New Taiwan Dollars. If we include companies listed on the main stock market and those traded outside it, this is the ninth big payment problem in the market this year.</p>
            <p>Taiwan uses a "T+2" system for stock payments. This means that a stock deal made on one day must be paid for two business days later. The Taiwan Stock Exchange announced this payment problem today, which means it happened from stock trades on Wednesday, August 20th. On that day, Shiung Mou's stock price went down by 10.6 New Taiwan Dollars. It closed the day at 95.9 New Taiwan Dollars, which was the lowest price it could go.</p>
            <p>Recently, there has not been enough of the basic materials needed to make PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards). This has caused the stock prices of companies related to PCBs to change a lot. The Taipei Exchange also said on August 19th that Capital Securities reported that Gold Circuit Electronics Ltd., a company that makes copper foil, also failed to pay 10.93 million New Taiwan Dollars for a stock deal.</p>
