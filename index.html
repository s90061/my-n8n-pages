            <h1>Hualien Government Helps Civet Baby Go Back to Nature</h1>
            <p>A civet mother animal likely died after being hit by a car in Hualien City. A civet baby was left alone. Staff from the county's Animal and Plant Disease Control Center heard about it and took the baby to a safe place. Today, they sent it to the Wild One Wildlife Rescue Center for care. After they check its health, they will let it go back to nature when the time is right.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government's Department of Agriculture said today that on the evening of September 15th, they received a call from the city office. Near 16 Gu Avenue and Zhongyang Road in the city, they found a dead civet mother animal, possibly hit by a car. There was also a young civet that was still alive. The staff from the Animal and Plant Disease Control Center took the baby civet that night. They checked the area for two days but did not find any other young civets.</p>
            <p>Because the young civet still needed its mother's milk, it needed special medical care and food. The county's Department of Agriculture quickly started rescue plans. Today, a special person took the baby civet to the "Wild One Wildlife Rescue Center" in Chishang, Taitung. There, it will get medical care, food, and training to live in the wild. This will help the young animal grow safely. Later, they will let it go back to nature.</p>
            <p>Chen Shu-wen, the head of the Department of Agriculture, said that civets are native medium-sized wild animals in Taiwan. They live in mountains, hills, and farms. They are very important for keeping nature balanced. But in recent years, many civets have been killed on roads by cars. This is one of the biggest dangers they face.</p>
            <p>She also said that October 4th is "World Animal Day." She wants to remind people to drive slowly in mountains, farmlands, or near rivers. They should watch the road carefully to stop wild animals from being hurt or killed when they cross roads.</p>
            <p>Chou Huang Te-jung, the head of the Hualien County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center, asked people to protect wild animals. He also told them to be careful about diseases that can spread between animals and humans. Hualien County still has a high risk of rabies. People must follow "two no's and one yes": do not abandon pets, do not touch or catch wild animals, and yes, get your dogs and cats vaccinated every year.</p>
            <p>Currently, rabies vaccination services for the second half of the year are available in Wanrong Township (October 27th to 31st) and Zhuoxi Township (November 4th to 21st). People can bring their pets to get vaccinated. For more information about dates, times, and places, you can check the Hualien County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center's official website, Facebook page, or ask your local government office.</p>

            <h1>Lee Jae-myung's First 100 Days: Time Magazine Talks About Trade Problems Between Korea and the US</h1>
            <p>Seoul, September 18 (CNA) â€” It has been just over 100 days since Lee Jae-myung became the President of South Korea. Today, Time magazine published an interview with him. The article praised Lee Jae-myung's good diplomacy when he met with US President Donald Trump in late August. But it also talked about the difficulties he faces in trade talks between South Korea and the United States.</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-myung, who is 61 years old, promised to invest 350 billion US dollars in the US and make other agreements on July 31st. In return, the US would lower its taxes on South Korean goods to 15%. Then, on August 25th, he went to the White House to meet President Trump.</p>
            <p>Time magazine reported that Lee Jae-myung showed great diplomatic skill at that time. He gave Trump a special golf club with Trump's name on it. He also gave two cowboy hats with "Make America Great Again" written on them, and a model of a "turtle ship," which is a symbol of Korea's shipbuilding history. When Trump said he liked Lee Jae-myung's pen, Lee Jae-myung also gave it to him.</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-myung also praised many things, from the nice new decorations in the White House's Oval Office and the rising stock market to Trump's diplomatic abilities.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting between the leaders of the US and South Korea, there was some worry. Hours earlier, Trump had posted on "Truth Social," a social media site, "What is going on in South Korea?" He also suggested that the investigation into former President Yoon Suk-yeol in South Korea seemed like a "purge or revolution." Lee Jae-myung's team worried that they might face a "diplomatic ambush," like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>
            <p>However, their meeting ended up being very friendly. Trump even called Lee Jae-myung "a very good person." Of course, besides gifts and compliments, Lee Jae-myung also brought a huge amount of money, 500 billion US dollars, which helped. Besides the 350 billion US dollars in investments that the US and South Korea had already agreed on, Lee Jae-myung announced another 150 billion US dollars in investments in the US. This included Korean Air buying Boeing airplanes worth 50 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>But after this, Lee Jae-myung faced tough questions about the 350 billion US dollar investment fund: Was all the investment in cash? Who would pay for any losses? Lee Jae-myung said that the US's demands were so strict that "if I accepted, I would be removed from office! So I asked the US negotiation team to suggest a more reasonable alternative."</p>
            <p>Time magazine noted that because the US and South Korea still have different ideas on these topics, Lee Jae-myung might have focused on praising Trump's earlier diplomatic success with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He also asked Trump to talk with North Korea again. Professor Naomi Ike from Hokkaido University in Japan said, "Lee Jae-myung might have brought up the North Korea issue to make Trump less focused on trade and investment problems."</p>
            <p>The leaders of the US and South Korea seem very different. Trump was born into a rich family, while Lee Jae-myung's father, who liked to gamble, was too poor to buy crayons. Trump has often been sued for treating workers badly, but Lee Jae-myung, as a lawyer for workers' rights, was happy to take companies that exploited workers to court. Trump supports conservative ideas, while Lee Jae-myung's Democratic Party keeps to left-wing progressive ideas.</p>
            <p>Despite these differences, Lee Jae-myung believes he can build a good relationship with Trump. This is because both of them had unusual lives growing up and are determined to succeed.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Democratic Party was not warm towards the US, was against Japan (a former colonial power), and preferred to build relationships with China.</p>
            <p>However, Lee Jae-myung visited Tokyo before his trip to Washington in late August. He said that the world's political situation has changed a lot. "We cannot go back to the old way where we relied on the US for safety and on China for our economy."</p>
            <p>According to Time magazine, Lee Jae-myung said that South Korea can be a "bridge" between powerful countries that are not friends. He also said, "Our values of democracy and a market economy are based on our alliance with the US."</p>
            <p>He also said, "But because we are close to China, and because of our shared history, economy, and people-to-people exchanges, we cannot completely cut off our ties with China. So, we need to manage our relationship well, and I believe the Western world should understand this."</p>
            <p>Regarding the issue of North Korea, Lee Jae-myung wants to have some contact with Kim Jong Un's government. This is to make North Korea stop making nuclear weapons and get some sanctions removed.</p>
            <p>He pointed out, "If we tell North Korea to stop, will they stop their plans? I believe that if we continue to put pressure on them now, then... North Korea will continue to make more nuclear bombs."</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-myung also said, "For the North Korea nuclear issue, we often think there are only two choices: either allow North Korea to have nuclear weapons, or make them get rid of all nuclear weapons. But I think there is a middle way... We can talk with North Korea to stop their nuclear and missile programs."</p>
