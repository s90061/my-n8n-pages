            <h1>Drones Enter Denmark's Airspace, NATO Strengthens Air Defense in Baltic Sea</h1>
            <p>NATO said today that it will improve its operations in the Baltic Sea area. This is because drones have recently flown into Danish airspace. NATO will send ships that can defend against air attacks and other equipment.</p>
            <p>Denmark's army said today that unknown drones were seen near some military places in Denmark last night. Also, earlier this week, drones flew into the airspace near airports and important buildings many times.</p>
            <p>Copenhagen Airport, which is the busiest in Northern Europe, was closed for several hours late on September 22. This happened because many large drones entered its airspace. In the days after, five other smaller airports in Denmark, used by both military and public, were also closed for a short time.</p>
            <p>NATO sent a statement to Reuters. It said that NATO will "increase its watch" in the Baltic Sea area with new types of equipment. This includes "tools for getting information, watching, and looking for things, and at least one warship that can stop air attacks."</p>
            <p>These new actions will make NATO's "Baltic Sentry" mission stronger. This mission started in January this year. It was created because underwater cables, phone networks, and gas pipes in the Baltic Sea were damaged many times. For this mission, NATO sent warships, patrol planes, and navy drones to help protect important structures.</p>
            <p>Also, this month, NATO started the "Eastern Sentry" mission. This mission is to make the eastern part of Europe safer. It is a response to Russian drones flying into Poland's airspace.</p>
            <p>On September 19, Estonia said that three Russian Mig-31 fighter jets flew into its airspace for 12 minutes. Italian planes from NATO then made them leave. On September 23, NATO warned Russia that it would use "all necessary military and non-military methods" to protect itself.</p>
            <p>Russia, however, said that its fighter jets did not fly into Estonian airspace. It also said that the drones did not plan to attack targets in Poland.</p>

            <h1>Russia Often Enters Airspace; Latvia Asks NATO to Improve Air Defense</h1>
            <p>Latvia's President Edgars Rinkevics today asked NATO to better protect the Baltic Sea countries. He said this because Russia has been flying into NATO airspace. Lithuania had also asked for similar help before.</p>
            <p>Leaders in Europe say that Russia has flown into NATO airspace many times. This includes the Baltic countries and Poland. Earlier this month, about 20 Russian drones flew into the airspace of these countries. This made NATO fighter jets shoot down some of the drones.</p>
            <p>At a NATO military meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia, Rinkevics said: "Russia continues to act in a way that causes problems. Recently, it has openly flown into the airspace of Poland and Estonia."</p>
            <p>He also said: "We should change the air watch mission in the Baltic Sea. It needs to become an air defense mission for the Baltic Sea, with rules for fighting. This should happen quickly."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that earlier this month, Lithuania's Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said that the Lithuanian government has a document ready. It suggests changing the mission to include more abilities, "like air defense equipment on land, sensors, and detectors."</p>
            <p>Russia said that its fighter jets did not fly into Estonian airspace. It also said that its drones did not plan to attack places in Poland.</p>
            <p>After the incident in Poland's airspace, NATO started "Operation Eastern Sentry." This operation is to make the whole eastern part of NATO stronger. But officials from the Baltic countries said they still need more protection.</p>
            <p>NATO makes decisions when all 32 member countries agree. It has not yet answered the request to change the mission. It also did not immediately comment on what Rinkevics said.</p>

            <h1>Russian Foreign Minister Says No Plan to Attack Europe, Warns of Strong Response if Attacked</h1>
            <p>Today, Sergey Lavrov, Russia's Foreign Minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He told world leaders that Russia does not plan to attack Europe. However, he warned that any aggressive action against Russia "will be answered strongly."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that in recent weeks, planes have flown into NATO airspace without permission. These incidents have been blamed on Russia, making Europe very alert. The situation became more tense after NATO planes shot down drones over Poland. Also, Estonia said that Russian fighter jets flew into its territory and stayed for 12 minutes.</p>
            <p>Russia said that its planes did not fly into Estonia. It also said that the drones were not meant to target Poland. Belarus, a friend of Moscow, said that signal jamming from Ukraine made the drones go off course. But European leaders believe these events are planned actions to challenge NATO and see how it reacts.</p>
            <p>However, Lavrov insisted that Russia is the one facing threats.</p>
            <p>He said: "Russia has never had, and does not now have, any intention (to attack European or NATO countries). But, any attack on our country will be answered strongly."</p>
            <p>This week, US President Trump said he believes Ukraine can take back all its land that Russia now controls.</p>
            <p>For the US leader, this was a big change in what he said. Before, he had said that Ukraine would need to give up some things. He also said that Ukraine could never get back all the areas Russia took after 2014 (Crimean Peninsula) and after the full invasion in 2022.</p>
            <p>Three weeks ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia and the United States "understand each other." He also said that Trump's government "is listening to us."</p>
            <p>Trump shared his new idea after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on September 23, during the UN General Assembly.</p>
