            <h1>Hsinchu City Committee Head Supports Ko Chien-ming; President Lai Ching-te Says No One is a Scapegoat</h1>
            <p>After a big recall election, some people in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) criticized Ko Chien-ming, the leader of the party's group in the Legislative Yuan. Today, Shi Nai-ru, the head of the DPP's Hsinchu City branch, spoke at a meeting for local party leaders. She said that supporters want the party to work together and not blame anyone. President Lai Ching-te, who is also the DPP chairman, said they are not looking for someone to blame. He said, "If you want to find someone to blame, blame me. I will take responsibility." He also said that whether the party's legislative group leaders should be re-elected is up to the group itself, and he will not get too involved.</p>
            <p>After the big recall election failed, some party members criticized Ko Chien-ming. There were also calls within the party to re-elect the leaders of the legislative group.</p>
            <p>The DPP held a meeting for local party leaders today. Those who were there said that during the last part of the meeting, Shi Nai-ru from Hsinchu City spoke up for Ko Chien-ming. She said that local supporters want the DPP to be united after August 23rd and not to look for a scapegoat.</p>
            <p>Those present said that Lai Ching-te mentioned the recall election result was not good. He said they are not looking for a scapegoat, and he takes all the responsibility. He said, "I am the scapegoat. If you want to find a scapegoat, find me. I will take responsibility."</p>
            <p>The local party leaders also said that Lai Ching-te clearly accepted responsibility. To deal with the future situation, the teams from the President's office, the Executive Yuan, and the party have made changes. As for the legislative group leaders, he respects the group's own decisions on how to handle it.</p>
            <p>Another person at the meeting said that Lai Ching-te said at the end of the temporary motion that the legislative group has the power to decide for itself. He could not say too much. The group should adjust its team itself, because it is not up to him to decide, "It's not an authoritarian era."</p>

            <h1>Hotai Motor's August Sales Set New Record for the Month; Aims for 36.7% New Car Market Share This Year</h1>
            <p>Car companies have started to announce their sales numbers for August. Hotai Motor reported its combined sales were 23.863 billion New Taiwan dollars. This is 15.09% more than last year and the highest ever for the month of August. For the first eight months of this year, Hotai Motor's sales were 186.956 billion New Taiwan dollars, which is 0.48% higher than in the same period of 2024.</p>
            <p>Hotai Motor said earlier that its brands, TOYOTA and LEXUS, sold a total of 11,914 cars in August. This is also the highest ever for August. Their share of the new car market in Taiwan was 40.4%, which is the highest for August in the last 15 years.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to September, Hotai Motor expects TOYOTA and LEXUS to sell 10,800 cars. This would be about 36% of the 30,000 new cars expected to be sold in Taiwan that month.</p>
            <p>For the whole new car market in Taiwan this year, Hotai Motor said earlier that changes in the car market are not very clear. The main thing they are unsure about this year is tariffs from the United States. The situation for the car market this year will become clearer after policies like tariffs are decided. Not having clear policies can affect some customers' desire to buy cars. However, Hotai Motor's process for delivering cars has become more stable.</p>
            <p>Looking at their sales goals for this year, Hotai Motor said they have not changed. They still plan to sell a total of 165,000 new passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and commercial vehicles. They want to reach a 36.7% market share this year. For TOYOTA cars, they expect to sell 130,000 units, making up 29% of the market. For LEXUS, they expect to sell 28,500 units, making up 6.3% of the market. For HINO, they expect to sell 6,350 units, making up 1.4% of the market.</p>
