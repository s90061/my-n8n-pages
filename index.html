            <h1>Cheng Li-wen, a Former DPP Member, Becomes KMT Chairperson</h1>
            <p>Former KMT legislator Cheng Li-wen has become the new chairperson of the Kuomintang (KMT) party. She was a surprise winner. She is known for her strong and brave style, which helped her win. She defeated other candidates like Hau Lung-pin, a former Taipei mayor, and Lo Chih-chiang, a KMT legislator.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen is the second woman to become KMT chairperson by direct vote from party members. The first was Hung Hsiu-chu.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen was born in Yunlin and grew up in Tainan. She studied law at National Taiwan University. During her time there, she took part in the Wild Lily student movement. After university, she joined the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). She worked as a National Assembly member and a leader in the DPP Youth Department. But in 2002, she left the DPP. This was after she talked about the "Tu Hsing-che ear-licking case" and the DPP stopped her party rights.</p>
            <p>After leaving the DPP, Cheng Li-wen stayed out of politics for some time. In 2004, she hosted a big protest for the Pan-Blue group against unfair presidential election results. This showed she supported the KMT side. Later that year, she ran for legislator in Kaohsiung but did not win.</p>
            <p>However, Cheng Li-wen is very good at speaking and explaining things clearly. Lien Chan, who was the KMT chairperson at the time, noticed her skills. In 2005, she was asked to join the KMT. She then became the head of the KMT's Culture and Communications Committee and a spokesperson. In the 2008 election, she became a legislator. But in 2012, she tried to become a regional legislator in Taichung and lost to a DPP legislator.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen was brave to run in difficult election areas. This made her seem like a fighter, which is rare for the KMT. After losing the election, Chen Chun, who was the Premier at the time, asked her to be the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan. She was highly trusted.</p>
            <p>In 2014, Cheng Li-wen left her job as spokesperson. She then worked in media and hosted TV shows. In the 2020 election, Wu Den-yih, the KMT chairperson at the time, chose her to be a legislator again. She returned to the Legislative Yuan and later became the KMT party whip.</p>
            <p>During this time, the world had the COVID-19 pandemic. As the party whip, Cheng Li-wen was a strong voice for the KMT. She asked tough questions and fought hard for the party.</p>
            <p>In this KMT chairperson election, Cheng Li-wen was a surprise candidate. She visited many local communities and showed a fighting spirit that was different from traditional KMT politicians. Many people in the military, government, and education fields supported her. She finally beat her opponents and became the party chairperson.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen is now the KMT chairperson, but she did not come from a traditional KMT background. The KMT is a complex party with many local powers. She also needs to work carefully with the Taiwan People's Party. Her challenge has just begun to help the KMT win back power in 2028.</p>
