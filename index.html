            <h1>Monitoring Group: Cluster Bombs Have Killed or Injured Over 1200 Civilians in Ukraine Since 2022</h1>
            <p>A report from a monitoring group today says that since Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022, cluster bombs have caused more than 1200 civilian deaths or injuries there. This shows a "worrying step backward" in global efforts to get rid of these weapons.</p>
            <p>The Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) said in its yearly report that Ukraine has the highest number of cluster bomb casualties each year since the war started.</p>
            <p>The report states that Russia has "widely" used these weapons, which are generally banned around the world, since the first day of the war. Also, Ukraine has used cluster bombs and has been accused of using them inside Russia.</p>
            <p>In 2024 alone, Ukraine recorded at least 193 incidents where cluster bombs caused harm. This is most of the 314 cases worldwide. Since the war began, over 1200 people in Ukraine have been hurt or killed by cluster bombs. Most of these incidents happened in 2022.</p>
            <p>However, the report also says that the real numbers are probably much higher than reported. Last year alone, there were about 40 cluster bomb attacks in Ukraine where no exact numbers of casualties were given.</p>

            <h1>UK Drops Spy Charges Against Two British Men for China; Prosecutors Say Not Enough Evidence</h1>
            <p>British prosecutors said today that they will no longer charge two British men who were thought to be spying for China. One of the men was a former researcher who worked for a British Member of Parliament. Prosecutors said there was not enough evidence to continue the case.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the two men, 30-year-old former researcher Christopher Cash and 33-year-old Christopher Berry, are both British citizens. They were supposed to go to trial next month and both said they were not guilty of any crimes.</p>
            <p>Tom Little, the prosecutor for the case, said at the Old Bailey Court in London that after looking at the evidence again, the prosecutors felt there was not enough. So, they decided to stop the charges. He said, "We cannot continue to charge them."</p>
            <p>The British government said it was sad that it could not prosecute the two men.</p>
            <p>The two men were first accused of giving secret information to Chinese people. This broke the Official Secrets Act.</p>
            <p>James Mulholland, Cash's lawyer, said that Cash used to work for the China Research Group in Parliament. He said that his client was completely innocent and should not have been arrested or charged.</p>
            <p>Cash said outside the court that he was happy the legal system finally showed he was innocent. But he added that the past two and a half years have been a "nightmare" for him and his family. He also hopes that society can learn from this case.</p>
            <p>The two men were first arrested in March 2023 and formally charged in April 2024. Prosecutors said they gave information that harmed the country between December 2021 and February 2023, which broke the Official Secrets Act.</p>
            <p>According to the "Sunday Times" newspaper, when Cash was arrested, he was a parliamentary researcher for Conservative MP Alicia Kearns. At that time, Kearns was the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors said that the two men were close friends. Berry reportedly held several jobs in China starting in 2015. Prosecutors also said the two men were thought to have given sensitive political information to Chinese intelligence officers, but they did not give specific evidence.</p>
            <p>This case is one of several recent cases in the UK about accusations of Chinese spying. This shows that national security issues are very important.</p>
            <p>The British government has warned before that Chinese intelligence agencies are actively trying to get into British politics, defense, and business to collect secret information.</p>
            <p>The UK Home Office said in a statement, "Considering how serious the accusations are, it is disappointing that the accused cannot be tried." It also said that the decision to drop the case was made by the prosecutors alone and was not related to the government's views.</p>
            <p>The Home Office also said that the government will continue to use different ways and powers to stop bad actions from other countries.</p>
            <p>The Chinese government has often said that these accusations are not true. They said the claims against Berry and Cash were made up and criticized Western countries for "spreading bad rumors."</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in the UK has not yet made a new comment about this.</p>
