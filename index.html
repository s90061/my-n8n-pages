            <h1>Hsieh Kuo-liang, Chiu Pei-lin Each Donate One Month's Salary to Help Hualien</h1>
            <p>Hualien's Guangfu Township was badly hit by the overflow from the Mata'an River landslide dam lake. Keelung City Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang and Deputy Mayor Chiu Pei-lin each gave one month of their salary. The Keelung City Government also worked with kind citizens to donate NT$2 million through a special social welfare fund. This is to help Hualien get through this difficult time.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Kuo-liang said in a press release today that he hopes this act will encourage more companies, groups, and people to help. They want everyone to work together to help Hualien rebuild. The Keelung City Government will keep looking at its resources to give more help to Hualien. It also asks everyone in society to join in and support Hualien strongly.</p>
            <p>Also, yesterday, the Keelung City Government's Public Works Department and Environmental Protection Bureau sent 13 different types of vehicles, machines, and 25 workers to help Hualien. They arrived at the site around 11 PM. This morning, they received their tasks and started clearing about 400 meters of mud from Futian First Street.</p>

            <h1>International Medical Staff See Severe Injuries in Gaza Civilians, Children's Burns Show Bone and Flesh</h1>
            <p>A new study was published today. It says that international medical workers helped Palestinians in hospitals in the Gaza Strip during the Israel-Hamas war. These workers say that the injuries people in Gaza got were worse than what civilians usually suffer in other wars today.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported on this study. It was published in the well-known "British Medical Journal" (BMJ). 78 medical aid workers, mostly from Europe and North America, took part in a survey for the study. They described how bad, where on the body, and what caused the injuries they saw while working in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>The main writer of the study, British surgeon Omar El-Taji, told AFP that two-thirds of the medical workers had worked in other war zones before. Most of them said that the injuries they saw in the Gaza Strip were "the worst they had ever seen."</p>
            <p>The study found more than 23,700 cases of trauma and almost 7,000 wounds from weapons. These numbers are similar to the statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
            <p>The study calls the injuries of people in the Gaza Strip "unusually severe." More than two-thirds of the weapon-related wounds were caused by explosions. This happened because of strong bombing and shelling by the Israeli army in the area.</p>
            <p>The study also said that this number is more than twice the number of civilians injured by explosions in other modern wars.</p>
            <p>The study writes: "The number, spread, and severe nature of the injuries show that the pattern of harm in the Gaza Strip is much worse than anything recorded in past modern conflicts."</p>
            <p>El-Taji also talked about the unusually high number of third-degree or fourth-degree burns among the injured. These types of burns go deep through all layers of skin, under the skin, and even into muscles and bones.</p>
            <p>El-Taji said he saw something shocking in the Gaza Strip last year: "Many injured children were brought in. Their burns were so bad that you could really see their muscles and bones."</p>
            <p>Also, not getting enough food (malnutrition) and not drinking enough water (dehydration) are very common illnesses in the Gaza Strip. Last month, the "Integrated Food Security Phase Classification" (IPC), which is supported by the United Nations, officially said that some areas there are now facing famine.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Culture Bureau Director Charged for Benefiting Businesses and Falsely Reporting Ritual Expenses</h1>
            <p>The head of Hualien County Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau and a section chief let the "General's Residence Park" open for business before it passed inspections. They are accused of helping businesses unfairly. They also reported higher costs for ceremonies to help spirits and worship local gods. Today, the Hualien District Prosecutor's Office charged both of them under the Anti-Corruption Act.</p>
            <p>The Hualien District Prosecutor's Office received a report. It said that some parts of the "General's Residence 1936 Park," which the Cultural Affairs Bureau hired a company to manage, did not follow the rules. But Wu Chin-yi, the head of the bureau, and Tseng Chun-hsiang, a section chief, still let the company start trial operations and then official operations. Also, they wrongly reported small purchases for hiring Taoist priests for rituals and prayers. Wu Chin-yi is also accused of using a government car for personal reasons.</p>
            <p>Prosecutor Hsiao Pai-lin from the Hualien District Prosecutor's Office led the investigation. The investigation was done by the Northern District Investigation Division of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau. Today, they finished the investigation and charged them with corruption.</p>
            <p>Wu Chin-yi was held during the investigation. This morning, his case was sent to court. The Hualien District Court has not yet made a decision by noon today. Tseng Chun-hsiang, who was released on bail earlier, told a CNA reporter by phone that he will let his lawyer and the court find out the truth of the matter.</p>
            <p>The Hualien District Prosecutor's Office sent out a press release. It stated that Wu had been the head of the Hualien County Cultural Affairs Bureau since September 15, 2020. Tseng had been the section chief of the Bureau's Administration and Cultural Facilities Section since December 7, 2021.</p>
            <p>In 2023, both of them handled the public contract for managing the "Meilun River Japanese Dormitory Group" (General's Residence Park). In May of last year, the General's Residence Park had not yet received permission to operate. But they let the park run and make money, calling it "stress testing" or "trial operations." This unfairly helped the company earn NT$632,300.</p>
            <p>The indictment also said that after Wu became the head of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, he often reported higher costs for projects. He claimed these were for folk customs, such as inviting masters to inspect sites, holding ceremonies for the dead, worshiping local gods, and rituals for starting, putting up beams, and finishing construction. These extra funds were allegedly used to pay off debts to temples. At the same time, he was also involved in several cases of using a government car for personal use.</p>
