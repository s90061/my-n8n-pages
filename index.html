            <h1>Micron Expects High First Quarter Sales Due to Strong AI Demand</h1>
            <p>Micron Technology expects good sales for its first quarter. This is because there is a lot of demand for its special memory chips called HBM. These chips are very important for companies working on Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that businesses are building advanced AI models and making their data centers bigger. This has caused a big increase in the need for Micron's HBM chips.</p>
            <p>TSMC will work with Micron to make the basic parts for Micron's new HBM4E chips. This includes both custom-made and standard versions.</p>
            <p>Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world. Because of this, big memory chip makers are trying hard to become a main supplier for Nvidia. Micron already provides some HBM chips used in Nvidia's products.</p>
            <p>Micron's CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in a meeting about money that the company's HBM sales in the fourth quarter grew to almost 2 billion US dollars. This means yearly sales could be nearly 8 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>HBM stands for High Bandwidth Memory. It is a type of DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). These chips are stacked on top of each other to use less power. They can handle a lot of data quickly, which is key for AI development.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mehrotra also said that Micron expects to finish contracts soon. These contracts will make sure all HBM chips for the year 2026 are sold. The prices for HBM3E chips are mostly set. However, talks for the newer HBM4 chips are still happening.</p>
            <p>Sumit Sadana, Micron's chief business officer, stated that "HBM4 prices are much higher than HBM3E prices. The market is very competitive. So, we expect our HBM business to make a lot of money."</p>
            <p>Micron believes its sales for the first quarter will be around 12.5 billion US dollars. This could be 300 million dollars more or less. Experts from LSEG thought sales would be 11.94 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Micron also expects its profit margin to be 51.5%, which is much higher than the 45.9% experts predicted.</p>
            <p>Jin-Gai Chen, an analyst at Summit Insights, a financial advice company, said that the profit margin went up because "prices were better than expected."</p>
            <p>Micron's adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter was 3.03 US dollars. This was better than what experts thought.</p>
            <p>Also, Micron received 6.2 billion US dollars from the government. This money came from the "CHIPS and Science Act," which former US President Biden started.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mehrotra mentioned that Micron got the "CHIPS Act" money in the fourth quarter. This happened after they finished an important part of building their factory in Idaho.</p>

            <h1>Lotus Pharmaceutical Spends NT$20 Billion to Buy NAGH, Becomes a Top 20 Global Special Drug Company</h1>
            <p>Lotus Pharmaceutical, a drug company, announced today that it has signed a final agreement. The company will buy all shares of New Alvogen Group Holdings, Inc. (NAGH) for about 658 million US dollars (about 20 billion New Taiwan dollars). This means Lotus will own Alvogen US, which is a private drug company in America. This purchase will make Lotus one of the top 20 special drug companies in the world.</p>
            <p>Shen Yeh, the Vice President of Lotus, said that after the deal is done, the total sales and profits (before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) will double. This deal gives Lotus more types of products, increasing its total products to almost 100. A special sales team in the US will make Lotus's business stronger. Lotus will also benefit from a local factory that has a good record with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).</p>
            <p>He said that this deal brings together two big drug companies. It adds US research, manufacturing, and business skills to Lotus's strengths in Asia. This will allow Lotus to sell its special medicines worldwide and enter the largest medicine market in the world, helping it grow in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shen also stated that the total value of the companies in this deal is about 2 billion US dollars (60.578 billion New Taiwan dollars). The deal includes cash, special shares, and bonus payments linked to future performance. The deal still needs approval from the right government authorities.</p>

            <h1>Caihsia Tunnel Filled with Mudslide, Southern Cross-Island Highway Taitung Section to Reopen by Evening of 25th</h1>
            <p>Due to many days of rain, the Southern Cross-Island Highway in Taitung has many landslides and mudslides. The section from Xiangyang to Chulai has been affected. The Caihsia Tunnel is now full of mud and rocks. The road is expected to be clear again by the evening of the 25th.</p>
            <p>The Guanshan Road Maintenance Section of the Highway Bureau said this morning that Typhoon Huajia Sha caused more than 550 millimeters of heavy rain in Haiduan Township, Taitung County, in the last 24 hours. Because of this, parts of Highway 20, from kilometer 149+110 to 199+000 (Xiangyang to Chulai), were closed as a safety measure.</p>
            <p>Early this morning, workers from the Guanshan Road Maintenance Section checked the road. They found that the roadbed collapsed at kilometer 150+100. Also, there were many landslides and mudslides at other places, such as 155+100, 161+100, 163+000, 170+100, 179+200, 180+100, 181+800, 185+600, 188+600 (Caihsia Tunnel), and 190+600. These blocked both sides of the road. The Caihsia Tunnel was specifically filled with a mudslide.</p>
            <p>The Guanshan Road Maintenance Section said that they have sent workers and machines to clean the road. They expect to open the road by 5 PM on the 25th. The section also reminds visitors who want to go to the mountains to check road closure times and conditions. Before going up, it is very important to check the weather. If it is raining or foggy, it is best to avoid going to the mountains.</p>
