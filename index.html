            <h1>Democratic Lawmaker Shows Nasty Letter Said to Be From Trump; White House Says No</h1>
            <p>A Democratic member of the US House of Representatives shared a letter today. They said it was a rude letter written by former President Trump. The letter was a birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein, a rich person who committed sex crimes, in 2003. The White House later said this was not true.</p>
            <p>In mid-July, the "Wall Street Journal" reported that Ghislaine Maxwell, a British woman who knows many famous people, put together a collection of birthday letters Epstein received for his 50th birthday in 2003. This collection included a rude letter with Trump's signature. It had some typed words, and a hand-drawn picture of a naked woman's outline.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal article said: "The person who later became president signed 'Donald' in a curvy way below her waist, making it look like pubic hair. The letter ended with 'Happy Birthday, may every day be another beautiful secret.'" Trump said this report was false.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is looking into how Epstein's criminal cases were handled. CNBC, an American news channel, said that the screenshot of the letter shared by Democratic members of the committee on social media today matched what the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>
            <p>The White House said today that Trump did not sign or draw a birthday card for Epstein.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, wrote on X (a social media platform): "As I have said many times, this drawing was clearly not drawn by President Trump, and he did not sign it."</p>
            <p>Leavitt also said that the reports about this rude letter were "false." She added that Trump's legal team will continue to take legal action against the Wall Street Journal.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Rise Slightly as Market Considers OPEC+ Production Increase</h1>
            <p>Today, international oil prices went up a little. This happened as the market thought about two things: the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) decided to increase oil production slightly in October, and Saudi Aramco lowered the price of crude oil it sells to Asia.</p>
            <p>The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for October delivery, traded in New York, increased by 39 cents. It reached 62.26 US dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>The price of Brent crude oil for November delivery, traded in London, went up by 52 cents. It reached 66.02 US dollars per barrel.</p>
