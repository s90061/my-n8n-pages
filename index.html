            <h1>Taiwan's CFO Team Wins LCP League, Heads to World Championship as Top Seed</h1>
            <p>The Taiwanese team, CFO (Chinatrust Flying Oyster), won the championship. They beat the local team, TSW (Team Secret Whales), 3-0 in the final of the League of Legends LCP league's third part. The game took place in Vietnam. CFO will now go to the World Championship as "Pacific Kings."</p>
            <p>CFO has not lost a game in the Pacific Professional League (LCP) for more than half a year. In the "Season Finals" of the third part, they showed how strong they were. They stayed undefeated and moved on to the final. Now, they have beaten TSW from Vietnam 3-0. The team was happy to lift the championship cup. They will also go to the World Championship as the top team from the LCP league to compete with other strong teams.</p>
            <p>After the game, HongQ (Cai Ming-hong) talked to reporters. He is a new "monster" player who plays in the middle of the game and was named the most valuable player (FMVP) in the final. He said he was very happy to win the championship. He also praised his teammates for playing very well and winning the game easily. Even though they had not played for a while and were not used to the game place, everyone quickly adjusted. He added that he found a chance on the side in the third game, which worked very well and helped them win.</p>
            <p>Chawy (Huang Hsin-lei), the coach of CFO, said that winning all three parts of the LCP league this season was more than he expected. He said the biggest reason was how much HongQ improved in a short time. He gave the players more than 100 points. "Everyone played very well. Also, the team spirit was good. When mistakes happened, we encouraged each other instead of blaming. This helped everyone improve quickly."</p>
            <p>HongQ said he is very excited but also a little nervous about going to the World Championship and playing against strong teams. He hopes everyone stays in their current good condition and does not relax before the World Championship. He wants them to try their best in every game. Chawy shared that he is not a coach who sets goals. He only hopes that the players play well in every game and enjoy the process of playing.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Kaphaga Continues to Get Stronger, Winds Near Center Reach 58 Meters Per Second</h1>
            <p>The weather office said that Typhoon Kaphaga is in a good environment to get stronger. In the past 3 hours, it has gotten stronger again. The fastest wind speed near its center is now 58 meters per second. It is expected to get even stronger in the next 6 to 12 hours. The area with strong winds is also expected to get bigger. However, its effect on Taiwan will still be the same as what was thought before.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau observed Typhoon Kaphaga at 11 PM today. Its center was at 19.0 degrees North latitude and 124.8 degrees East longitude. This is about 520 kilometers southeast of Eluanbi. It is moving west at 21 kilometers per hour. The strongest wind speed near its center is 58 meters per second (about 209 kilometers per hour). This is like a level 17 wind. The strongest quick burst of wind is 73 meters per second (about 263 kilometers per hour). This is like a wind stronger than level 17.</p>
            <p>The weather office pointed out that Kaphaga has gotten a little stronger in the past 3 hours. Its center is now in the sea southeast of Eluanbi and is moving west. It will be a danger to Taitung, Pingtung, and the Hengchun Peninsula. In the future, it is expected to get a little stronger, and the area with strong winds might also get a little bigger.</p>
            <p>Lin Po-tung, a weather forecaster, said that Kaphaga is currently in a good place and has good weather conditions to grow. Also, the structure near its center has changed a little. Because of this, Kaphaga's strongest wind speed near its center has increased to 58 meters per second. It is expected to keep moving west towards the Bashi Channel. It will get stronger in the next 6 to 12 hours, and the area with strong winds will also get bigger. However, the estimated impact on Taiwan is still the same as before.</p>
            <p>Lin Po-tung said that for wind, in the next 36 hours, strong winds will not be clear in most parts of Taiwan. They will be mainly in the south. In the next 18 hours, the area with strong winds will grow and get stronger. The Hengchun Peninsula will have strong winds of level 12 to 13 from tomorrow morning to afternoon. Orchid Island and Green Island will have strong winds of level 12 to 13 during the day tomorrow. Taitung will also have strong winds of level 10 tomorrow afternoon.</p>
            <p>The weather office also continues to give warnings for strong winds. From tonight until tomorrow night, some areas in Orchid Island, Green Island, and Pingtung County might have average winds of level 9 or stronger, or sudden strong winds of level 11 or stronger (orange warning). Some areas in Keelung City, Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, Miaoli County, Taichung City, Nantou County, Changhua County, Yunlin County, Chiayi County, Kaohsiung City, Yilan County, Hualien County, Taitung County, Penghu County, Kinmen County, and Lienchiang County might have average winds of level 6 or stronger, or sudden strong winds of level 8 or stronger.</p>
            <p>Regarding rain, Lin Po-tung said that based on the rain forecast, Yilan, Hualien, and the North Coast will have heavy rain or very heavy rain in some areas tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, the North Coast of Keelung, the eastern part, and the Hengchun Peninsula will also have more noticeable rain. Tomorrow afternoon, the rain will get stronger. Yilan, Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have heavy rain or very heavy rain in some areas.</p>
            <p>Lin Po-tung pointed out that tomorrow night, Kaphaga will slowly pass through the southern part of the Bashi Channel. After the wind direction changes, the rain in Yilan will become lighter. However, the rain in Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula will continue. It might even spread to the mountainous areas of Kaohsiung and Pingtung. On the 23rd, Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have very heavy rain or worse all day.</p>
            <p>Lin Po-tung said that although there will not be much rain in the western part of Taiwan, the central area will have high temperatures. This is because of the typhoon's outer winds pushing air down. Especially in Miaoli, Taichung, Changhua, and Yunlin, temperatures could reach 36 degrees Celsius, or even higher than 37 degrees Celsius.</p>
