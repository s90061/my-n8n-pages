            <h1>Putin Praises Trump's Desire to Understand Problem, Asks Ukraine and Europe Not to Harm Peace Process</h1>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin met with US President Donald Trump in Alaska on August 15th. After their meeting, Putin said he was happy that Trump wanted to understand the main reasons and nature of the conflict in Ukraine. He called their talks helpful and said they happened in a friendly and respectful way. He hopes the understanding between the US and Russia will lead to peace in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Putin said he hopes Ukraine and European countries will work together with the US and Russia to achieve peace. He asked them not to create problems for peace or try to stop progress with tricks or secret actions.</p>
            <p>Putin and Trump talked for over two hours. Their foreign ministers and special assistants were also there. After the talks, they held a press conference but did not take questions from reporters.</p>
            <p>Besides Ukraine, Putin talked a lot about making US-Russia relations normal again. He said it's important to move from conflict to working together in practical ways. He also mentioned that the US helped the Soviet Union in World War II. He said the US and Russia have a history of fighting common enemies together. This is different from how Moscow usually talks about World War II, where they say the Soviet Union was the only good side and the West was ungrateful after the war.</p>
            <p>Putin said that the International Date Line is between the US and Russia. He hopes their relationship can also turn a new page, moving from "yesterday" to "tomorrow" in politics. Putin said that in the last four years, US-Russia relations were at their worst since the Cold War ended. He said this was not good for either country or for the world.</p>
            <p>Putin said that the last time he spoke with the US government in 2022, he tried to tell the US President, Joe Biden, that it was "not necessary to make the situation so bad that it would lead to serious results like military action." He said he clearly told Biden it was a "big mistake."</p>
            <p>Putin said he agrees with Trump that if Trump had been the US President at that time, the US would not have called it a war. Putin said again that he and Trump have a very good, practical, and trusting direct relationship. He believes that if they continue like this, the conflict in Ukraine can end soon, and the sooner the better.</p>
            <p>In terms of trade, Putin said that since Trump's government started in January this year, trade between the US and Russia has grown by 20%. Putin said the US and Russia have great potential for trade and investment cooperation, especially in areas like the Arctic, energy, digital technology, high technology, and space. He also said it's important to start local-level talks again, including between Russia's Far East and the US West Coast.</p>
            <p>Putin said the US and Russia are close neighbors, with only the Bering Strait between them. When he arrived in Alaska, he called Trump "dear neighbor" as he got off the plane, which sounded friendly. Putin also mentioned that Alaska has many signs of shared US-Russia history, such as old Russian Orthodox churches, over 700 places with Russian names, and graves of Soviet pilots.</p>
            <p>On the topic of Ukraine, Putin's words did not change much. He said Russia still sees Ukraine as a "brother country," so the events in Ukraine are a sad and painful thing for Russia. He said Russia "truly" wants the conflict to end.</p>
            <p>Putin repeated that what is happening in Ukraine is a "basic threat to Russia's national security." To solve the situation in Ukraine in a lasting and stable way, he said "all" the main reasons for the crisis must be removed, and Russia's "fair and legal" worries must be considered.</p>
            <p>Putin said that a "fair balance" must be brought back in terms of safety in Europe and around the world. He said he completely agrees with Trump that Ukraine's safety must also be ensured, and Russia is "certainly willing to work for this."</p>
            <p>Russia fully attacked Ukraine in February 2022. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for Putin's arrest for war crimes.</p>

            <h1>After Reports of Detention, China's Vice Minister Sun Haiyan Attends Reception</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported on August 15th that Sun Haiyan, the Vice Minister of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was held in early August because of a case involving Minister Liu Jianchao. However, according to the department's official website, Sun Haiyan attended a reception in Beijing on the evening of August 15th to celebrate India's Independence Day. When a Reuters reporter at the event asked Sun Haiyan questions, she did not directly say if the authorities had held her or questioned her. She only said, "I am right here."</p>
            <p>On August 15th, Reuters quoted three unnamed sources who said that Sun Haiyan was held because of Liu Jianchao's case. Sun Haiyan's last public appearance was on July 31st, when she attended an event for a Russian political party.</p>
            <p>The report at that time said it was not possible to confirm if Sun Haiyan and Liu Jianchao were still being held, and they could not be reached for comment.</p>
            <p>According to the International Liaison Department's official website, Sun Haiyan met with the Indian Ambassador to China, Pradeep Rawat, in Beijing on August 15th. She was also invited to attend the reception held by the Indian Embassy in China to celebrate India's Independence Day.</p>
            <p>In the early morning of August 16th, Reuters also reported that Sun Haiyan attended a diplomatic event in Beijing on the evening of August 15th. The report said that when Sun Haiyan answered questions from a Reuters reporter at the event, she did not directly say if the authorities had held her or questioned her. She only said, "I am right here," and called Reuters' report "irresponsible."</p>
            <p>Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao reported on August 16th that, according to two sources, the reports of Sun Haiyan being held were not true, and she had been working normally for the past two days.</p>
            <p>The report said that the nature of Sun Haiyan being questioned is not clear. It is understood that in the Chinese government system, when a leader in a team has problems, other team members are usually questioned. This is so that higher-ups or investigation departments can understand their views on the problem and ask them to state their position. However, these kinds of questions usually happen within the department, and being taken away would be unusual.</p>
            <p>At the time this article was written, the International Liaison Department's official website still had information about Liu Jianchao and Sun Haiyan.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Putin Finish Alaska Talks; Their Planes Leave Separately</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin finished their meeting in Alaska today, which was about the war between Russia and Ukraine. After the meeting, their planes left the military base in Alaska one after another.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Russia fully invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The two sides have been fighting for more than three years. Trump and Putin talked for about three hours about this. After the meeting, their private planes took off from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson within minutes of each other.</p>
