            <h1>New York State Approves New Underground Power Line; Micron's Mega-Fab Plan Moves Forward</h1>
            <p>New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the New York State Public Service Commission has approved a new underground power line. This line will connect the Clay substation to the very large chip factory that Micron Technology plans to build in Onondaga County.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this power line, which is over 3 kilometers long, is a very important part of Micron Technology's 100 billion US dollar investment in central New York. This investment is for making semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Governor Hochul said in a press release on October 16 that this is the biggest private investment in New York State's history.</p>
            <p>This plan is expected to create more than 50,000 jobs over the next 20 years. This includes 9,000 direct jobs within Micron.</p>
            <p>Hochul said, "This project will completely change central New York. We are moving forward very quickly and carefully."</p>
            <p>Micron and New York State agreed in 2022 to build an advanced manufacturing site there. This very large chip factory aims to produce about a quarter of all semiconductors in the U.S. by 2030.</p>

            <h1>KMT Chairman Election in Pingtung: Fake Ballot Claim; Su Ching-chuan Says a 5-Person Group Will Investigate</h1>
            <p>Today, during the Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman election, a supervisor named Ko from candidate Hau Lung-pin's team took someone else's ballot in Gaoshu Township, Pingtung County. Su Ching-chuan, who is the chairman of the Pingtung County KMT branch, said that a small group of 5 people is now looking into the matter. The results will be sent to the KMT headquarters and handled according to the party's rules.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County KMT branch said in a press release today that election staff in Gaoshu Township checked the ballots. They found that supervisor Ko seemed to have taken another person's ballot. After checking, supervisor Ko admitted that what he did was wrong. They stopped that ballot from being used and told the county branch to record it and check it further.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County KMT branch also said that supervisor Ko wrote a statement by himself. He said that a supporter of a candidate did it for convenience and didn't think about the rules. This person did not care about the fairness and image of the election, and supervisor Ko felt very sorry for his actions.</p>
            <p>Su Ching-chuan told the Central News Agency that the 5-person group is investigating. The full results will definitely be sent to the KMT headquarters. They will follow the party's rules to keep the election fair and right.</p>
