The Israeli army attacked three ports and one power plant in Yemen early this morning. This was the first time Israel attacked Yemen in nearly a month.

Israel said they attacked these places because the Houthi group in Yemen had attacked Israel many times. They also attacked a cargo ship called Galaxy Leader, which the Houthi group took in late 2023.

The Houthi group's TV station said that Israel warned people to leave the three ports before attacking them. A few hours before Israel's attack, a ship was attacked in the Red Sea, near the Hodeidah port. The crew had to leave the ship because water got inside.

Since the war in Gaza started in October 2023, the Houthi group, which is supported by Iran, has attacked Israel and ships in the Red Sea many times. They do this to support Palestine, and these actions have caused problems for trade around the world.

**Taiwan Train Services Stopped Due to Typhoon Danas**

Due to Typhoon Danas, some Taiwan Railway services were stopped this morning. All trains on the western main line were stopped until noon. Also, trains between Douliu and Tainan, and on three smaller lines, were stopped because signals were broken.

The typhoon landed in Chiayi last night, causing strong winds and rain in central and southern Taiwan. This led to trees falling, metal sheets on the tracks, and damage to power lines and signal equipment.

Taiwan Railway announced that some long-distance trains from Keelung to Chaozhou on the western line are stopped. However, trains on the North-Link line (Shulin to Hualien), South-Link line (Xin Zuoying to Taitung), and Taitung line (Taitung to Hualien) are running normally, but this might change based on the weather. For local trains, services between Keelung and Douliu, and Tainan to Chaozhou to Taitung are normal. But trains between Douliu and Tainan, and on the Pingxi, Shen'ao, Neihuan, and Jiji lines are stopped.

**Taiwan Stock Market to Be Unstable Before Tariff Deadline**

The deadline for new tariffs from the US is coming on July 9th, and the market is waiting to see what happens. A financial research company said that because foreign investors are selling a lot of futures and there's uncertainty about the US-Taiwan tariffs, the Taiwan stock market will be unstable in the short term. They are watching if the market can stay above 22251 points.

On July 4th, the US stock market was closed for Independence Day. The Taiwan stock market dropped by 165.47 points and closed at 22547.5 points, but it stayed above 22529 points.

In company news, Hon Hai's sales in June were NT$540.237 billion, which is a bit less than May but 10.09% more than last year. For the first half of the year, their sales were NT$3.439 trillion, 19.68% more than last year. Both numbers are the highest ever for that period. Hon Hai expects sales to grow in the third quarter.

Largan, a company that makes camera lenses, had sales of NT$4.146 billion in June, up 29% from May and 3% from last year. For the first half of the year, their sales were NT$26.252 billion, up 18%. The company said their factories are full in the third quarter, and sales should increase each month, but the strong New Taiwan Dollar and tariffs could still cause problems.
