            <h1>Hsieh Po-hung Not Ordered to Pay in Affair Case, Court Rules</h1>
            <p>Hsieh Po-hung, who is a deputy secretary-general and head of the polling center for the Taiwan People's Party, was accused by his wife of having an affair with a university student named Wang. His wife sued them for money. A lower court decided they did not have to pay. His wife then appealed. The higher court said that Hsieh and Wang's relationship was not more than what is normal between friends. So, the court again ruled that Hsieh and Wang do not have to pay.</p>
            <p>According to the court documents from the Shilin District Court, Hsieh's wife said that in 2022, Hsieh Po-hung helped Gao Hung-an in her campaign for Hsinchu mayor and did not come home for several days. At that time, there were rumors that Hsieh Po-hung was dating another secretary, Ms. Lin. A reporter also said they saw Hsieh Po-hung and Ms. Lin kissing.</p>
            <p>Hsieh's wife checked the shared computer at home to find out the truth. She also found messages between Hsieh Po-hung and Ms. Wang, who was a junior student from his high school club, from April to November 2022. These messages were very suggestive.</p>
            <p>The court documents showed that in April 2022, Ms. Wang messaged Hsieh Po-hung saying, "Sleeping with a married man is not allowed, you could get sued." Hsieh replied, "It depends on the situation if I'll get sued." In June 2022, Ms. Wang messaged Hsieh Po-hung saying, "I'm not in danger, you are more in danger." Hsieh replied, "That's funny, what's dangerous?" and "You almost took me home, huh?" In November 2022, Hsieh Po-hung sent a message saying, "I'll book a hotel today, or will you mess up the dorm?"</p>
            <p>Hsieh's wife believed that Hsieh Po-hung and Ms. Wang were flirting online. She also said they went to a motel Hsieh Po-hung booked after drinking and stayed until the next day. She felt this hurt her rights as a wife and asked for NT$500,000 from Hsieh Po-hung and Ms. Wang. The Shilin District Court ruled against Hsieh's wife. She then appealed, and the Shilin District Court heard the second appeal.</p>
            <p>The Shilin District Court looked at the messages between Hsieh Po-hung and Ms. Wang. They said the messages were a bit lighthearted, but they were just friends joking about possibly doing something wrong after drinking. The court felt this did not go beyond what society usually accepts. Also, there was no proof that Hsieh Po-hung and Ms. Wang stayed overnight together in a hotel. So, the court kept its first decision, and this decision cannot be appealed again.</p>

            <h1>Seiji Ozawa's 90th Birthday: Christoph Eschenbach Conducts Mahler's "Resurrection"</h1>
            <p>September 1st is the 90th birthday of the Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa. This year, the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival has asked conductor Christoph Eschenbach to lead the Saito Kinen Orchestra for the first time. They will perform Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2, known as "Resurrection," to honor Seiji Ozawa.</p>
            <p>Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2, "Resurrection," was inspired by Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. Its final part includes singing and needs a very large group of musicians. Mahler used the poem "Resurrection" (Die Auferstehung) by the German poet Friedrich Klopstock for the words. The music takes listeners from darkness to light, offering a final salvation.</p>
            <p>Christoph Eschenbach, who is 85 years old this year, said he was very surprised when he heard about Seiji Ozawa's death. He added, "It is an honor for me to play a part in paying tribute to him by performing at the festival he started, on his birthday."</p>
            <p>According to news from the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival, Seiji Ozawa passed away in 2024 at the age of 88 because of illness. He was one of Japan's most famous conductors in the world. He was the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the United States for nearly 30 years and also led the Vienna State Opera.</p>
            <p>Eschenbach said that he and the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival discussed performing this piece together. He explained, "Resurrection is not something that doesn't exist. Rebirth is not only a religious idea but also a philosophical one."</p>
            <p>When Eschenbach spoke to Taiwanese media, he said it was his first time being invited to perform at the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival. He remembered, "In 1965, I won the Clara Haskil â€“ International Piano Competition in Lucerne. As part of the prize, I had the chance to work with Seiji Ozawa in the Netherlands. That performance was very inspiring for me as a young musician."</p>
            <p>Eschenbach stated that Seiji Ozawa gave him a lot of ideas and helped him understand his own musical thoughts better. He said, "You could say he influenced my music career." Later, Eschenbach worked with Seiji Ozawa on several Beethoven piano concertos. He mentioned, "Every time we worked together, it gave me great strength. Just being with him and watching how he interpreted music taught me a lot. That is why I immediately agreed when the festival invited me."</p>
            <p>The Saito Kinen Orchestra's Concert Program B, "Resurrection," will be performed on August 30th and 31st. The concerts will take place at the Kissei Bunka Hall in Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture, Japan.</p>

            <h1>UN Plans to Make Haiti Security Force Stronger, Experts Worried About Lack of Clear Plan</h1>
            <p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Aug. 29 (Foreign Media) â€“ The United Nations Security Council talked today about a plan for Haiti. The plan is to make the current international force that fights armed gangs stronger and bigger. But some experts on Haiti's security are worried that the plan is not clear enough.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that because of a long conflict, armed gangs now control almost all of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. This has made about 1.3 million people leave their homes, caused thousands of deaths, and led to severe hunger, like a famine.</p>
            <p>The plan, suggested by the United States and Panama, aims to change the current "Multinational Security Support Mission" into a new "Gang Suppression Force." The current mission does not have enough money or people.</p>
            <p>Like the current mission, which is led by Kenyan police, the new force will also get money from international donations. However, the way it is led will be different.</p>
            <p>A "permanent group" will lead the new force. This group will include countries that have sent people so far, along with the United States and Canada. A new UN office in Port-au-Prince will support it. The permanent group will choose a new commander for the force.</p>
            <p>The plan also asks the Organization of American States (OAS), a group of countries in the Americas, to keep its promise to provide specific help. This help includes food, communication tools, and protection gear.</p>
            <p>However, some experts in Haiti have criticized the plan. They say it doesn't clearly state where the money will come from. They also say it is too similar to existing structures and does not fix the main problems.</p>
            <p>Ricardo Germain, an independent security expert, said that besides money, he is especially worried about how the leadership will change. He pointed out that Kenya's difficult experience might make other countries not want to help.</p>
            <p>James Boyard, a security expert from the State University of Haiti, said that the new plan is too vague about how it will work with local forces. He also said that Haiti not being part of the permanent group harms Haiti's independence as a country.</p>
            <p>He also added that there must be a way to check if security staff do anything wrong, and this should be set up beforehand.</p>
            <p>Foreign countries helping in Haiti has always been a sensitive topic. In the past, UN missions in Haiti caused harm to regular people, including sexual assaults. There was also a cholera outbreak because of bad waste management, which killed over 9,000 people.</p>
            <p>Haiti's presidential office said it would comment once the official plan is announced. The US mission to the UN did not answer questions about this.</p>
