            <h1>TSMC Hits New High, Foxconn Surges, Taiwan Stock Market Sets Record</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 16 â€“ Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reached a new high price of 1490 NT dollars today. Foxconn (Hon Hai) also increased by more than 7%. The Taiwan stock market went up to 27673 points, gaining 397 points, setting a new record.</p>
            <p>Around 10:40 AM, the Taiwan Stock Exchange weighted index increased by 233.35 points, reaching 27509.06 points. The total value of shares traded was 333.039 billion NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Looking at the three big companies that have a lot of influence on the market: TSMC's price went up by 25 NT dollars to 1490 NT dollars. Foxconn's price rose by 16 NT dollars to 222.5 NT dollars, an increase of more than 7%. Delta Electronics, which started lower, then went up by 10 NT dollars to 1025 NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Some popular AI stocks took a break today and went down. These include companies that make cooling parts like Auras Technology, Dual Horn, and Kenmec. Also, some companies related to Battery Backup Units (BBU) like AES-KY, Shunda, and Gabay both fell during the trading day.</p>
            <p>Gao Haoxin, who is in charge of research at Fubon Asset Management, explained that AI stocks had grown a lot before. Recently, they have become more unstable because of bad news in the market, such as the trade war over rare earth metals between the US and China. However, the overall trend for the industry is still clear. It is expected that AI will still be the main focus of the market in the fourth quarter. The current small changes are due to specific events and do not change the positive outlook for AI stocks.</p>
            <p>Gao Haoxin said that the market is still focusing on AI-related areas. These include memory, Neocloud (new cloud companies), GPUs, fast data transfer, network communication, and AI parts. As US companies start reporting their third-quarter financial results, the performance of major technology companies will be very important for driving the stock market. People will pay close attention to how these companies perform.</p>

            <h1>US Strengthens Guam Defenses, Taiwan Minister Responds to China's Military Growth</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 16 â€“ Foreign news reported that the Pentagon is making its base in Guam much stronger. This is to stop China from using force against Taiwan and to be ready for any problems in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lin Chia-lung, said today that this is clearly a response to China's growing military power. Taiwan will work with other countries that share its ideas to keep the area peaceful.</p>
            <p>Guam is an island in the Pacific Ocean and part of the second island chain. It is becoming more important in the strategy between the US and China. The Wall Street Journal reported that China's missile abilities are getting better very quickly. The Pentagon is working hard to make its base in Guam stronger. This is to prevent China from attacking Taiwan and to deal with any conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan invited Minister Lin Chia-lung to talk about his work and answer questions.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting, Minister Lin told reporters that the US is sending more military to the Indo-Pacific area, especially to the island chain countries. He said this is definitely about China's growing military power. He believes this is true for other parts of the first island chain, not just the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Minister Lin also said that Taiwan will prepare well and work with friendly countries to keep the region peaceful and stable.</p>
            <p>In addition, reporters asked if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget for next year increased by over ten billion because this year's budget was cut too much. Minister Lin answered that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget share of the total national budget did not increase even though the total budget increased. He said the budget increase is to make Taiwan's diplomacy stronger, especially to carry out the "Rongbang Project" (a plan to improve relations with allied countries), to strengthen the role of the International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF), and to support international exchanges.</p>
            <p>People who know about the situation said that the foreign affairs budget for 2026 will be 1.37% of the total budget. This is more than 1.05% in 2025, but it is only back to the level of 2021. It is still less than the 1.73% it reached in 2009, when former President Ma Ying-jeou's government was in power. In comparison, China's foreign affairs budget has grown from 5.7 billion Chinese Yuan 25 years ago to 64.5 billion today, which is 11 times bigger.</p>
            <p>Reporters also asked if there were more plans for President Lai Ching-te to visit allied countries and stop over in the US, and if a meeting between leaders from China and the US (like a "Xi-Trump meeting") would affect these plans. Minister Lin said that visits by the President or other high-level officials are a key part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' work. If there are any new plans, the Presidential Office will announce them.</p>

            <h1>Belgium Expands Quiet Train Zones, France Creates Family and Business Areas</h1>
            <p>Paris, October 16 â€“ Taiwan High Speed Rail recently started "quiet carriages," which has caused a lot of discussion. In Belgium, a trial of "quiet zones" was successful, and they started to use them more widely last year. In France, travelers who want quiet can choose first-class or business seats. Parents with children can choose special family areas.</p>
            <p>This summer, someone posted on the social media site Reddit about buying a first-class ticket on a French high-speed train (TGV). Next to them was a family with two small children. The person who posted said they knew that young children can be noisy, and it's not their fault. However, the person had not slept well the night before and wanted to rest during the trip. So, they suggested that the French national railway company (SNCF) should create quiet carriages on TGV trains.</p>
            <p>There has been a lot of talk about this topic on social media. Some people wished for quiet carriage rules like those in Denmark or Italy. Some even suggested that children should not be allowed in first-class carriages.</p>
            <p>The Italian national railway company (Trenitalia) divides business and standard carriages into "Quiet Atmosphere" (Silenzio) and "Happy Atmosphere" (Allegro). When buying tickets, passengers who choose "Quiet Atmosphere" can rest or work quietly. Those who choose "Happy Atmosphere" can talk freely and move around. This is good for friends and families traveling together.</p>
            <p>The Belgian national railway company (SNCB) tried "quiet zones" on two busy routes for four months in 2023. In these areas, people could not talk, phones had to be silent, and if people listened to music, watched videos, or used social media, they had to wear headphones. Passengers who wanted to talk or make calls, or those worried their children might bother others, could choose other carriages.</p>
            <p>In September last year, the Belgian national railway company shared results from a survey. It showed that 90% of travelers who used the quiet zones were happy. Because of this, they decided to use quiet zones more widely. They will slowly add quiet zones to their main intercity trains, marking them with stickers or pictures. There is no extra cost for these zones.</p>
            <p>The Belgian national railway company said that in these areas, passengers should speak softly, keep their headphone volume low, and set their phones to silent.</p>
            <p>The French national railway company also tells people to be polite: don't disturb others, keep phones silent, and make calls in the spaces between carriages. Since these are not strict rules, if someone is noisy, train staff or other passengers often ask them to be quieter, but this doesn't always work.</p>
            <p>If passengers want to travel without being disturbed, they can choose first-class carriages, where there are fewer people. These tickets cost more, but the space is bigger, and there are even single seats. Passengers can also book seats in "Quiet Spaces" (Espace Calme) on some trains.</p>
            <p>Also, some routes have "First Class Business Zones" (Espace Business PremiÃ¨re). Passengers with these tickets can use VIP lounges at stations. Once on the train, they get free drinks and e-newspapers. Most passengers in these areas are business people, so the environment is usually quiet and better for working, reading, or resting.</p>
            <p>In regular TGV carriages, there are also "family spaces" (espace famille) that can be booked for families. In both first-class and regular carriages, there are also four-person seats facing each other that can be booked for families or small groups.</p>
            <p>Regarding the topic of quiet carriages, some social media users pointed out that while children might cry during a trip, adults using their phones loudly to watch TikTok videos or talking loudly on the phone are also disturbing. The problem is about good manners and respect, not just about children.</p>
