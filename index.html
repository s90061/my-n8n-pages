            <h1>Zelenskyy: Gaza Ceasefire Brings Hope for End of Russia-Ukraine War</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy praised the special ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. He said this makes him hope that Russia's war against Ukraine can end. He hopes leaders like former US President Trump can help make peace.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote on social media, "When peace happens somewhere in the world, it gives more hope for peace in other places."</p>
            <p>He added, "If there is a ceasefire and peace in the Middle East, then the leaders and strong will of people around the world can surely help us in Ukraine too."</p>
            <p>Russia started a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This led to the biggest war in Europe since the end of World War II. Russia has said no to ceasefires many times. They have set strict rules, basically asking Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to give up to get peace.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump once promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war within hours of becoming president. But even after many talks by the US, and meetings between Trump and Russian President Putin, there has not been much progress toward a peace deal for Russia and Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>High-Speed Rail Removes Quiet Car Signs to Avoid Misunderstanding, Rethinks Policy Promotion</h1>
            <p>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation said today that yesterday they took down the "Quiet Car" signs from the back of train seats. They replaced them with cards that say "Enjoy High Speed Rail, Travel Quietly Together." They will also think about new ways to share their policy.</p>
            <p>The "Quiet Car" rule started on September 22 and caused some debate. Some people wondered if the signs meant they could not make any noise at all. High Speed Rail said that they also took down the signs from food trolleys and stopped having staff hold up signs. Now, they only use electronic signs on trains, in stations, and on their official website to share the message.</p>
            <p>High Speed Rail said that making the train cars quieter is about stopping people from talking on the phone or using electronic devices without headphones, which bothers other passengers. For babies, young children, or people with illnesses that affect their ability to control themselves, staff will always be caring and give any help and comfort needed.</p>
            <p>High Speed Rail said they will continue to listen to and understand the opinions of families traveling together. They will also improve how their staff on the front lines carry out their duties to avoid misunderstandings. They will also work to give passengers the care and help they need.</p>

            <h1>Hualien County Government Asks for Evacuation Plan, Executive Yuan Says it's Local Responsibility</h1>
            <p>A barrier lake overflowed and caused serious damage in Guangfu Township, Hualien. Today, the Hualien County Government used the Disaster Prevention and Relief Act to ask the Executive Yuan to create and carry out a plan for disaster evacuation and shelter. The Executive Yuan replied that the Hualien County Government likely misunderstood the rules in the Act. They said that approving disaster prevention and relief plans for cities and counties is the responsibility of the city and county governments. Also, making or carrying out the plans is a local government job.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hualien County Government sent letters to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of the Interior. They quoted Article 35, Paragraph 2 of the Disaster Prevention and Relief Act, which states: "When special municipalities, counties, or cities cannot handle a disaster, the central government agency in charge of disaster prevention and relief should send staff to help. Or, if the special municipality, county, or city asks for it, they should send people to help coordinate."</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government said that the barrier lake still has a lot of mud and water. When a disaster happens, the number of deaths and injuries, and the area affected, are much more than what the local government can handle. So, they asked that when a yellow or red alert is issued and people need to be moved out safely, the Executive Yuan should send staff to set up a forward coordination office. This office should then manage and carry out the evacuation plan.</p>
            <p>In the evening, Lee Hui-chih, spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, replied. She said that approving local government disaster prevention and relief plans is, by law, the responsibility of local governments. She also said that the Hualien County Government's reason for asking the central government to approve an evacuation plan, based on Article 35 of the Disaster Prevention and Relief Act, probably shows a misunderstanding of the Act's rules.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih pointed out that according to Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the Disaster Prevention and Relief Act, approving city and county disaster prevention and relief plans is the responsibility of the city and county governments. Also, Article 24, Paragraph 1 of the Act clearly states that forced evacuation is a responsibility of the city and county governments. This means that both making and carrying out such plans are local government duties.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih explained that Article 35 of the Disaster Prevention and Relief Act means that when a township or city office cannot handle a disaster, the county government should send staff to help. When a county government cannot handle a disaster, then the central government agency in charge of disaster prevention and relief should send staff to help. But the official government body in charge does not change; it is still the city or county government.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih said that Ji Lian-cheng, the chief coordinator for the central forward coordination office for disaster recovery in Guangfu Township, had already called meetings on October 10, 11, and the morning of October 12 with different government departments. They discussed Hualien County's disaster evacuation and shelter plan. They looked at the plan's content very carefully and also invited the Hualien County Government and the Guangfu, Fenglin, and Wanrong Township offices to join. After the meeting on the morning of the 12th, they asked Rao Zhong, the acting secretary-general of the Hualien County Government, to take the discussion points back to the county government for further talks.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih said that even though the Hualien County Government has not yet given specific reasons why they "cannot handle" the situation, or officially asked for help as per the law, the central forward coordination office has always actively and fully provided the necessary help to the local area at different stages.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih stressed that natural disasters can be unpredictable, and all levels of government must be careful. The Executive Yuan will do its best to provide necessary help according to the law. Ji Lian-cheng has also called meetings with different government departments many times to give suggestions for Hualien County's disaster evacuation and shelter plan. All of this is for the people of Hualien. She hopes that the Hualien County Government can approve the related disaster prevention and relief plans according to its legal duties. This will give people clear instructions and help them know how to evacuate during a disaster. She hopes that local and central governments can work together to protect people's lives and property.</p>
