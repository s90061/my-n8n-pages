            <h1>China's September 3rd Military Parade: Experts Say False History Aims to Control World Order</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 1st (Central News Agency) â€“ The Chinese Asia-Pacific Elite Interchange Association held a meeting today. They discussed the possible actions and effects of China's "September 3rd Military Parade." Those at the meeting said that Beijing wants to strongly control the international world order. It uses the "September 3rd Military Parade" and wrong stories about the war against Japan to do this. They added that China's "one-China principle" is wrong and does not match Taiwan's situation. It has no real right or legal basis.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) this evening, MAC Deputy Minister Shen Yu-chung, who was at the meeting, said this year marks 80 years since World War II ended. He noted that the Axis powers from that time are now democratic countries. This shows that only freedom and democracy can help a country grow. Only respect for human dignity can earn respect. He also said that control and attacks only bring death, sadness, and more unfairness.</p>
            <p>He explained that in recent years, China has put different types of pressure on Taiwan and nearby countries. This includes military threats and small attacks. This has made the international world very unstable. China is increasing its military power, calling it "the great rebirth of the nation." This shows how new powerful governments threaten freedom and democracy. It is like the fascist military rule 80 years ago, which used nationalism to start attacks on other countries. Now, talking about remembering "anti-fascism" is a big joke.</p>
            <p>Shen Yu-chung stressed that China changes historical facts. It claims to have led the war against Japan and then holds events like "September 3rd" and "Taiwan's Retrocession." These events have no political, historical, or legal right. Historically, China did not do much in the war against Japan. It only used the war to become more powerful. Politically, after the war, countries valued stopping attacks, building democracy, and human rights.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that China's current actions, like supporting attackers and harming democracy and human rights, are known worldwide. Legally, China purposely promotes the "one-China principle" internationally. It wrongly connects this to UN Resolution 2758. It also makes legal mistakes with its idea of state succession. All these are attempts to create an "international one-China."</p>
            <p>Shen Yu-chung said that China uses the big military parade and wrong stories. It tries to trick the international community into accepting its claim over Taiwan. It wants to combine the political goals of "international one-China" (to make Taiwan unite and stop outside interference) and "cross-strait one-China" (to stop independence and encourage unity). This is to push its plan for "forced unification" with Taiwan later. Many democratic countries worldwide have already spoken against this, and the people of Taiwan will not agree with it.</p>
            <p>He also pointed out that China spends a lot of money on the military parade. It wants to show its military strength and increase its influence in the region and worldwide. It also stands with powerful countries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. It wants to create a world where it can stand against democratic countries like the US and Europe. At the same time, it hopes the "September 3rd Military Parade" will encourage nationalism. This would strengthen confidence inside China. It would also shift attention away from problems like competition with the US, a slowing economy, corruption in the military, and power struggles.</p>
            <p>The experts at the meeting also said that China's "September 3rd Military Parade" has a clear goal: to influence Taiwan. In May this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote an article in Russian media. He linked China's plans for Taiwan with the international order after World War II. He hopes to make China's claims over Taiwan seem right, using history and international law.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that China will not stop these actions after the "September 3rd Military Parade." It will continue to push them. China is not only trying to influence Taiwan and control the historical story. It is also purposely linking the "Shanghai Cooperation Organization" summit with the "September 3rd Military Parade." This is to make more foreign leaders attend the parade.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, experts also said that Beijing uses legal arguments, historical memories, and military ceremonies. It not only falsely claims to be the main force in the war against Japan. It also wants to make the "one-China" idea seem more politically right. It uses methods to influence people and control the historical narrative. The experts also stressed that nationalism and patriotism are two sides of the same coin. China continues to use nationalism to make Xi Jinping's power stronger.</p>
            <p>The MAC also stated that remembering the victory in the war against Japan is to show how important "peace" is. However, China repeatedly says it will not give up using force against Taiwan and continues to increase its power. This will affect peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The government is closely watching the situation. It also asks the people to work together and follow the government's policies for cross-strait relations. This is to protect the country's independence and respect.</p>
