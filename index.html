Last year, the United States saw a significant increase in wealth, adding over 379,000 new U.S. dollar millionaires. This number, which is more than 1,000 new millionaires per day, was higher than in any other market globally, according to a report published by UBS on Wednesday. North America, along with the U.S., contributed to more than half of the personal wealth across the 56 global markets examined in the report. UBS noted that in 2024, wealth growth was strongly directed towards North America, largely due to a stable U.S. dollar and positive financial markets. While the U.S. gained the most new millionaires, Switzerland and Luxembourg had the highest concentration of U.S.-dollar millionaires per person, with more than one in seven adults in these countries being a millionaire.

**Chinese Tugboat "Union Offshore 5001" Enters Taiwanese Waters Without Obstruction**

A large Chinese tugboat named "Union Offshore 5001," reportedly carrying an unknown load, openly entered Taiwan's territorial waters without any apparent interception by Taiwanese authorities. The Hengchun Coast Guard's PP3559 vessel reported being unable to receive signals from the ship, leading to no further action. Taiwan ADIZ (Air Defense Identification Zone) issued a warning, expressing concern about the unknown motives of "Union Offshore 5001." They suggested that if the tugboat were transporting large military weapons or engaging in "grey zone" intrusions, such as damaging Taiwan's undersea cables, strict monitoring and interception would be necessary. The incident highlights potential vulnerabilities in Taiwan's maritime security.
