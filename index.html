            <h1>Explosion at US Explosives Factory: Many Feared Dead and Missing</h1>
            <p>A factory in Tennessee, USA, that makes explosives had a deadly explosion today. Emergency teams quickly went to the place. Authorities told people to stay away from the area. Reports say that many people have died and others are missing.</p>
            <p>The sheriff's office in Hickman County, Tennessee, shared on Facebook, "We can confirm there was an explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems, an explosives factory in Bucksnort."</p>
            <p>The sheriff's office also said, "Emergency workers are now at the scene. Please avoid this area so that rescue workers can do their job."</p>
            <p>The Hickman County Mayor's office told AFP that they could not immediately confirm if anyone died or what caused the explosion.</p>
            <p>However, US media reported that Sheriff Chris Davis of Humphreys County said the explosion caused "several deaths" and that more people are missing.</p>
            <p>NBC News reported what Sheriff Davis said: "Several people are still not found. We are trying our best to support the families. We can confirm that some people have indeed lost their lives."</p>
            <p>Accurate Energetic Systems is a company that has made explosives since 1980. The company has not yet answered AFP's request for comments.</p>

            <h1>Switzerland Hopes to Sign New Trade Deal with China Early Next Year to Lower Taxes</h1>
            <p>After a meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said today that Switzerland hopes to sign a new free trade agreement with China by early 2026.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that China is Switzerland's third-largest trading partner, after the US and the European Union. The current trade agreement started in 2014. It has become more important to update this agreement, especially after the US put high taxes on Swiss products in August.</p>
            <p>After the meeting in Bellinzona, Cassis told reporters, "We are happy to see good progress in the talks to update the free trade agreement. Both sides want to finish this work quickly."</p>
            <p>He added, "We might not reach an agreement by the end of this year as we first hoped. But now we are aiming to create a more open, fair trade environment that follows international free trade rules by early next year."</p>
            <p>Even though China and Switzerland signed a free trade agreement in 2013, some Swiss products, like watches and medicines, still face high taxes in China. China also wants more investments from Switzerland. The old agreement did not include many rules for opening up service industries.</p>
            <p>In the past, talks to update the free trade agreement stopped because of worries about human rights in China.</p>
            <p>In recent years, Switzerland has continued to work with other trading partners to make its trade more spread out and find new markets for its exports.</p>
            <p>In July this year, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, signed a free trade agreement with countries in South America called MERCOSUR. This agreement covers 95% of Swiss exports. Last year, EFTA also signed a deal with India to lower taxes on products such as medicines, machines, watches, and optical instruments.</p>
