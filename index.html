            <h1>Heavy Rains Flood Farms in Taitung, Farmers Told to Quickly Harvest Vegetables</h1>
            <p>For many days, there has been heavy rain in Taitung. Some areas have received hundreds of millimeters of rain. Because of this, farmland is flooded, and the water is up to people's knees in many places. The Taitung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station is telling farmers to quickly pick any good vegetables while the rain has stopped today. They also need to drain the water from their fields quickly.</p>
            <p>The Taitung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, which is part of the Ministry of Agriculture, said today that a typhoon's outer winds caused strong rain from July 18 to 21. Taitung had over 300 millimeters of rain, and some towns had more than 500 millimeters. They are telling farmers to take steps to help their farms recover after the heavy rain. Farmers should quickly remove standing water, clean up broken branches and fallen fruit, and trim tree branches. They also need to control plant diseases to stop them from spreading.</p>
            <p>The Taitung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station gave advice for important crops. For fruit trees, if the orchards are flooded, farmers should drain the water right away. They also need to clean the orchards well. Farmers should focus on preventing diseases like anthracnose and fruit rot in custard apples. For citrus fruits and pomelos, farmers should watch out for and prevent bacterial canker disease after the strong winds and rain.</p>
            <p>For rice fields, if the field edges and water channels are damaged, they should be fixed right away so water can be managed properly. Farmers should also pay attention to announcements from the Agricultural and Rural Water Resources Agency. If the water entrance to the irrigation channel is broken, farmers should keep some water in the fields. This will help prepare the land for planting.</p>
            <p>For other crops like grains and special plants, farmers should quickly remove water from the fields. They can add some fertilizer to pigeon pea and roselle plants to help them grow. If plants have fallen over, farmers should not stand them up immediately. Instead, they can put soil around the base of the plant and trim any broken branches. For pigeon peas, they should prevent anthracnose and blight. For roselle, they should prevent blight. For vegetables, after heavy rain, farmers should work hard to remove water from the fields. They should quickly pick and sell any leaves or fruits that are still good to reduce losses from the disaster.</p>

            <h1>White House Bans Wall Street Journal from Trump's Trip After Story About Bad Letter</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 21, combined foreign reports) The White House today stopped The Wall Street Journal from going with President Trump on his trip to Scotland. This decision was made because the newspaper had reported that Trump sent a rude birthday letter to his old friend, Jeffrey Epstein, a rich man who committed sex crimes.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse said that Trump said the report was not true. On July 18, he sued The Wall Street Journal and the media boss Rupert Murdoch. Trump is asking for at least 10 billion US dollars (about 295.8 billion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>This ban on The Wall Street Journal is the second time Trump's government has stopped a big news company from joining a press trip because of what they reported. Since February, Trump's government has also stopped Associated Press reporters from going to important events many times.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, who is the White House Press Secretary, said: "As the appeals court has said, The Wall Street Journal or any other news company cannot be sure they will get special permission to go into the President's Oval Office, Air Force One, and the President's private places for interviews."</p>
            <p>Leavitt said: "The false reports and untrue statements from The Wall Street Journal mean it will not be on the list of 13 media companies that will travel with the President on Air Force One."</p>
            <p>This weekend, Trump will go to Scotland to meet with the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer. Trump owns two golf resorts there.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal had earlier found out that Ghislaine Maxwell, a rich British socialite, collected birthday cards that Epstein received for his 50th birthday in May 2003. Among them was a rude letter signed by Trump. It had some words typed on a machine, and outside the words, there was a thick outline of a naked woman, which looked like it was drawn by hand.</p>
