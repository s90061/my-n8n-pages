<b>Large Chinese Tugboat "Lianhe Haigong 5001" Enters Taiwan's Territorial Waters Without Interception</b>

A large Chinese tugboat, the 'Lianhe Haigong 5001,' was seen entering Taiwan's territorial waters while towing an unknown object. The Hengchun Coast Guard's PP3559 vessel reportedly lost the tugboat's signal and took no further action. The Taiwan ADIZ monitoring group issued a warning, stating that the 'Lianhe Haigong 5001s' intentions are unclear. They raised concerns that the tugboat could be involved in gray-zone tactics, such as damaging undersea cables or transporting large military equipment. The group emphasized the need for strict monitoring and interception procedures in such cases.
