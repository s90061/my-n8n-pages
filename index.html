"Quiet quitting," the act of doing the bare minimum required at work and disengaging from extra tasks, has become a trending topic. This doesn't mean employees are actually quitting their jobs. Instead, they're rejecting the idea of going above and beyond, prioritizing work-life balance. Many workers, especially younger generations, feel burned out and disillusioned by demanding work cultures.

Experts suggest quiet quitting stems from a lack of recognition, poor management, and unrealistic expectations. Employees who feel undervalued may withdraw their discretionary effort, focusing solely on their core responsibilities. This trend presents challenges for employers who need to create engaging and supportive workplaces to retain talent and maintain productivity. Companies may need to reassess workloads, provide more opportunities for growth, and foster a culture where employees feel appreciated. Ultimately, addressing the underlying issues that lead to quiet quitting is essential for a healthy and productive work environment.

**Article 2: Amsterdam to Introduce Tourism Tax Hike to Combat Over-Tourism**

Amsterdam is increasing its tourism tax to address the negative impacts of over-tourism. The city aims to reduce overcrowding and use the extra revenue to invest in local infrastructure and improve the quality of life for residents. The tourist tax for hotel stays will rise to 12.5% of the room rate, making it one of the highest in Europe.

Cruise ship passengers will also face a new tax, intended to discourage large vessels from docking in the city center. These measures are part of a broader strategy to manage tourism sustainably. Amsterdam hopes to attract visitors who are more respectful of the city and its inhabitants. The city also plans to promote alternative attractions and encourage tourists to explore less crowded areas. The increased revenue will fund projects such as improving public transportation and maintaining green spaces, benefitting both residents and visitors.

**Article 3: Innovative Vertical Farms Aim to Revolutionize Urban Agriculture**

Vertical farms, indoor facilities that grow crops in stacked layers, are gaining traction as a solution to food security challenges. These farms use controlled environments to optimize growing conditions, resulting in higher yields and reduced water consumption compared to traditional agriculture. They can be located in urban areas, shortening supply chains and providing fresh produce to local communities.

One of the major advantages of vertical farming is its ability to grow crops year-round, regardless of weather conditions. These farms also eliminate the need for pesticides and herbicides, producing healthier and more sustainable food. While the initial investment in vertical farms can be high, advancements in technology are making them more efficient and affordable. As cities continue to grow and face increasing pressure to feed their populations, vertical farming could play a crucial role in creating a more resilient and sustainable food system.
