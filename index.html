Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund is putting money into a company that's trying to make aviation more environmentally friendly. The Fund, which supports businesses working on solutions to climate change, is investing in Infinium, a startup that creates sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF is made from waste carbon dioxide and renewable hydrogen, meaning it has a much smaller carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel. This investment will help Infinium build a new production facility and scale up its SAF production. The goal is to provide airlines with a viable alternative to fossil fuels, helping the aviation industry reduce its impact on the environment. Amazon hopes that by supporting companies like Infinium, it can speed up the development and adoption of cleaner technologies and reach its own climate goals.

**The Rise of "Quiet Quitting" in the Workplace**

A new trend called "quiet quitting" is gaining popularity among workers. It doesn't mean actually quitting your job. Instead, it refers to doing only what your job description requires and nothing more. Employees who are quiet quitting are not necessarily unhappy or disengaged, but they are choosing to set boundaries and avoid burnout. They are no longer going above and beyond, working long hours, or taking on extra responsibilities without compensation. This trend is seen by some as a healthy response to the pressure of modern work culture, where employees are often expected to be constantly available and productive. Others worry that it could lead to lower productivity and a lack of innovation. The reasons behind this trend are complex, including a desire for better work-life balance, feeling undervalued, and a lack of opportunities for growth.

**Italy's Floating City, Venice, to Introduce Tourist Fee**

Venice, the famous Italian city known for its canals and bridges, is planning to introduce a fee for tourists visiting for just one day. The aim is to manage the huge crowds that often overwhelm the city, particularly during peak seasons. The fee, which will range from â‚¬3 to â‚¬8 depending on the time of year and the number of visitors, will be charged to day-trippers. Tourists who stay overnight in hotels are already subject to a tourist tax and will not have to pay the new fee. The money collected will be used to improve services for residents and visitors, such as waste management, public transport, and cultural events. City officials hope that the fee will discourage some day-trippers from visiting during the busiest times, helping to preserve the city's unique character and make it more enjoyable for everyone.
