            <h1>Standard Chartered forms alliance, launches offshore private credit strategy product</h1>
            <p>Standard Chartered Bank announced today that it will work with Prudential Life, First Gold Securities Investment Trust, and Brookfield Oaktree Wealth Solutions. Together, they will offer the first "offshore private credit strategy product" on an international banking trust platform. This is part of Taiwan's goal to become an important center for asset management in Asia.</p>
            <p>Standard Chartered Bank held a press conference today. Samir Subberwal, the global head of wealth solutions, deposits, and mortgages for Standard Chartered Group, came to Taiwan. This shows how much Standard Chartered values the Taiwanese market.</p>
            <p>Samir Subberwal said that Standard Chartered Bank is slowly building its wealth management business for rich customers in Taiwan. In July this year, it became the first bank to join the Kaohsiung special zone for asset management in Asia. In August, it teamed up with Prudential Life to be the first foreign bank to offer "premium financing" services. This new way of working together in finance shows that the bank believes in the continued growth of wealth management around the world.</p>
            <p>Subberwal also mentioned that Standard Chartered has connections in over 50 markets globally and four wealth centers. With its strong local presence, it offers many kinds of wealth management services for rich clients. The bank aims to grow its wealth management business by more than 10% in five years, and Taiwan has great potential for this growth.</p>
            <p>Samrat Khosla, the head of wealth management at Standard Chartered Bank, said that rich clients want more complete and varied investment plans. They also want expert financial advice and wish to expand their financial views through global investments. Standard Chartered Bank will continue to make its wealth management services better and work with partners. This will help them offer clients financial services that are in line with international standards.</p>
            <p>Standard Chartered Bank stated that in addition to working closely with Prudential Life, it will also work with First Gold Securities Investment Trust and Brookfield Oaktree Wealth Solutions. They will introduce the first "offshore private credit strategy product" on an international banking trust platform for rich clients in the Kaohsiung asset zone. This product invests in things that are not traditional stocks, bonds, or cash, such as private credit, private equity, and real assets. This helps rich clients reduce the overall risk in their investments, aiming to spread risk, increase chances for profit, and protect against inflation.</p>

            <h1>Sri Lanka's Parliament asks 3 former presidents to leave state-owned houses</h1>
            <p>The Parliament in Sri Lanka voted today to ask former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and two other past leaders to leave houses owned by the government. This is a new rule by the left-wing government, which wants to spend less money.</p>
            <p>The political party led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake voted to approve a new law. This law cancels an older law from 1986. The old law allowed former leaders to have fancy houses and special assistants.</p>
            <p>Only one lawmaker from the opposition voted against the new law. It passed with a lot of votes, 150 out of 225.</p>
            <p>Harshana Nanayakkara, the Justice Minister, told the Parliament, "We are stopping the 1986 law to save money for taxpayers." He said that the former leaders used their power to give themselves expensive government houses.</p>
            <p>However, an opposition lawmaker, Dayasiri Jayasekara, said the government was being mean. He said they were acting against their political rivals. "You brought this law because you could not make President Rajapaksa move out by threatening him. Now you are acting out of hate," he said.</p>
            <p>This law was passed just one day after the Supreme Court decided that taking away these special benefits from former leaders was not against the country's main laws.</p>
            <p>Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not want to leave a luxury house in the capital earlier this year. The government asked him many times, but he ignored them.</p>
            <p>The other two former presidents, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Maithripala Sirisena, are living in government houses in Colombo, where foreign embassies are located. They have not said anything about this yet.</p>

            <h1>13 financial companies' August profit of NT$57.8 billion, a jump of over 70% from last year</h1>
            <p>In August, thirteen financial companies in Taiwan made a total profit of NT$57.832 billion after taxes. This is a big increase of 78.54% compared to August last year. This happened because the New Taiwan dollar became weaker against the US dollar by more than 2%, and the stock market did very well.</p>
            <p>From January to August this year, these thirteen financial companies earned NT$363.829 billion. Fubon Financial Holdings earned the most profit in August, and also the most profit and highest earnings per share (EPS) for the first eight months. But overall, only five companies made more profit in the first eight months this year than last year. These were Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings, E.SUN Financial Holding Co., E.SUN Financial Holding Co., First Financial Holding Co., and Hua Nan Financial Holdings. Most of these companies focus mainly on banking.</p>
            <p>Fubon Financial Holdings reported a profit of NT$11.1 billion after taxes in August. For the first eight months, their profit was NT$73.48 billion, and their EPS was NT$5.11. Fubon said that Fubon Life Insurance made NT$5.81 billion in August. Taipei Fubon Bank made NT$3.26 billion after taxes in August, and NT$25.74 billion for the first eight months. Its core business was strong, and its profit in August was 12% higher than last year, which is the highest for August ever. Fubon Insurance's profit for the first eight months grew by 32% compared to last year. Fubon Securities' profit for the first eight months was the second highest ever for that period.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holdings made NT$10.27 billion after taxes in August. For the first eight months, its profit was NT$65.05 billion, and its EPS was NT$4.18. Cathay said that Cathay Life Insurance made NT$5.33 billion after taxes in August. Cathay United Bank made NT$3.69 billion in August and NT$31.28 billion for the first eight months. It did well because loans grew and costs for money were managed well, so its net interest income grew by more than 10%. Overall, Cathay United Bank, Cathay Century Insurance, and Cathay Securities Investment Trust all set new profit records for the first eight months. Cathay Securities had its second-highest profit for the same period.</p>
            <p>CTBC Financial Holdings earned NT$7.901 billion after taxes in August. For the first eight months, its total profit after taxes was NT$49.581 billion, and its EPS was NT$2.49. CTBC said its subsidiary, CTBC Bank, did well in August with loans, deposits, and wealth management, making NT$4.995 billion. Its other subsidiary, Taiwan Life Insurance, made NT$2.382 billion in August.</p>
            <p>Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings' August profit includes its original Taishin Financial Holdings profit and the profit from Shin Kong after they joined. The company announced a total profit of NT$4.7 billion after taxes for August. For the first eight months, their profit was NT$18.54 billion, and their EPS was NT$1.13. Taishin Bank made NT$2.01 billion in August, which is the second-highest ever for the month.

            <p>For the four big state-owned financial holding companies: Mega Financial Holdings' profit after taxes for the first eight months was NT$25.465 billion, which is 5.4% less than last year, but its EPS was NT$1.72, still the highest among state-owned companies. First Financial Holding Co.'s profit after taxes for the first eight months was NT$19.655 billion, an increase of 3.6%. Hua Nan Financial Holdings' profit after taxes for the first eight months was NT$17.253 billion, an increase of 6.07%.
