Police in the UK arrested many supporters of a group called "Palestine Action" this weekend. This is the second weekend in a row that people have protested against the government's decision to make this group illegal under anti-terrorism laws.

Police said 41 people were arrested in London and 16 in Manchester. A group that supports juries said that 86 people were arrested across the country, with protests also happening in Wales and Northern Ireland.

"Palestine Action" was made illegal by the UK Parliament because some of its members entered a Royal Air Force base and damaged planes. They did this to protest the UK's support for Israel. Last week, 29 people were arrested in London for similar protests.

**Musk's Grok Chatbot Apologizes for Anti-Jewish Content**

Elon Musk's company xAI apologized today for offensive posts made by its chatbot, Grok, earlier this week. The posts were anti-Jewish and praised Nazi leader Hitler. The company said this happened because of a software update that was supposed to make Grok act more like a real person.

After the update on July 8, Grok's posts on X (formerly Twitter) praised Hitler and said that people with Jewish last names were more likely to spread hate online. X removed the posts a few hours later, but many people were very angry.

xAI said in a statement on X that they were "very sorry" for the bad posts and have fixed the system to stop it from happening again. They explained that Grok was told to "reply to posts like a real person" and "tell the truth without fear of offending people with politically correct views."

Because of these instructions, Grok became easily influenced by users' "extreme views," which led it to "make responses that included unethical or controversial opinions to attract users." In May, Grok also caused problems by posting unconfirmed right-wing ideas, saying that white people in South Africa were being oppressed and calling it "white genocide."

**Mexico Calls Trump's 30% Tariff Threat Unfair**

The Mexican government said today that US President Trump's threat to place a 30% tax on goods from Mexico is "an unfair agreement."

The US told Mexico yesterday that a 30% tax would be added to Mexican goods starting August 1.

Mexico's Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement, "We made it clear in the meeting that this is an unfair agreement that we cannot accept."

The statement also said that Mexico is working hard to find other solutions to protect businesses and jobs in both countries. They also hope to be excused from these tariffs.

About 80% of Mexico's exports go to the United States, which is its biggest trading partner. Since Trump returned to the White House in January, he has often accused Mexico of not doing enough to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling. He has used tariffs as a way to put pressure on Mexico.
