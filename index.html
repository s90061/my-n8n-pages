            <h1>US Scholars Analyze Trump-Putin Meeting: No Progress on Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire, US Should Increase Pressure</h1>
            <p>The meeting between the US and Russia ended today. US President Trump said they agreed on many things but did not make a final deal. An American expert said the meeting did not help stop the war between Russia and Ukraine much. However, Russia did manage to delay new punishments. The expert thinks the US should change its plan and put more pressure on Russia by giving more help to Ukraine's military or by adding more punishments.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for almost 3 and a half years. Today, President Trump and Russian President Putin met in Alaska to talk about a ceasefire. This was the first time the current leaders of the US and Russia met since 2021. After the meeting, Trump and Putin had a press conference together. Trump said they found common ground on many issues but did not reach an agreement.</p>
            <p>Daniel Kochis, a senior researcher at the Hudson Institute, a US think tank, spoke about the meeting. He said his first thought was, "This is a bit disappointing." He felt they were "no closer to ending the Russia-Ukraine war" than before the meeting. The two leaders did not share many details about what they agreed on. He thought things were "mostly still the same as before the Alaska meeting."</p>
            <p>Kochis said this meeting was like Trump's past phone calls with Putin. "They talked around in circles but never really reached a ceasefire." He thought maybe they agreed on things that are not public yet. But he believed if they had, they would have talked about them in the press conference.</p>
            <p>He said the question now is, what happens next? Will there be new meetings? Will the US use stronger punishments to make Russia stop fighting? "These will be important questions in the next few days and weeks."</p>
            <p>Kochis observed that the meeting helped Putin delay some US punishments. At the same time, Trump really wanted to find a way to end the war. For Trump, this was a chance worth taking.</p>
            <p>Kochis pointed out that if the US and Russia meet but still cannot agree on a ceasefire, the US must try something different. This includes giving more military weapons to Ukraine or using more punishments to make Russia change its actions.</p>
            <p>He said directly that Putin has not yet achieved his goals. Putin does not feel he needs to end the war and thinks time is on his side. The US and European countries must change their plans to make Putin agree to stop fighting or give up.</p>
            <p>Trump and Putin met at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, which is the biggest military base in the state. After they arrived, Trump greeted Putin, and they walked on a red carpet and took pictures. Then they rode together in Trump's presidential car to the meeting place.</p>
            <p>Kochis said that Trump letting a leader like Putin ride in his car was not the best image. But Trump saw it as a way to start talks that he thought could lead to better results.</p>
            <p>He noticed that Trump seemed excited at first, hoping the meeting would make real progress. But his body language at the press conference clearly changed. Also, there was no time for questions, and a planned lunch and another meeting were canceled. All these signs show that they did not really agree on anything.</p>
            <p>Also, Putin said at the press conference that if Trump had been the US President, the Russia-Ukraine war would not have happened. This matched what Trump has always said. Kochis thinks Putin tried to use flattery to improve the situation and keep their relationship good for future talks. For Putin, it was important to "keep talking, and the punishments never happened."</p>

            <h1>PX Pay's June Payment Collection Exceeds NT$5.5 Billion, Close Behind Leader Jiekou Payment</h1>
            <p>The company that owns Jiekou Payment, Jiekou Financial Technology, had a problem in July. There was a disagreement about buying shares with another company called Tai Shan. Also, a court tried to take their property. According to new numbers from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) for June, PX Pay collected more than 5.535 billion New Taiwan Dollars in payments that month. This amount is very close to Jiekou Payment's 5.903 billion New Taiwan Dollars. The difference between them is only 368 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The FSC found that by the end of July this year, the total number of e-payment users reached 25,283,331 people. This was a 1.74% increase from the previous month. Jiekou Payment had the most users, with 6,214,600. Next was iPASS Corporation with 5,852,000 users. These two big e-payment companies together have almost half of all users.</p>
            <p>In July, Jiekou Financial Technology, the company that owns Jiekou Payment, had a fight over share buying with Tai Shan Enterprise. A court said they had to pay back 3.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars and ordered a temporary seizure of assets. The Taipei District Court tried to seize Jiekou Financial Technology's property but could not. This briefly made people lose trust in Jiekou Payment, which is a part of Jiekou Financial Technology. But then the FSC said that the money was safe, and businesses started using it again.</p>
            <p>Based on the FSC's latest numbers for June, by the end of June this year, the total number of e-payment accounts in Taiwan reached 33,132,836. This was an increase of 504,914 accounts, or 1.55%, compared to May.</p>
            <p>Now, in the e-payment market, there are 9 companies that only do e-payment business. These are PXPay, All Pay, EasyCard, iPASS Corporation, iCash, Gamania Pay, Jiekou Electronic Payment, Opay, and Simple Pay. There are also 20 other companies that do e-payment as part of their business. These include Chunghwa Post and 19 banks.</p>
            <p>For the number of users, iPASS Corporation has the most users right now. By the end of June this year, they had 6,980,900 users. Jiekou Electronic Payment was close behind with 6,929,000 users. PX Pay was third with 6,214,600 users. These three companies together have more than 60% of all e-payment users.</p>
            <p>In June, for money collected from real transactions, Jiekou Payment was first with 5.903 billion New Taiwan Dollars. PX Pay was close behind with 5.535 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Also, compared to May's numbers, Jiekou Payment's collected money went down a little by 5.13%. But PX Pay's collected money grew by 1.36%. People are now watching to see if the problems Jiekou Financial Technology had in July will change the e-payment market.</p>

            <h1>8/23 Referendum Approaches, Legislators to Inspect Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant on 20th</h1>
            <p>The vote to restart the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant will happen on August 23. On August 20, the Education and Culture Committee of the Legislative Yuan will visit the plant. Legislator Ge Ru-jun, who is leading the visit for the KMT party, said today that they will check how many workers are at the plant. They want to make sure the plant can be run safely. As elected representatives, they need to go and see the situation.</p>
            <p>There is only one week left until the August 23 vote to restart the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant and the vote to remove seven KMT legislators. On August 17, the Taiwan People's Party will join with more than 100 people from industries and schools, like Pegatron Chairman T.H. Tung, to support keeping the Ma-anshan plant running. On the evening of August 22, they will have a big event in Taipei before the vote. The KMT will also hold talks about the vote on August 17, 19, and 21 in Yunlin, Taipei, and Kaohsiung. They hope to encourage people to vote yes.</p>
            <p>Before the August 23 vote, Legislator Ge Ru-jun of the KMT, who will lead the Education and Culture Committee next week, also planned a trip to Hengchun Township in Pingtung County on August 20. They will check how ready the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant is to start working again.</p>
            <p>According to the plan for the visit, legislators from different parties will leave Taipei by high-speed rail at 7:30 AM on August 20. Their first stop will be the Taipower Southern Exhibition Hall in Hengchun Township, Pingtung County. There, they will get information about the current state of the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant's units and staff. They will also hear a safety briefing before going to the plant to look around. After that, they will have a general discussion. They plan to go back to Taipei around 3:00 PM.</p>
            <p>Ge Ru-jun said in an interview that what they will look at at the plant is still being planned. Even though the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant is not running now, there is still a lot of maintenance work. He does not want to bother the workers too much.</p>
            <p>Ge Ru-jun pointed out that the main goal of this visit is to see how many workers are currently at the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant. He wants to know if many nuclear engineering experts have left since the plant stopped running in May. Nuclear engineering experts are in high demand around the world now, as many countries like the US are promoting nuclear energy. If these experts leave, they will be gone.</p>
            <p>Ge Ru-jun said that legislators are not experts in nuclear energy. They cannot judge if the nuclear power plant's facilities are safe. But they can go to the site to confirm if the conditions for nuclear safety are there.</p>
            <p>He said that the opposition party is pushing for the vote to restart the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant. As elected representatives, they must go to the site to understand the situation. However, this is just a normal visit by the Legislative Yuan, and legislators are not the ones who will decide if the plant should restart. He hopes others will not see it as too political.</p>
