The Ministry of Transportation and Communications Civil Aeronautics Administration announced today that some airport flights might be affected from July 9 to 18 due to the Han Kuang 41 exercise. They ask passengers to check for updates to reduce any problems the exercise might cause.

The Ministry of National Defense said earlier that the "Han Kuang 41" exercise will be a 10-day, 9-night live drill from July 9 to 18, which is longer than the usual 5 days and 4 nights.

The Civil Aeronautics Administration said today that airports that might be affected include Taichung Airport on July 9, 13-15; Taoyuan Airport on July 13-17; Kaohsiung Airport on July 13, 16; Songshan Airport on July 13, 16; Tainan Airport on July 13, 14, 16; Hualien Airport on July 15, 16; and Chiayi Airport on July 16. The actual impact on flights will depend on the military's activities and air traffic conditions.

The Civil Aeronautics Administration reminds passengers to check their flight information before traveling to get the latest updates. Air traffic control will manage air traffic as needed during the exercise, so flights might take off earlier or later. Some flights might also be delayed after the exercise.

The Civil Aeronautics Administration said that information about the exercise airspace has been given to airlines and other relevant groups. Airlines are asked to inform passengers about flight changes through messages or their websites. Airports will also provide real-time flight information on screens, through announcements, or on their websites for passengers to check.

**Hermes-Epitek's June Revenue Reaches Over NT$500 Million for the First Time, Driven by Growth in Taiwan and Japan Labs**

Hermes-Epitek, a company that tests semiconductors, announced that its revenue for June was NT$503 million. This is a new record high, an increase of 17.22% from May and 15.7% from last year. Hermes-Epitek said that the growth in demand from its Taiwan labs and continued growth in its Japan labs were the main reasons for this record-high revenue in June.

Hermes-Epitek's revenue for the second quarter was NT$1.374 billion, which is also a new quarterly record, an increase of 10.92% from the first quarter. For the first six months of the year, the total revenue was NT$2.612 billion, up 5.56% from the same period last year.

Hermes-Epitek explained that as semiconductor factories move to 2-nanometer technology and change from FinFET transistors to GAAFET, things become more complex. This makes it harder to improve quality and analyze problems. Also, packaging designs are getting more complex, which will increase the need for testing services.

Additionally, burn-in testing is becoming a standard test for high-speed chips. Companies like AMD and Amazon are already using burn-in testing for new projects. Hermes-Epitek expects that this part of their business will start to contribute to revenue from the fourth quarter of this year.

Hermes-Epitek stated that the company has become a key provider for advanced semiconductor testing. They expect that the demand for testing AI chips (ASIC) and outsourced advanced process testing will keep growing. This should help their revenue and profits.

**After Typhoon, Heavy Rains Cause 48 Flooded Areas in Changhua County**

The Central Emergency Operation Center announced today that Typhoon Danas brought heavy rains, causing flooding in central and southern Taiwan. Currently, there are still 48 flooded areas in Changhua County and 3 in Yunlin County, and efforts are underway to address them. The Ministry of National Defense has been asked to prepare troops to help with recovery efforts in the affected areas.

The Central Emergency Operation Center held its 11th meeting this afternoon, led by Vice Commander Jian Wan-yao, who is also the Deputy Director of the National Fire Agency.

The disaster monitoring and search and rescue team reported that there are 7638 disaster reports nationwide. Tainan City has the most with 3935 reports, followed by Chiayi City with 1596, and Chiayi County with 796.

Regarding casualties, there were 2 deaths in Tainan City and 681 injuries. Tainan City had the most injured people with 270, followed by Chiayi City with 169, and Chiayi County with 148.

Because the typhoon heavily damaged the Chiayi-Tainan area, the Ministry of Interior's National Land Management Agency said that Chiayi County, Chiayi City, and Tainan City have asked for help with recovery. Central government agencies and 9 counties and cities are actively providing assistance.

The water and electricity supply group mentioned that today, heavy rains caused new flooding in Taichung City, Changhua County, and Yunlin County, totaling 62 incidents. Of these, 51 areas are still flooded, with 48 in Changhua County and 3 in Yunlin County.

Additionally, over 830,000 households nationwide experienced power outages. As of now, 110,970 households are still without power (87.19% have been restored). The areas still without power are Nantou, Chiayi, Yunlin, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, and power is expected to be fully restored by 11 PM tonight. Landline phone services were interrupted for 12,278 households, with 1991 still needing repair. 1378 base stations were damaged, and 490 are still being fixed.

The agriculture, forestry, and fisheries group reported that agricultural losses total about NT$1.096 billion. Chiayi County suffered the most with NT$522.12 million (48% of the total), followed by Tainan City with NT$281.6 million (26%), Yunlin County with NT$263.39 million (24%), and Pingtung County with NT$11.49 million (1%).

Also, pomelo suffered the most damage among crops, with losses of NT$138.87 million, followed by bananas, bamboo shoots, oranges, and ponkan tangerines.

Regarding vegetable prices, the Taipei fruit and vegetable market was closed yesterday. Today, when it opened, trading volume increased. Because sellers still had enough stock and the quality of vegetables arriving after the typhoon was mixed, prices fell. The Xiluo fruit and vegetable market saw reduced supply from farms after the rain and poor quality products, leading to lower prices today.

The transportation and engineering group mentioned that for tourism, all passengers in Penghu have been rebooked on flights, and no one is stranded. About 994 passengers are stranded in Matsu, and sea and air transport is working to get them out. In Xiaoliuqiu, since the Dongliu line resumed service today, no tourists are stranded. 536 passengers are stranded in Green Island and 78 in Orchid Island, but regular boat services today should clear them.

For evacuations, as of 2 PM, 11 counties and cities had carried out evacuations, with a total of 3769 people evacuated. For shelters, Tainan City still has 10 shelters open, housing 65 people.

Regarding post-disaster recovery, the Ministry of Environment said it is overseeing local environmental protection bureaus' cleanup operations. Statistics show that 565 environmental cleaning workers and 83 cleaning vehicles were used, removing 51.2 metric tons of mud and 44.945 metric tons of general waste (including garbage).

Finally, Jian Wan-yao instructed relevant units to pay attention to ongoing disaster management in central and southern Taiwan. As Premier Cho Jung-tai visited the affected areas today, some county and city leaders requested military assistance. The Ministry of National Defense has been asked to assess and provide support.
