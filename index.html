The weather bureau also warns people to be careful of lightning and strong winds. In mountain areas, there is a risk of landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides. In low-lying areas, people should be careful of flooding.

**US Announces New Tariffs: Malaysia 25%, South Africa 30%, Laos 40%**

US President Trump announced new tariffs today. Imports from Japan and South Korea will have a 25% tax. Malaysia and Kazakhstan will also face a 25% tax. South Africa will have a 30% tax. Laos and Myanmar will have the highest taxes at 40%. All these new taxes will start on August 1st.

In April, Trump said he would put a 10% tax on most imported goods and even higher "Liberation Day" taxes on many countries. But then he paused this plan to allow time for talks.

Trump sent letters to these countries through his social media, "Truth Social." The letters were mostly the same, but the tax rates were different. For example, Malaysia's tax went up to 25% from 24%. Kazakhstan's tax went down to 25% from 27%. South Africa's tax stayed at 30%. Laos's tax went down to 40% from 48%, and Myanmar's went down to 40% from 44%.

Trump told these countries that if they build factories or make products in the US, they will not have to pay these taxes. He said the US would quickly approve such investments, possibly in a few weeks. He also warned that if these countries raise their own taxes on US goods, the US will add the same percentage to their tariffs.

Trump explained that these taxes are needed to fix many years of unfair trade rules and barriers from these countries. These problems have caused the US to have too many trade deficits, which hurt the US economy and national safety.

Trump also left room for changes, saying the taxes "may be increased or decreased depending on our relationship with your country." The US has only finished trade talks with the UK, China, and Vietnam. Cambodia also said it reached a deal with the US. As the time limit for high tariffs is ending, Trump will sign an order today to move the July 9th deadline to August 1st.
