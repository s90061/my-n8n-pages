<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia has reportedly secured all the production capacity at Wistron's newly opened server facility in Taiwan until 2026. This move is to meet the high demand for AI servers.

The facility in Zhubei, Taiwan, will be used to produce Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. These orders, which run through 2026, show Nvidia's strong effort to get enough AI infrastructure capacity because demand is much higher than what is available.

The plant started operating this quarter and officially opened on June 19. Wistron's CEO confirmed at the event that contracts for AI server production are already set for at least a year. According to *Economic Daily* and *Commercial Times*, Nvidia has effectively reserved all future output from this plant.

Wistron's total operations are expected to produce about 240,000 Blackwell-based systems every three months. The company has warned that its current capacity might not be enough to meet future demand by 2026. To fix this, Wistron has secured a nearby building to become a second AI server site next year, aiming to double its production in Taiwan.

AI server shipments are a main driver of growth not only for Wistron but also for other companies like Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is also expanding its presence in the U.S. with a new facility near Dallas, Texas.

By booking full production at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia is making sure that its cloud and system partners get the necessary AI servers, while competitors might face tighter supply limits. Nvidia's control over the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity shows its plan to lead the AI hardware industry.

**China says Taiwan president spreading 'heresy' with sovereignty speech**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy", hostility and provocation, after a speech in which he said the island is "of course" a country and there is historical evidence and legal proof to back this up.

Beijing says democratically governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly reject that view, and have offered talks with China multiple times but have been rejected. China calls Lai a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had intentionally distorted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that blatantly incited cross-strait confrontation, and a hodgepodge of 'Taiwan independence' fallacies and heresies full of errors and omissions," it said in a statement.

"The fallacies fabricated by Lai Ching-te in contravention of history, reality and jurisprudence will only be swept into the rubbish heap of history."

Responding, Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said Lai was simply stating historical facts and Beijing's belief the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis".

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to face up to the fact that the Republic of China objectively exists and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.

Lai has repeatedly said that only Taiwan's people can decide their future, and that, as the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Taiwan has over the past five years faced stepped-up military and political pressure from China, including war games.
