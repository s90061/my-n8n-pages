            <h1>KPMG Survey: Global Venture Capital in Q2 Focuses on New Areas; AI Still Popular</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 7 (CNA) â€“ KPMG Anhou Jianyue announced today that in the second quarter of 2025, the venture capital market still showed strong activity. This happened despite big global economic and political problems. Important areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI), defense, and aerospace technology continued to attract investments. This shows that investors are very hopeful about future technologies and have smart plans.</p>
            <p>Today, KPMG Anhou Jianyue released their "Q2 2025 Venture Pulse: Global Venture Capital Analysis." This report talks about the chances, problems, and investment trends for new companies in the world and in major regions.</p>
            <p>Huang Haining, a senior accountant at KPMG Anhou Jianyue's Innovation and Startup Services team, said that the global venture capital market faced big challenges in the second quarter of 2025. Especially, the "Liberation Day" tariff policy announced by the U.S. on April 2 had a clear negative effect on global trade and supply chains. However, venture capital firms were clever. They focused more on new areas that could grow a lot and were less affected by trade risks.</p>
            <p>The report shows that in the second quarter of 2025, there were 7,356 venture capital deals, raising 101 billion U.S. dollars. This is less than the 128.4 billion U.S. dollars raised in the first quarter of 2025. The main reason for this difference is a very large deal of 40 billion U.S. dollars by OpenAI in the first quarter. If we don't count that one special deal, the venture capital activity in the second quarter was still quite strong. This shows that investors are still very interested in Artificial Intelligence, defense technology, and aerospace technology.</p>
            <p>KPMG pointed out that the Americas had strong venture capital activity in the second quarter, raising 72.7 billion U.S. dollars and completing 3,425 deals. Investment continued to be strong, especially in Artificial Intelligence, defense technology, and aerospace technology. The United States made up 70 billion U.S. dollars of the total investment in the Americas, which is almost 70% of the total global venture capital.</p>
            <p>KPMG gave examples of how Artificial Intelligence continues to drive global venture capital. The United States got some of the biggest deals in this area. These included Scale AI, an AI startup, which raised 14.3 billion U.S. dollars; Anduril Industries, an AI defense technology startup, which raised 2.5 billion U.S. dollars; Safe Superintelligence, an AI development startup, which raised 2 billion U.S. dollars; Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup, which raised 2 billion U.S. dollars in a first-round investment; and Anysphere, a Cursor programming assistant startup, which raised 900 million U.S. dollars.</p>
            <p>For other regions, KPMG said that in Europe, the 1,733 deals and 14.6 billion U.S. dollars in the second quarter of 2025 were a small decrease from the 2,358 deals and 16.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter. Asia is still at a low point. In the second quarter, there were 2,022 deals and 12.8 billion U.S. dollars. This is about a 24% drop in the number of deals compared to the first quarter, but the total investment increased slightly by 1.59%. The main reason for this is that China's economy has slowed down, causing Chinese venture capital investment to be the lowest in 10 years.</p>
            <p>KPMG thinks that in the third quarter of 2025, the total amount of global venture capital investment will likely remain low. This is mainly because of the uncertain U.S. tariff policy, which will make venture capitalists stay careful and wait. Artificial Intelligence is still expected to be a popular area for venture capital. More and more specific solutions will be chosen. Defense technology, medical technology, and financial technology will also get steady investments. However, venture capitalists might be more careful about industries that are easily affected by changes in U.S. tariff policy. They will wait until these policies are stable before making more investment plans.</p>
            <p>KPMG added that based on recent trends, making fund lives longer became an important trend for venture capital funds in the second quarter of 2025. Because of global uncertainty and a lack of easy money, this helps investors avoid selling their investments at a bad time. It also gives new companies more time to grow.</p>
            <p>KPMG stated that venture capitalists also want to be more involved in how their invested companies operate. They are changing from just investing to actually helping companies find changes and improve their value. This trend is especially important for old funds. Making funds last longer makes investors feel safer.</p>

            <h1>Trump Hopes TSMC Will Invest More; Liu Jing-ching Says Key Technology Will Be Protected</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 7 (CNA) â€“ U.S. President Trump announced a 100% tariff on chips. He said that if companies promise to build factories in the U.S. or are already building them there, they will not have to pay this tariff. For now, people think this is good news for TSMC. However, lawmakers are worried that Trump is often pushing TSMC to invest more in the U.S. They are concerned if Taiwan can keep its leading position in the industry. Liu Jing-ching, the head of the National Development Council and also a board member of TSMC, strongly said that "the key technology will be protected."</p>
            <p>Today, Liu Jing-ching went to the Legislative Yuan's Economic Committee. He gave a report on "Taiwan's future economic situation and new plans for global industry after the U.S. equal tariff is decided." Lawmakers from different parties were interested in Trump's announcement today about the 100% chip tariff and also about TSMC's investments.</p>
            <p>Lawmaker Zhang Qikai from the Taiwan People's Party was worried that a 100% chip tariff would make the semiconductor supply chain move to the U.S. faster. Lawmaker Xie Yifeng from the Kuomintang was concerned about how to keep TSMC's advantages in Taiwan, as the U.S. wants TSMC to invest more.</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching explained three points. First, when the government approves, key technologies and the newest technologies will not be sent out first. TSMC's advanced 1.4 nanometer and 2 nanometer processes are both in Taiwan, so the key technology can be protected. Second, most of TSMC's more than 10,000 research and development staff are in Taiwan. Third, TSMC's important leadership team and main office are also in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Based on these three points, Liu Jing-ching believes that TSMC's advantages "will definitely be protected."</p>
            <p>Regarding investments, Liu Jing-ching said that TSMC is building factories in Kaohsiung and Chiayi, and also a new factory in Taichung. "TSMC's investment in Taiwan is much more than its investment in the United States."</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching also said that every company invests only when they have orders. Looking at TSMC's production capacity and factory plans, TSMC's investment in the U.S. "is not moving out, but expanding."</p>

            <h1>Analysis: Trump's Sanctions on India for Russian Oil May Change US-India Efforts Against China</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 6 (CNA) â€“ U.S. President Trump today put more pressure on India for buying Russian oil. He added another 25% tariff on Indian goods going to the U.S., making the total tariff 50%. Some analyses say that Trump's action is not good for getting India to work with the U.S. against China. Also, if India stops buying Russian oil right away, global oil prices could go up very high.</p>
            <p>Last week, Trump set the "equal tariff" on India at 25%. Now, he added another 25%, saying India is "helping" Russia's war. This makes the total tariff on Indian goods going to the U.S. 50%.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a financial news website, said that the U.S. had encouraged India to buy Russian oil before. Unlike liquid natural gas (LNG), Russian crude oil was not banned by sanctions, but its price was capped. Data from Kpler, a global trade data company, shows that Russia exports about 3.35 million barrels of crude oil every day. India buys about 1.7 million barrels of this, and China buys 1.1 million barrels.</p>
            <p>Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House energy advisor during the George W. Bush administration, told CNBC that Indian officials must be very confused now.</p>
            <p>McNally said, "After Russia invaded Ukraine, [then-U.S. President] Biden went to India and asked them to buy Russian oil. At that time, India imported almost no Russian oil. The U.S. asked India to 'please buy this oil' to keep oil prices low, and India did. Now, we are asking them why they are buying so much Russian oil."</p>
            <p>People in India's oil industry told CNBC that if India stopped buying Russian crude oil today, "global crude oil prices could go above 200 U.S. dollars per barrel, and consumers in all countries would be affected."</p>
            <p>Indian oil industry insiders pointed out that when the U.S. doesn't want India to buy something, they usually say so directly. Before, when India bought oil from Iran, they stopped because they followed Washington's sanctions on Iran. But now, India is being sanctioned by the U.S.</p>
            <p>Sara Vakhshouri, founder and president of SVB International Energy (SVBEI), a global energy strategy consulting company, told CNBC that Trump's heavy tariffs on India are probably a "negotiating tactic." The goal is to get back the oil market share the U.S. lost in India since 2022, make up for less exports, and ensure more other goods can enter India.</p>
            <p>Vakhshouri said, "India has always worked closely with the U.S. on oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil. However, for the Trump administration, energy security, affordable prices, and steady supply are the main things they care about."</p>
            <p>Analysts say that Trump's harsh tariffs on India mean the relationship between the U.S. and India, who are important partners in security and defense, might get worse.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post said that during President Biden's time, the U.S. government was more accepting of India economically than of other countries that kept ties with Russia. At the same time, the U.S. and India also worked closely in some parts of Asia to stand against China's influence.</p>
            <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the first foreign leaders to meet Trump after he came back into politics. At that time, they announced plans to build new cooperation in defense and energy. In June this year, Trump accepted Modi's invitation to attend the Quad leaders' summit (U.S., Japan, India, Australia) hosted by India later this year. It is now worth watching if this plan will change.</p>
            <p>Recently, Trump has started to build stronger relationships with Pakistan, India's main rival. He even tried to help solve the long-running dispute between the two countries over the Kashmir region through social media.</p>
            <p>The New York Times pointed out that part of the U.S. strategy to be friends with India is based on the security situation in Asia. However, India's appeal for the U.S. to form a partnership still largely depends on its economic potential.</p>
            <p>Companies like Apple have invested billions of dollars in India. In 2023, India's population became larger than China's. This made foreign investors interested in India's large local market and its potential to become another world factory. U.S. investments in India are not just for profit. They are also to lessen or even stop relying on China.</p>
            <p>However, the 25% "equal tariff" alone already makes India less competitive than Asian rivals like Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea, who have lower tariffs. If the tariff goes up to 50%, the U.S. plan to build supply chains with India will completely fail.</p>
            <p>Besides buying Russian oil, Trump also targeted India's pharmaceutical industry on August 5. India is very competitive in making medicines worldwide and exports more than 10 billion U.S. dollars worth of related products to the U.S. each year. But Trump is planning to put a special tariff of up to 250% on medicines sold to the U.S., saying he will announce it in about a week.</p>
            <p>Currently, almost 40% of the generic medicines sold in the U.S. are made in India. Eli Lilly, an American drug company, recently invested 3 billion U.S. dollars to build a factory in India, and it will also be affected.</p>
            <p>The New York Times pointed out that by threatening a high tariff of 50%, Trump seems to be giving up the original U.S. policy of supporting India as a strategic point against China. At least, it will be harder to expect India to work more closely with the U.S. on issues related to China.</p>
            <p>Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official who now works at the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank in New Delhi, said that this move by the U.S. will make India "rethink its strategic position, and it might strengthen its relationships with Russia, China, and other countries even more."</p>
