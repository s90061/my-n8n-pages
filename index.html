            <h1>US-Russia Summit Reaches No Ceasefire Agreement; Czech Parliament Speaker: Trump Did Not Effectively Pressure</h1>
            <p>Prague, August 16 (CNA) ‚Äì The Speaker of the Czech Parliament, Mark√©ta Pekarov√° Adamov√°, said that Donald Trump did not put enough pressure on Vladimir Putin during their meeting in Alaska. She said this was because they did not reach an agreement. She added that Trump "let the criminal Putin return to the world stage but got nothing in return."</p>
            <p>Some Czech politicians also said that Putin does not want peace. Instead, he wants to make Western countries less united and spread his own ideas. They asked Western countries to continue working together to support Ukraine.</p>
            <p>On August 15, US President Donald Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, USA. They talked about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. Many people hoped for a lot from this meeting, but the two leaders did not agree to stop the war.</p>
            <p>About this, Mark√©ta Pekarov√° Adamov√°, the Speaker of the Czech House of Representatives, wrote on social media platform X. She said Trump failed to put effective pressure and reach a basic agreement. She stated, "Instead, he let the criminal Putin come back to the international stage, but got nothing."</p>
            <p>Adamov√° criticized, "This is not diplomacy. This is a dangerous gift to the attacker, and a hard hit to Ukraine, which is still fighting for its life." She said the meeting showed again that Putin does not want peace. For him, war is a way to spread his message, and he mostly wants to remove Ukraine from the world map.</p>
            <p>The Czech Foreign Minister, Jan Lipavsk√Ω, said, "I welcome Trump's effort to end the war. I also welcome his talks with European leaders. He will tell the results of the talks to European countries, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy."</p>
            <p>Lipavsk√Ω also said that what Putin said at the press conference about "the reasons for the conflict" was like the nonsense he often promotes on state TV. "The problem is Russia's desire to control other countries, not Ukraine's wish to live freely. Remember, behind Putin's words is his plan to bring the security system back to how it was in 1997. At that time, the Czech Republic was not part of NATO."</p>
            <p>Lipavsk√Ω warned that stopping this situation is very important for the Czech Republic's survival. If Putin truly wanted to talk about peace, he would not attack Ukraine every day.</p>
            <p>The Czech Defense Minister, Jana ƒåernochov√°, stated on X that Russian President Putin does not want peace. Instead, he wants to weaken Western unity and spread his ideas. She thinks the talks did not lead to a big step towards ending the war in Ukraine. The West should stay united and continue to support Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The Czech Deputy Prime Minister, Marian Jureƒçka, thinks the talks in Alaska were a good thing in themselves. But it's sad that it's clear Putin does not truly want peace. He also does not want to stop the needless deaths of innocent people. "If he had that wish, Russia's attacks on Ukraine would stop immediately."</p>
            <p>Marek ≈Ωen√≠≈°ek, the Czech Minister of Science, Research and Innovation, has a similar view. He thinks Putin does not want peace now. If he did, he would have already left Ukraine. "Russia's desire to control other countries is a threat we must fight against. It was true yesterday, it is true today, and it will be true tomorrow."</p>
            <p>Zdenƒõk H≈ôib, the leader of the Pirate Party, also said, "The Russian dictator just led Trump by the nose. He used Trump to spread lies and to show that he is a partner for talks with the US."</p>
            <p>H≈ôib repeated that Russia is the attacker. The free world must keep asking the Russian leader to stop fighting right away and talk about peace honestly. If Moscow does not agree to this basic request quickly, then countries must take economic and military actions that will really hurt the Russian government. He also stressed, "We must focus on building a strong and united Europe."</p>

            <h1>China to Implement Mandatory Social Security; State Media Calls It a "Consumption Catalyst"</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 16 (CNA) ‚Äì China will start a mandatory social insurance system on September 1. This has made many businesses and workers worried. Today, the Chinese state media, People's Daily, wrote that social insurance is a "basic safety net" for individuals. For companies, it is a "ticket to the future." For China, it is a "social stabilizer" and also a "driver for spending."</p>
            <p>On August 1, China's Supreme People's Court gave an explanation. It said that agreements between employers and employees not to pay social insurance fees are not valid. If workers end their work contracts for this reason, they can ask their employer to pay them money. This explanation will start on September 1.</p>
            <p>After this explanation was made public, many small businesses and low-wage workers in China became worried. They fear they cannot pay the high social insurance costs. Experts say that in the future, many people might choose "flexible employment" or part-time jobs to avoid paying social insurance.</p>
            <p>Today, the People's Daily published a comment. It said that the recent talks about "mandatory social insurance for everyone" have caused much discussion. It is important to make clear any misunderstandings of the policy and any wrong information given to the public.</p>
            <p>The article said that the Supreme Court's explanation does not create "new rules." Instead, it makes legal judgments the same across the country. This removes differences in how laws are used in different areas. It is not "mandatory" only now. According to China's labor law and social insurance law, paying social insurance has always been required. Also, it does not cover "everyone," but only workers as defined by law.</p>
            <p>The article criticized that a few online media, to get attention, use words like "everyone," "mandatory," and "new rules." This only misleads the public and causes confusion.</p>
            <p>This People's Daily comment gave three reasons to support mandatory social insurance.</p>
            <p>The article said that for individuals, social insurance is a "basic safety net," not an "optional extra." It also suggested that some workers doubt joining social insurance because they "only consider short-term money and not long-term risks." They worry that companies will find ways to avoid the benefits of the system.</p>
            <p>The article also said that for businesses, social insurance is a "ticket to the future," not a "burden of rules." It explained that making social insurance cover more people and making payments stricter will indeed bring some cost pressure to businesses, especially small and medium-sized ones. But this is not a reason to "avoid social insurance."</p>
            <p>This comment stated that not paying social insurance is against the law. Also, if a company gets an advantage in "price competition" by doing this, how can it last long today when we want good quality development and "investing in people"? With this big trend, companies must pay great attention to legal risks. They must stop trying to lower costs by not paying social insurance. Instead, they should improve in other areas and develop special skills to move to higher levels of the industry and value chain.</p>
            <p>The article also mentioned that we must face the real business pressures on small and medium-sized companies. The key to solving this problem is to offer more ways to help businesses.</p>
            <p>The article also claimed that for the country, social insurance is a "social stabilizer" and a "driver for spending." It said that social insurance gives basic protection for health, old age, and unemployment. People will then need to save less money "just in case." Instead, they will use more of their income for improving their lives, travel, hobbies, and personal growth. The better the social insurance protection, the more it will encourage spending.</p>
            <p>Finally, this People's Daily comment said that social insurance is not the only way to help everyone have a good life. But doing social insurance work well and steadily is the right thing to do now.</p>
