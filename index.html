            <h1>Tesla Approves Large Stock Bonus to Keep Elon Musk as Leader</h1>
            <p>Tesla, a big American electric car company, announced today that its CEO, Elon Musk, will get 96 million shares of special stock. This is a temporary bonus while his original pay contract is being discussed in court. This bonus is worth about 29 billion US dollars (around 864.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, a court in Delaware canceled Musk's record-setting pay contract of 55.8 billion US dollars (around 1.66 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) from 2018. The court said the way Tesla's board approved it was not fair to the shareholders.</p>
            <p>Musk appealed the decision in March. He said the judge made several legal mistakes when canceling his pay contract.</p>
            <p>After that, Tesla said its board had created a special group to talk about some pay issues related to Musk. They did not give more details.</p>
            <p>Tesla gave information to US regulators today. The special group said that if the Delaware court fully approves Musk's 2018 performance bonus for the CEO again, this new temporary stock bonus will be canceled or reduced. This is to make sure he does not get paid twice.</p>
            <p>For Musk to receive these shares, he must stay in a key leadership role at Tesla until the end of 2027. Also, he cannot sell the shares for five years, unless it is to cover taxes or the cost of buying the shares.</p>
            <p>Tesla's special group explained that this bonus is meant to slowly increase Musk's voting power. Musk and Tesla's shareholders have always said this is important to keep him focused on growing Tesla's business.</p>
            <p>The group said, "We know that Musk's other business projects, interests, and needs will take up a lot of his time and attention. But... we also believe that this bonus will encourage him to stay at Tesla."</p>

            <h1>Trump Criticizes India for Buying Russian Oil and Threatens Higher Tariffs</h1>
            <p>US President Trump posted on his social media today, "Truth Social," that India is buying Russian oil and does not care how many people Russia's war machine has killed in Ukraine. He said he will greatly increase the taxes (tariffs) on goods from India.</p>
            <p>Reuters and other news sources reported that Trump wrote on "Truth Social": "India is not only buying a lot of Russian oil, but they are also selling a large part of it on the open market and making a huge profit."</p>
            <p>Trump added, "They don't care how many people the Russian war machine has killed in Ukraine. Because of this, I will greatly increase the tariffs India has to pay to the United States."</p>
            <p>Last month, Trump announced that starting August 1st, he would put a 25% tariff on goods from India. He also said that India buys most of its military equipment from Russia and is Russia's biggest energy buyer, similar to China. He added that the US will put more punishments on India because of these situations.</p>
            <p>However, two Indian government sources, who did not want to be named, recently said that India will continue to buy oil from Russia, even though Trump has threatened to punish them.</p>

            <h1>Tensions Between US and Europe Lessen, EU Delays Trade Actions Against US for 6 Months</h1>
            <p>Olof Gill, a spokesperson for trade at the European Commission, said today that the European Union's planned trade actions against the United States, which were supposed to start on August 7th, will be delayed for 6 months.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC and other financial news, Gill stated, "On July 27, 2025, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and US President Trump reached an agreement about tariffs and trade."</p>
            <p>Gill also said, "The EU and the US are still working together to finalize a joint statement, based on the agreement from July 27. To meet these goals, the European Commission will take the necessary steps to stop the revenge tariffs against the US, which were planned for August 7th, for a period of 6 months."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that people familiar with the situation said the EU expects Trump to announce new rules this week. These rules will officially confirm lower tariffs on cars from the EU and allow some industrial products, like airplane parts, to be free from tariffs.</p>
            <p>The sources also mentioned that the US and EU are expected to release a joint statement that will explain the political promises Trump and von der Leyen made last month.</p>
