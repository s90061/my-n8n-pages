            <h1>Taiwan Normal University Women's Football Blood Test Case: Coach Chou Tai-ying Sent for Further Questioning</h1>
            <p>There was a disagreement about blood tests for the Taiwan Normal University women's football team. Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office asked the Taipei City Investigation Office to search three places: the home and office of Coach Chou Tai-ying. They also questioned Coach Chou and asked four witnesses, including teacher Chen Chung-ching, to come. All of them were later sent to the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office for more interviews.</p>
            <p>Chou Tai-ying, a famous former Taiwanese women's football player and coach for the Taiwan Normal University team, is accused. People say she threatened players that she would lower their grades if they did not join a research project that needed blood tests. On July 16, the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office started an investigation after reading news reports. They put a special team in charge of this case.</p>
            <p>The investigators first asked the Ministry of Education, the National Science and Technology Council, National Central University, and National Taiwan Normal University for information about the research project. They also talked to one research assistant and 18 current or former women's football players. Twelve of these players were questioned again by the prosecutors.</p>
            <p>After looking at all the documents and money records, the investigators believe that Chou Tai-ying might be guilty of cheating and stealing. They then asked the court for permission to search places, and the court agreed.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office ordered the Taipei City Investigation Office to search Chou Tai-ying's home and office in three different places. Chou Tai-ying was called in as a person accused of a crime. Four other people, including Chen Chung-ching, were also asked to come as witnesses. In the evening, they were all taken to the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office for more interviews.</p>

            <h1>India Worries About China's Dam on Brahmaputra River, Builds Its Own Dams Faster to Protect Water Supply</h1>
            <p>India is worried that a big dam China plans to build on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet will greatly reduce India's water supply. During the dry season, the water could drop by as much as 85%. Because of this, India is now building its own dams faster to reduce these problems.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that last December, China announced its plan to build the world's largest dam for electricity on the Yarlung Tsangpo River. This will happen in the border area before the river flows into India. India's government in New Delhi is concerned. They fear that China, which claims some parts of India's Arunachal Pradesh state, might use control of the river as a "weapon."</p>
            <p>In July this year, construction started on China's Yarlung Tsangpo Dam. This project will cost 170 billion US dollars (about 5 trillion New Taiwan dollars). When it is finished, it will make enough electricity each year for all of the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Yarlung Tsangpo River starts from the Angsi Glacier. In India, it is known as the Siang River and the Brahmaputra River.</p>
            <p>The Angsi Glacier provides water for over 100 million people in China, India, and Bangladesh. Since the early 2000s, the Indian government has thought about building water projects to control the water from the Angsi Glacier. However, people living in Arunachal Pradesh, near the Chinese border, were worried. They thought that building dams would flood their villages and destroy their way of life. So, they strongly, and sometimes violently, stopped these plans.</p>
            <p>In May this year, India's biggest company for making electricity from water brought its survey equipment to the planned site for the "Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam." Armed police protected them. If this dam is built, it will be the largest dam in India.</p>
            <p>Two people who know about the situation said that high-level Indian government officials have continued to meet this year to speed up the building of dams. The office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi organized one of these meetings in July.</p>
            <p>The Indian government wrote a report, which did not have a date, explaining its worries about the Yarlung Tsangpo Dam. Reuters checked the details of this report with four people who knew about it and was the first to share this information.</p>
            <p>The Chinese government has not shared the details of the Yarlung Tsangpo Dam project with the public. The Indian government's report uses old studies from groups like India's Central Water Commission. It also talks about how big the Yarlung Tsangpo Dam is expected to be.</p>
            <p>According to sources and this report, New Delhi believes that the dam will allow the Chinese government to move as much as 40 billion cubic meters of water. The problem of less water will be especially clear during the dry months. In these months, large areas of India get hotter and drier.</p>
            <p>The Upper Siang Dam project plans to store 14 billion cubic meters of water. This will allow India to release water during the dry season to help with drought. According to sources and the report, Guwahati, an important city that relies on farming and industries that use a lot of water, will benefit. Without the dam, Guwahati's water supply would decrease by about 25% in the dry season. With the dam, it is expected to decrease by only 11%.</p>
            <p>Sources also said that this project could help reduce the terrible effects if the Chinese government releases a lot of water.</p>
            <p>If the Upper Siang Dam's water storage is less than half of its full height, it can completely take in any extra water released from Chinese water projects. Two people with knowledge of the matter said that India is thinking about keeping 30% of the dam's space empty at all times. This is to be ready for unexpected big floods.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Reuters about the Yarlung Tsangpo Dam project. They said that this project has been carefully studied for safety and environmental science. They also said it will not cause any bad problems with water, the environment, or the ground for countries downstream. The spokesperson added that China always acts responsibly when developing and using rivers that flow through different countries. China also keeps talking and working with countries downstream, like India and Bangladesh.</p>

            <h1>NVIDIA Launches New Robot Brain 'Thor'; CEO Jensen Huang Says It Will Lead to 'Physical AI' Era</h1>
            <p>NVIDIA, a big company that makes chips for Artificial Intelligence (AI), announced today that its AI robot computer, the Jetson AGX Thor developer kit and production module, is now available. This new system uses a Blackwell Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It can do AI calculations 7.5 times faster than the previous version and uses 3.5 times less energy. This will help bring about a time of general-purpose robots more quickly.</p>
            <p>Jensen Huang, NVIDIA's CEO, said in a press release that Jetson Thor was created by NVIDIA for the millions of people who build robot systems. These robots can interact with the real world and slowly change how the world looks. Jetson Thor can run many advanced AI models directly on the device. It is a very powerful computer that will help bring us into the age of 'physical AI' and general robot technology.</p>
            <p>Some of the first companies to use Jetson Thor include Agility Robotics, Amazon Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon, Medtronic, and Meta. Also, companies like 1X, John Deere, OpenAI, and Physical Intelligence are looking at Jetson Thor to improve how physical AI works.</p>
            <p>Jetson Thor uses the NVIDIA Blackwell GPU and has 128 GB of memory. It can do 2070 FP4 TFLOPS of AI calculations (which means trillions of calculations per second). It can easily run the newest AI models while using only 130 watts of power.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA said that this new system helps solve one of the biggest challenges in robotics: running many AI tasks at the same time. This allows robots to interact smartly and immediately with people and the real world. Jetson Thor also makes possible an important technology called real-time understanding. This is key for powerful physical AI uses, like human-like robots, farming, and helping with surgery.</p>
            <p>The NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor developer kit is now for sale. Its price starts from 3499 US dollars (about 107,000 New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Since it first came out in 2014, the NVIDIA Jetson platform and NVIDIA's robot tools have attracted over 2 million developers. There is also a network of more than 150 partners who make hardware, software, and sensors for it. The Jetson Orin part of this system helps over 7000 customers in different industries use AI directly on their devices.</p>
