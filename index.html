            <h1>Man Detained for Illegal Fundraising with "Metaverse" Investment Platform</h1>
            <p>A man named Liao and others created a "Metaverse" investment platform last year. They are accused of getting money illegally from people. Yesterday, prosecutors led police to search three places and talk to Liao and six other people. After questioning, the prosecutor today asked to hold Liao and an employee named Hong and stop them from seeing anyone.</p>
            <p>Investigators found that Liao and his group started a platform called ETmeta Metaverse. They held meetings to invite people to invest in "ETM coins." They said that if people let the platform manage their ETM coins, they could earn 1% profit every day. If they managed them for 10 days, they could earn 1% to 2% profit daily. They also said people could take their money out whenever they wanted, and ETM coins could be changed into Tether (a type of digital money).</p>
            <p>Investigators learned that many people invested money in January of last year. At first, they received some interest. But by September last year, they could not take their money out from the platform. That's when people realized they had been tricked. In total, 16 investors reported the crime.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office directed investigators and Taipei City police. They searched the homes and offices of Liao, Hong, another person named Hsu, and four witnesses.</p>
            <p>After questioning them all night, the prosecutor believes Liao and Hong are strongly suspected of breaking laws about banking, fraud, and money laundering. The prosecutor also thinks they might try to talk to others involved. So, today, the prosecutor asked to hold them and prevent them from seeing anyone. The other people questioned were allowed to leave.</p>

            <h1>Fake Learning Portfolios Cause Problems; Student Group Wants Better Ethics Teaching</h1>
            <p>Recently, a student was not allowed to attend Yang Ming Chiao Tung University because their learning portfolio was not true. Today, the student group EdYouth released a report about the 108 curriculum. They suggest that schools should teach more about academic honesty when students create learning portfolios. They also encourage students to say if they used AI in their work.</p>
            <p>The student group EdYouth held a meeting today to release their 4th report on the 108 curriculum. Ten students worked together on the report. From June 4 to July 18, they surveyed 1004 high school students and talked to 54 students. They looked at 9 main topics, including AI and computer education, school counseling, vocational education, and high school entrance exams.</p>
            <p>Lee Ping-hsun, a student at Soochow University and one of the main writers, said that the Ministry of Education has a new "3+2 five-year junior college" program. This program is a partnership between vocational high schools and vocational colleges. However, some national vocational colleges only offer a few spots, and some even have high requirements to get in. For students, the new five-year program, which needs 150 credits over 4 years to get an associate's degree, might not be interesting. Also, many vocational high school students still do not know about this new program.</p>
            <p>Regarding computer education, Lee Ping-hsun pointed out that the report shows 94% of students have used AI that can create things in class. 88% of students think schools should teach students how to use these AI tools correctly and responsibly. At present, high school computer classes are often optional, or they are just talks or experiences. The lessons are not deep enough, and there are not enough teachers or support systems. Also, the lessons do not have clear instructions, and teaching about AI knowledge and ethics is weak.</p>
            <p>Another main writer, Chen Yin-chia, a student at National Chengchi University, said that 34.6% of students believe that different teachers have different standards for checking the learning results in their portfolios. 75.9% of students think that even after the deadline to check work, students should still be allowed to change their learning results. This would give students a chance to make their work better for the university programs they want to apply to.</p>
            <p>Recently, a high school student got accepted into Yang Ming Chiao Tung University's medical program, but their application materials were not true. Another high school student got into National Taiwan University's medical program, but their science project broke research rules. Both students had their admission taken away.</p>
            <p>Chen Yin-chia said that the report also suggests that future learning portfolios should have stronger education on academic honesty. When teachers help students create essays, science projects, written reports, and study results, they should focus on teaching academic honesty. Also, teachers should encourage students to say if they used AI when making their learning portfolios. This would help students understand how to use AI properly as a helpful tool.</p>
            <p>Feng Yu-chieh, a student at Taipei Digital Experimental High School, said that 47% of students do not agree that local language classes help them become more interested in local languages. However, 36% are not happy with the teaching materials, and 30% are not happy with the classes. The report suggests creating local language classes and materials that are organized, focused on local culture, and connected to daily life. It also suggests improving teacher training and pay, and making classes more interactive. This would help avoid relying too much on online classes.</p>
