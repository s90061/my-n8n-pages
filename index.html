            <h1>Survey: German Companies in China Expect Smallest Salary Increases Ever</h1>
            <p>A new report from the German Chamber of Commerce in China shows that actual salary increases for German companies there keep getting smaller. They also expect the lowest salary increases for next year. However, fewer companies plan to cut jobs this year, and the number of foreign workers stays mostly the same.</p>
            <p>The German Chamber of Commerce in China published its 18th "Labor Market and Salary Report" on its website on July 17th. This report is based on answers collected online from April 17th to May 31st this year. 475 member companies of the German Chamber of Commerce in China shared their information.</p>
            <p>The survey results show that actual salary increases were less than expected. German companies in China had an average salary increase of 3.24% this year. This was 0.57 percentage points lower than they thought it would be. For example, in the car industry, companies expected salaries to go up by 3.94%, but they only went up by 2.82%. Overall, this is the third year in a row that average actual salary increases have been lower than expected.</p>
            <p>Regarding future salary increases, the expected rise is the lowest ever. German companies in China think salaries will go up by 3.19% next year. This is 0.62 percentage points lower than the 3.81% they expected for this year. This shows a clear trend of slower salary growth since 2019.</p>
            <p>For new employees, the survey shows that salary changes for new hires and promoted staff were small last year. 72% of companies gave new employees the same or only slightly different salaries compared to their old jobs. Also, 44% of companies gave promoted employees a pay raise of less than 5%.</p>
            <p>However, the report expects fewer job cuts this year. Last year, 29% of the companies surveyed cut jobs. This number has gone down to 21% this year. On the other hand, 24% of companies plan to hire more people this year, which is 10 percentage points more than last year.</p>
            <p>Also, the number of foreign employees is stable. 65.1% of German companies in China hire foreign workers, which is a small increase from 65.0% last year. The main reasons for hiring local Chinese employees instead of foreign ones are salary (67.1%), job stability (35.2%), and business connections (28.3%).</p>
            <p>Clas Neumann, the Chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce in Eastern and Central China, said that German companies are changing their main focus. He noted that job cuts are now steady, they are putting more money into training staff, and foreign experts are still very important, especially for small and medium-sized companies.</p>
            <p>He added that the small expected increases in salaries show that companies are being more realistic about the market and that the job market is stable. The 18th "Labor Market and Salary Report" gives clear information about salary changes in China and the latest trends and important topics in China's job market.</p>

            <h1>Fu Kun-Chi Plans Disaster Relief Law for Southern Taiwan; Hualien Green Camp Says He's Just Saving His Political Future</h1>
            <p>Fu Kun-Chi, a lawmaker from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, announced today that if the central government does not help with fixing damage from recent storms in southern Taiwan, he will work with the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) to propose a special law for emergency disaster relief in Tainan and Chiayi. However, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Hualien criticized him, saying that Fu Kun-Chi is not focused on preventing disasters during heavy rain, but instead is busy trying to save his own political position from being recalled.</p>
            <p>Today, the KMT's Hualien County office held two events called "Anti-Recall, Protect Democracy" to support Fu Kun-Chi. The President of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-Yu, came to Hualien today. He met with Fu Kun-Chi and rode through Hualien City and Ji'an Township in the heavy rain. After that, he went to Ji'an Junior High School for the morning anti-recall event. The second event was at 3 PM in the Yuli Township Art Center.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-Yu said that Hualien is like his second home. He used to be a soldier and a teacher there and feels a deep connection to Hualien. He even voted for the first time by returning north from a military camp in Hualien. He still remembers the "Song of Hualien" he learned 45 years ago and sang it with the people there.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-Yu stated that he is always happy to come to Hualien. But this time, he felt it was strange. He was there to help with elections just one year ago, but now he is there to oppose a recall. He said the DPP is using government money to try and remove 31 KMT lawmakers. He believes this is not democracy but a "political killing" of the opposition party. He asked people to stand together and vote "no" to the recall to protect Taiwan's democracy.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Fu Kun-Chi said that Tainan and Chiayi were badly damaged by the storms, and the government has not yet been able to provide help. He asked the Executive Yuan to quickly propose a special law for emergency disaster relief in Tainan and Chiayi. If the Executive Yuan does not, he said the KMT will work with the TPP to propose it. This is to help people whose roofs were blown off and who cannot live in their homes return to normal life quickly.</p>
            <p>However, Hualien County Councilor Chang Mei-Hui from the DPP and other local DPP politicians criticized Fu Kun-Chi. They said that as the only local lawmaker for Hualien, he is not paying attention to the danger of heavy rain. They also said that local rescue workers are busy dealing with the disaster, but Fu Kun-Chi is busy bringing in big supporters to Hualien to help his political campaign.</p>
            <p>When asked about the Hualien DPP's criticism that he is not helping with disaster relief and is instead focusing on the recall, Fu Kun-Chi replied to reporters after the event. He said he believes the Hualien County government and the disaster prevention center are ready. He also said that lawmakers should let people know about their rights, which is why he is holding local talks. He stated that everyone has their own job, and the DPP should not twist his words too much.</p>
