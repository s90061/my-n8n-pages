            <h1>Investors Watch Trump's Latest Moves, European Stock Markets Show Mixed Results</h1>
            <p>Today, European stock markets had mixed results. Investors were carefully watching the latest news about US President Trump's tariffs and his upcoming meeting with Russian President Putin. After news came out that the US would put tariffs on gold, the price of gold futures reached a new record high.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went down by 5.04 points, or 0.06%, closing at 9095.73 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 29.64 points, or 0.12%, closing at 24162.86 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went up by 33.68 points, or 0.44%, closing at 7743.00 points.</p>
            <p>The British newspaper "Financial Times" reported, quoting a letter from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), that the US is adding tariffs to imported 1-kilogram gold bars. Because of this, the price for December gold futures contracts on the New York Comex exchange reached $3534.10 per ounce during the day.</p>

            <h1>Thai Art Center Removes Exhibition Works Due to Chinese Pressure on Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang Issues</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported that one of Thailand's main art galleries, the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, has changed or removed artworks from an exhibition. These artworks talked about how Beijing treats minority groups and Hong Kong. This happened because China asked them to. Artists say this is another example of China trying to stop criticism from being heard outside its borders.</p>
            <p>The exhibition at the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre is called "Constellation of Complicity: Visualising the Global Machinery of Authoritarian Solidarity." It looks at how strict governments in different countries work together. The artworks are from artists who have left their home countries, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Russia, Iran, and Syria.</p>
            <p>Today, when Reuters reporters visited the exhibition, they saw that some artworks that had been shown and photographed before were gone. This included a multimedia art piece by an artist from Tibet. Also, some artworks were changed, and words like "Hong Kong," "Tibet," and "Uyghur," or the artists' names, were covered up.</p>
            <p>Sai, an artist from Myanmar and one of the exhibition's organizers, said that the exhibition opened on July 24. Three days later, people from the Chinese embassy, along with officials from Bangkok city, came to the exhibition area. They asked for the exhibition to be stopped.</p>
            <p>Reuters saw an email from the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre dated July 30. It said that "the Chinese embassy put pressure on us through the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs and especially our main supporter, the Bangkok City Government. We were warned that this exhibition might cause problems in diplomatic relations between Thailand and China."</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre also said in the letter that they "had no choice but to make some changes," which included covering the names of artists from Hong Kong, Tibet, and Uyghur.</p>
            <p>According to Sai, the Chinese embassy later asked for even more artworks to be removed. These works included the Tibetan snow lion flag, the East Turkestan flag of the Uyghur people, several postcards showing Chinese President Xi Jinping, and one postcard showing the relationship between China and Israel.</p>
            <p>One of the removed works was by Tibetan artist Tenzin Mingyur Paldron. It included a video where Tibetans held the Palestinian flag and asked for justice for genocide. Another video was called "Listen to Indigenous People."</p>
            <p>Reuters reporters saw a black screen where a video player should have been. Also, a video by a Uyghur artist was playing at the site, but the artist's name was covered with black paint.</p>
            <p>Sai said he has left Thailand because the Thai police are looking for him. He also said that his contacts in Bangkok told him that Chinese officials went back to the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre yesterday. They asked for a flyer to be removed and repeated that Thailand must follow the "one China policy."</p>
            <p>Sai said, "It is very sad and ironic that an exhibition about how strict governments work together is stopped because of pressure from a strict government. For a long time, Thailand has been a safe place for people who speak out. But this event sends a worrying message to all artists and activists living away from their homes in this area."</p>

            <h1>Taipei Ranked World's Most Desired City to Live In, Beats Singapore</h1>
            <p>Gensler, a global company for design and architecture, recently released its "City Pulse 2025: The Magnetic City" survey report. Taipei was named the "world's most desired city to live in," coming out ahead of big international cities like Singapore, Sydney, and Berlin.</p>
            <p>Gensler's global survey, "City Pulse 2025: The Magnetic City," collected opinions from 33,000 people living in 65 cities around the world. It looked at why and where people choose to live.</p>
            <p>The survey found the percentage of people in each city who said they were "unlikely" to move.

            <p>According to the Gensler survey, among 152 things that matter, the top 5 reasons people decide to stay in a city for a long time are: "I am not bored in this city," "I feel at home in this city," "I am proud of this city," "This city is becoming better for older people," and "My feeling of belonging to the city grows over time."</p>
            <p>For the United States, the top 10 cities where people most want to live are: Minneapolis (53%), San Antonio (53%), San Diego (50%), Raleigh (49%), Chicago (47%), Tampa (47%), Portland (47%), Phoenix (46%), San Francisco (46%), and Austin (46%).</p>
