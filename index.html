            <h1>Taiwan's Dali Train Station Now Has Elevators and Ramps</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Railways spent over 68.06 million New Taiwan Dollars to build three elevators and an accessible ramp entrance at the back of Dali Station in Toucheng, Yilan County. These new facilities opened today. They will make the station easier and more comfortable for travelers to use.</p>
            <p>The opening ceremony took place at Dali Station at 11 AM. Important people attended, including Liu Shuang-Huo, the Deputy General Manager of Taiwan Railways, Chen Chun-Yu, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party, and Chen Wan-Hui, the head of the Taiwan People's Party in Yilan County.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways said that Dali Station first opened on December 10, 1920. To the east of the station is Dali Old Street, which is a community by the sea. To the west is Dali Tiangong Temple, which is on a mountain. In the past, people from Dali Old Street usually used an underground path south of the station to get to and from the station. They had to walk along Provincial Highway 2, which has a lot of cars. This was very inconvenient and not safe.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways also mentioned that on holidays or special occasions, many visitors go to Tiangong Temple or walk along the Caoling Historic Trail. They all use the station platforms. Older passengers and people who have trouble moving could use a special path with help from the station manager. But it was not very convenient or safe.</p>
            <p>So, to help an aging population, Taiwan Railways decided to spend over 68.06 million New Taiwan Dollars. They used this money to improve Dali Station's accessibility and other facilities. They built three elevators and an accessible ramp entrance at the back of the station. They also updated the handrails, stair surfaces, and added more lights and security cameras. These changes will make it easier for local residents and people with limited mobility to use the train.</p>

            <h1>US Stops Iranian Diplomats from Buying Luxury Goods and Shopping at Stores like Costco</h1>
            <p>The US government under President Trump has now stopped Iranian diplomats in or visiting New York from shopping at big stores like Costco. They also cannot buy expensive luxury items in the US without special permission from the State Department.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the State Department said in a statement: "We will not let Iran's leaders shop freely in New York while Iranian people are suffering from poverty, broken public services, and a severe lack of water and electricity."</p>
            <p>This week, an official notice will be published in the "Federal Register." In this notice, the State Department's Office of Foreign Missions says that things like membership to warehouse stores and the ability to buy watches, fur, jewelry, handbags, wallets, perfume, tobacco, alcohol, and cars are "benefits." These benefits now need approval from the US government for diplomats.</p>
            <p>However, this new rule is only for Iran. Stores like Costco were very popular with Iranian diplomats in and visiting New York. They could buy many products that are not available in Iran at cheaper prices and send them back home.</p>
            <p>The State Department explained: "By stopping Iranian officials from using diplomatic trips to the United Nations to get goods that ordinary Iranian people cannot, we are sending a clear message: when the US says it supports the Iranian people, we mean it."</p>
            <p>This is another step by the Trump government to make visa rules stricter. It also affects leaders and diplomats who want to represent their countries at the United Nations.</p>
            <p>World leaders are meeting this week for an important yearly meeting at the United Nations. But these new US rules will apply all year to any Iranian diplomat working at the United Nations.</p>
