            <h1>Next year's general budget proposal: Cho Jung-tai says a big money problem will lead to borrowing</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Premier, Cho Jung-tai, said today that the government is busy preparing next year's budget. But because of a new law about money for local governments, there will be a big money problem. So, the government will need to borrow money to deal with it.</p>
            <p>The plan for next year's government budget will be ready by the end of August. Premier Cho already held a meeting to check it. A new law about how money is shared means the central government must give 375.3 billion New Taiwan dollars to local governments. Also, money for defense must be more than 3% of the country's total income. People are watching to see how the budget will be made.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan invited Premier Cho and other government leaders to talk about helping areas after Typhoon Danas and the heavy rains on July 28. They also answered questions.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting, Premier Cho talked to reporters. He spoke about whether the government would give out cash to everyone when it changes a special law for recovery. He also talked about if the central government faced problems making next year's budget after the new money-sharing law started.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that the special law for recovery has already been announced and started by President Lai Ching-te. Based on this law, they will carefully study how to change or increase help for certain types of businesses. They hope to change the special law and have the Legislative Yuan approve it. For other parts, they will mostly follow what President Lai announced.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho stated that they are now fully working on next year's central government budget. Because the law about sharing money has changed, there will be a very big financial gap. They will have to borrow money to deal with it. So, next year's central government budget will involve a lot of borrowed money.</p>

            <h1>To end the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump says both countries must give up some land</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump said today that both Kyiv and Moscow must give up some land to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine. This week, Trump will talk with Russian President Putin. This meeting will quickly show if Putin wants to make a deal.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump will meet Putin in Alaska, USA, on August 15. European leaders and Ukraine's President Zelenskyy plan to talk with Trump before this meeting. They are worried that Washington might try to force Ukraine to accept bad peace terms.</p>
            <p>Trump has acted tougher towards Moscow. He agreed to send more U.S. weapons to Ukraine and threatened to put taxes on those who buy Russian oil. But Europe is still worried that Trump might agree to a deal that makes Kyiv give up a lot.</p>
            <p>Kaja Kallas, who handles foreign policy and security for the European Union, said today that to end the war, there needs to be "unity across the Atlantic, support for Ukraine, and pressure on Russia." She added that they must also "stop Russia from attacking Europe in the future."</p>
            <p>At a White House press conference, Trump spoke about his meeting with Putin. He said, "This is really a first talk." He added that they would know if they could make progress "in about the first two minutes."</p>
            <p>He said, "I will tell him (Putin) that you must end this war."</p>
            <p>Trump pointed out that future talks might include Zelenskyy. America's goal is to quickly stop this terrible fight that has lasted three and a half years. He plans to talk with European leaders soon after his meeting with Putin.</p>
            <p>Trump has spoken before about exchanging land, but neither Russia nor Ukraine wants to give up land as part of a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters, "There will be some land exchange."</p>
            <p>The Hill newspaper reported that Trump also said, "So there is good and bad, but the situation is very complicated because the border lines are very uneven. There will be some exchanges and some land changes."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I have learned through talking with Russia and everyone that this is good for Ukraine." He stated that Russia has taken some "very important land," but "we will try to get some important land back."</p>
            <p>BBC reported that Trump mentioned if Putin offers a "fair deal" in the talks, he will tell European leaders about it. He added that, "out of respect," he would talk to Zelenskyy first.</p>
            <p>He said, "I will call him first... I will also call him after the meeting. I might say, 'Good luck, keep fighting,' or I might say, 'We can make a deal.'"</p>
            <p>Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said he spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio today. He posted on X that lasting peace needs "a ceasefire with no conditions, which is the first step for real talks."</p>
