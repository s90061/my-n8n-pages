        const text = `**US-Japan Ties: Rubio Says No Disagreements**

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there are no big problems between the US and Japan, even though Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba recently talked about Japan needing to be less dependent on the US for security and energy.

Rubio also said on July 11 that the US is not forcing Japan to spend a lot more money on defense. Instead, he said Washington is "encouraging" Japan to invest in certain defense abilities, not "demanding" it.

Rubio explained that it's more about what Japan can actually do, rather than just how much money they spend. This comes after reports last month that the Trump government asked Japan and other Asian allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, similar to what the US asks of NATO countries.

There were also reports that Japan cancelled a yearly meeting with US defense and foreign ministers after the US asked for more defense spending. Also, President Trump announced that the US would put a 25% tax on Japanese goods starting August 1, which made Japan unhappy.

On July 10, Ishiba said that Japan needs to try and be more independent in defense, food, and energy, and rely less on the US.

When asked about Ishiba's comments, Rubio said on July 11, "The US and Japan have a very strong and good relationship, and this will not change." He added that anyone looking for problems between the two countries is wrong because their relationship is very strong.

Rubio also said that Ishiba's comments should not be seen in a bad way. He stated, "Japan becoming stronger militarily is not an insult to us, but it encourages us."

**'Bad Doctor' Search Platform Coming Soon, Possibly by August**

A new online platform to check for "bad doctors" could be ready by August. This platform will help people find out if a doctor has been found guilty in certain legal cases, especially those related to sexual misconduct. This will make going to the doctor less like a "blind box" experience.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan said today that they are waiting for information from the Judicial Yuan (Taiwan's judicial branch). They plan to combine this new platform with the existing system for checking medical professionals.

Liu Yueh-ping, head of the Department of Medical Affairs, said the platform will definitely be launched by August. She explained that the information will come from public court rulings, especially for sexual misconduct cases. Even if they cannot automatically link with the Judicial Yuan's system, they will manually upload the information.

Liu also said that the court rulings are public, so there are no privacy issues. For other cases, like those being investigated or decided by schools or hospitals, more legal discussion is needed before they can be included.

The new platform will be part of the current medical professional search system. It will have different sections, so people can access the new database from the same website.

Liu explained that even if a medical professional has chosen to hide their information in the existing system (to prevent stalking, for example), their information will still be shown on the new platform if they have a confirmed court ruling against them.

She also reminded people that they can always check a doctor's license at a hospital to make sure they are legally practicing medicine.

**India Air Crash: First Report Released, Showing Key Moments**

On June 12, an Air India plane crashed into a residential area shortly after taking off in western India, killing 260 people. One month later, on July 12, Indian investigators released their first report, showing the important moments before the accident.

The report says that the fuel control switches for both engines were turned from "operate" to "cut off" at almost the same time. This stopped the fuel from going to the engines.

Here are the key times (Taiwan time) from the report:

*   **1:47 PM, June 12:** Air India flight AI423, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, landed in Ahmedabad after flying from New Delhi.
*   **3:48:38 PM:** The plane left its parking spot.
*   **3:55:15 PM:** The plane asked for permission to taxi and got it. About a minute later, it moved to Runway 23 and waited for takeoff.
*   **4:02:03 PM:** The plane's control was handed over to the control tower.
*   **4:07:33 PM:** The plane was allowed to take off.
*   **4:07:37 PM:** The plane started its takeoff run.
*   **4:08:39 PM:** The plane left the ground.
*   **4:08:42 PM:** The plane reached its fastest speed of about 333 kilometers per hour. "Right after this, the fuel control switches for Engine 1 and Engine 2 were turned from 'operate' to 'off,' only one second apart."

Because the fuel was cut off, the engines started to slow down. In the cockpit recording, one pilot asked the other why the fuel switches were turned off, and the other pilot said they did not turn them off.

Airport security video shows that the plane's emergency power system (RAT) turned on shortly after takeoff. The plane started to lose height before it even left the airport area.

*   **4:08:47 PM:** Both engines slowed down to less than their lowest idle speed. Then, the RAT's hydraulic pump started to provide power.
*   **4:08:52 PM:** Engine 1's fuel switch was turned from "off" to "operate."
*   **4:08:56 PM:** Engine 2's fuel switch was also turned from "off" to "operate."

Engine 1 started to speed up again after slowing down. Engine 2 also restarted, but it kept losing speed. Fuel was put back into it many times to try and get it to speed up and become stable.

*   **4:09:05 PM:** One of the pilots made an emergency call: "MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY."
*   **4:09:11 PM:** The data recording stopped.
*   **4:14:44 PM:** Airport fire trucks arrived at the crash site to help.
