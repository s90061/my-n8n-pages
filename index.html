        const text = `**Math Exam Easier Than Expected, Say Tutors**

Taiwan's special exam, called the "Division Exam," now includes a new math test called "Math B." This is the first time this test has been given. Tutors say the test was quite easy, just as they thought it would be. There wasn't too much calculating needed.

Teachers from a tutoring center looked at the "Math B" test for the 2025 school year. They said the scores were as follows: 49 for the highest, 44 for high, 36 for average, 29 for low, and 25 for the lowest scores. Since this is the first time for "Math B," there are no past scores to compare it to.

One tutor, Mr. Chieh Chuang-chih, explained that the "Math B" test was added to give students a second chance. Because of this, they didn't expect it to be very hard. He said that the first two questions were very simple, which might have surprised students.

Mr. Chieh also said that this year's "Math A" test had more geometry, while "Math B" had a good mix of all topics. There were no long calculations or long stories in the questions. He believes that even if students did not do well on the previous main exam, the "General Scholastic Ability Test," they could still get a good score on this test with some preparation. This gives them encouragement.

Another tutor, Mr. Wei Shang-chih, said that questions 16 to 18 were about "linear programming," which is often on the old "Designated Subject Examination." Students probably expected these questions and were happy to answer them. Only question 9, which was a multiple-choice question about winning money by drawing cards, needed more calculation to find the chances and expected values.

Mr. Wei also thought question 13, about "differentiation" and graphs, was not too hard for students who studied the high school third-year topics. Question 11, about "arrangements and combinations," was also manageable if students paid attention to the rule that the "first type of fabric" could not be used with "feature A" at the same time.

Teachers from a national high school education union said that the "Math B" test was medium to easy. Some questions focused on reading and understanding. Students who understood the basic ideas from their textbooks and practiced basic questions could get good scores. There wasn't a big difference for students who studied "Math A" or "Math B" in their second year of high school.

However, a team of teachers from a national teachers' association thought that for students who chose "Math A" in high school, the test was easy to start. But for students who chose "Math B," it was a little harder.
