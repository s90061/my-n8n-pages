Younger generations, like Gen Z (people born roughly between 1997 and 2012), are changing how they use social media. Many are becoming tired of public platforms where they share every part of their lives. Instead, they prefer to connect in smaller, more private groups or through direct messages.

They are looking for more real and meaningful connections online. Some even try "digital detoxes," which means spending less time on their phones or social media apps. When they do use social media, it's often for specific interests or hobbies, not just to see what everyone else is doing.

This change is important for social media companies and advertisers. It shows that the way people interact online is always developing, and what was popular before might not be popular now.

**How AI is Changing Jobs Around the World**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a big impact on the job market. Some jobs that involve repetitive tasks are disappearing, as AI can now do them faster and more cheaply. For example, AI can write basic reports, handle customer service, or analyze large amounts of data. This means some people may lose their current jobs.

However, AI is also creating many new jobs. These new roles often involve working *with* AI, such as training AI systems, designing AI tools, or managing AI's outputs. There's also a growing need for jobs that require human skills like creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence, which AI cannot easily replicate.

Experts say that learning new skills, especially those related to technology and human-focused tasks, will be very important for workers in the future. The goal is often for humans and AI to work together, making tasks more efficient rather than AI completely replacing people.

**Popular European Cities Facing Challenges from Too Many Tourists**

Many popular European cities are facing a problem called "overtourism." This means that too many tourists visit these places, which can cause difficulties for local residents and the environment. For example, it can make public transport very crowded, increase housing prices, and damage historical sites or nature.

To deal with this, some cities are trying new ideas to control the number of visitors. Venice, Italy, for instance, has started charging a small fee for day-trippers to enter the city on busy days. Other places, like Amsterdam, are limiting the size of tour groups or making rules about short-term rental homes.

The main aim of these changes is to encourage more sustainable tourism. This way, both tourists and local people can enjoy the cities, and the beautiful places can be protected for the future.
