            <h1>High-Speed Rail Extension to Yilan: Former Minister Calls for Stop or Rejection</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 20 (CNA) Today, a meeting about the environmental impact of the high-speed rail extension to Yilan was held. He Chen-Dan, a former Minister of Transportation, believes that this plan makes the high-speed rail seem too good. He says it ignores whether all Taiwan Railway (TRA) trains for the eastern part of Taiwan can start from Yilan, and the huge costs needed for this. He asked the committee to stop reviewing the plan or send it back.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment held its 37th meeting today. They looked at the first draft of the "High-Speed Rail Extension to Yilan Project Environmental Impact Assessment Report."</p>
            <p>Groups like "Citizen Help," "High-Speed Rail Extension to Yilan Monitoring Alliance," "TRA Union," and "Guard Yilan Workshop" held a press conference outside the Ministry of Environment this morning. They asked for the "perfect high-speed rail" plan to be stopped and for "direct railways" to be treated fairly.</p>
            <p>Former Minister of Transportation He Chen-Dan supported these groups. He directly called the plan "silly." He said it used engineering reports to make high-speed rail look good and TRA look bad. He felt the planning was too quick, without talking to important groups or getting public opinions. He also said the numbers were messy and not complete.</p>
            <p>He Chen-Dan said that the plan did not finish its study to see if it was possible. He said the National Development Council did not agree that the Executive Yuan had already approved it. He also noted that only one public meeting was held for the people of Yilan, who would be most affected. He said the project group only made small visits to the county council to pretend they were communicating, or they just counted visits to communities as real discussions.</p>
            <p>He Chen-Dan believes this plan only shows good numbers and makes the TRA's strength and help seem less important. It says TRA can only wait at the new Yilan station for high-speed rail transfers. But it does not consider if all TRA trains for eastern Taiwan can start from Yilan and the very high costs for setting up such systems.</p>
            <p>Qiu Shu-Sheng, a representative from the TRA Union, said this plan is not just about making travel to Yilan shorter. He said getting passengers to Yilan is the real challenge. He even mentioned that a report from the Railway Bureau yesterday suggested how TRA should work with the new high-speed rail to Yilan. He found this very ironic, and it shows how the entire railway system in eastern Taiwan will be affected.</p>
            <p>Qiu Shu-Sheng said if the high-speed rail to Yilan is built, it will directly affect a very important part of TRA's business across the island. He also said it would be a clear sign that the Ministry of Transportation and the central government will stop trying to make TRA a private company. He said this decision affects many things, and as a railway worker, he is against it.</p>
            <p>According to a presentation by the Ministry of Transportation's Railway Bureau, the Ministry held meetings last year with the Railway Bureau and the company that runs the current high-speed rail in western Taiwan. They discussed how to build and run the new high-speed rail. They had many meetings in groups focusing on engineering, land use, operations, law, and money. All ideas from these meetings were put into the plan to meet future operation needs.</p>
            <p>The Railway Bureau repeated that building railways not only solves traffic problems but also helps develop Yilan, Hualien, and Taitung. It is an important basic structure. The goal is to have a railway network that goes around the whole island in 6 hours and helps different parts of Taiwan develop equally.</p>

            <h1>Minister Hong Shen-Han's Comments on Bill for 80-Year-Olds to Hire Foreign Caregivers Cause Disagreement</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 20 (CNA) Before a big recall vote, Minister of Labor Hong Shen-Han wrote on Facebook. He mentioned that a law letting people over 80 hire foreign caregivers without a special assessment passed quickly through a committee. Today, opposition party (KMT) lawmakers said he was spreading lies. They also pointed out that Hong Shen-Han was not the minister when the law was being reviewed. They asked government officials to act with skill and truth.</p>
            <p>Before the recall vote on July 26, Hong Shen-Han wrote on Facebook that the majority in the parliament was trying to take power from government bodies. He used the change to Article 46 of the Employment Service Act as an example. He said the law passed through the committee too fast. He added that lawmakers from the opposition knew the law would cause problems, but they voted for it quickly without enough discussion.</p>
            <p>At that time, opposition lawmakers said Hong Shen-Han was not being fair as a government official. Today, the Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee in the parliament asked Hong Shen-Han to give a special report and answer questions. Wang Yu-Min, a lawmaker from the KMT, was unhappy and asked Hong Shen-Han to explain why he thought the change to Article 46 of the Employment Service Act passed so quickly.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-Min said that she was the leader of the committee at that time, and the law did not pass quickly. She said it was discussed twice in the committee. There were also talks between the different political parties, and later, a public meeting was held. She asked why Hong Shen-Han would openly lie on Facebook.</p>
            <p>Hong Shen-Han explained many times that his Facebook post was just an example using a few laws. He specially mentioned the change to Article 46 of the Employment Service Act because it skipped a meeting that should have been called by the head of the parliament, Han Kuo-Yu. He had wanted to discuss it well with the lawmakers in that meeting.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-Min disagreed, saying that Hong Shen-Han was also a lawmaker before, and "not every law needs to go through Han Kuo-Yu's meeting." She said the change to Article 46 of the Employment Service Act was reviewed in the committee. She strongly disagreed that the law "passed quickly." She also said Hong Shen-Han was not the Minister of Labor when the committee reviewed the law, so he was not part of the review. She added that "his words are completely wrong."</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-Min finally said that the goal of the law was to make things simpler and easier for people. She felt the Ministry of Labor was making the problems seem bigger, saying the change would have a huge effect. But she noted that only about 1,400 people have applied so far. She believed that government officials should act with knowledge and truth, not make such claims.</p>
            <p>Hong Shen-Han replied that looking at the numbers now, the number of applications in the second week was twice as many as in the first week. He said that this shows a clear trend of growth.</p>

            <h1>Hong Kong Media: Chinese Companies in Hong Kong Now Strictly Follow China's "Eight Provisions"</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong, August 20 (CNA) News reports say that Chinese companies in Hong Kong have been strictly learning and following the "Eight Provisions" from the Chinese Communist Party for the last six months. These rules were made in 2012 to stop bad habits like using public money for food and drinks, and having too many meetings.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported that after China's main political meetings this year, Beijing started a new round of "deeply studying and putting into practice the spirit of the Central Eight Provisions." Chinese companies in Hong Kong have also held many learning meetings in the last six months. They have also filled out forms to check themselves.</p>
            <p>The report said that in the past, Chinese company staff in Hong Kong only had to follow easier "Hong Kong versions of the Eight Provisions" because of the special local situation. But after Beijing started this new study, the newest instruction is that Chinese company staff in Hong Kong must also follow the strict rules from mainland China. There will be no more flexible "Hong Kong Eight Provisions."</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that someone from a pro-Beijing group in Hong Kong said that even though the rules for politicians in Hong Kong are different from mainland China, pro-Beijing groups in Hong Kong have recently started learning about the "Eight Provisions." For example, they are thinking about "how to fix doing things only for show or wasting money, and they should always think about this," especially when they have parties or dinners.</p>
            <p>The "Eight Provisions" are rules inside the Chinese Communist Party. They were agreed upon on December 4, 2012. They include making meetings and documents shorter, saving money, acting honestly as officials, and strictly following rules about how they live their lives.</p>
