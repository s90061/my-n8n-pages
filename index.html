            <p>The Transport Bureau also expects heavy traffic on Zuonan Road, Cuihua Road, Junxiao Road, and National Highway No. 10. They suggest taking Minzu Road, Bo'ai Road, or High-Speed Rail Road for north-south travel. For east-west travel, they suggest taking Jiachang Road, Xinzhuang 1st Road, or Shuiguan Road.</p>

To get to the concert, take the MRT to R17 World Games Station on the Red Line. From there, it's a 5 to 8-minute walk to the venue. For leaving the concert, Kaohsiung Metro has planned to increase MRT services. Trains will come every 3 to 5 minutes to help people leave smoothly.</p>

            <h1>Former Airline Manager Accused of Spying for China; MAC Says Staff Are Highly Alert</h1>
            <p>The High Prosecutors Office announced today that a former manager named Qiao from an airline tried to get secret information about research projects from officials at the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) for Chinese intelligence. He also tried to bribe them with NT$100,000, but they refused. The MAC said today that its staff are very aware and careful.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office issued a press release. It said that from 2012 to 2014, when Qiao was an airline representative in mainland China, he tried to get and collect secret information about outsourced research projects from MAC officials for Chinese intelligence agencies.</p>
            <p>The High Prosecutors Office found that Qiao also tried to give NT$100,000 in cash as a bribe for the Chinese intelligence agencies. However, the official refused the money, so he did not succeed.</p>
            <p>The MAC responded in writing today. They said that many of the MAC's research projects are secret, and many people try to get this information. Luckily, the MAC staff are very careful and alert.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, prosecutors charged Qiao with breaking the National Security Act and corruption laws.</p>
