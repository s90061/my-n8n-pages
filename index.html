            <h1>Cooling US Job Market Boosts Hopes for Interest Rate Cuts; European Stocks Mostly Up</h1>
            <p>Last week, more people in the US asked for unemployment money than expected. Also, a company called ADP reported that private companies in the US added fewer new jobs in August. Investors hope this job market data will make it more likely that the US will lower interest rates. Because of this, most major European stock markets went up today.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 38.88 points, or 0.42%, ending at 9216.87 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up by 175.53 points, or 0.74%, closing at 23770.33 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 20.79 points, or 0.27%, closing at 7698.92 points.</p>
            <p>Investors are now waiting for new numbers from the US government tomorrow. They hope the Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates even more.</p>

            <h1>Dongtai High School Wins Basketball Championship, Hopes to Build Team Confidence</h1>
            <p>The "Peak Performance" Youth Basketball Invitational Tournament for high school teams had its last day today. Dongtai High School won the boys' championship game by beating Nanhu High School 69 to 65. Coach Gao Ding-Guo-Zhu believes this win will give the team more confidence.</p>
            <p>The main event of the "Peak Performance" Youth Basketball Invitational Tournament, held at the Taipei Gymnasium, was the boys' high school championship game. Dongtai played against Nanhu again. Both teams played very closely throughout the game. In the fourth quarter, Dongtai used its special defense, which made Nanhu score only 9 points. Also, the point guard Quan Yi kept the offense steady. In the end, Dongtai won by 4 points and took the championship title.</p>
            <p>After the game, Dongtai's coach Gao Ding-Guo-Zhu told CNA that the last time they played, it was also a very close game, but they lost. He was very happy to play against Nanhu again and win. He hopes this championship will give the players more confidence and help them fix their weaknesses before the HBL (High School Basketball League) season.</p>
            <p>Coach Gao Ding-Guo-Zhu talked about Quan Yi, a third-year point guard who is less than 170 cm tall, playing well. He said that last time against Nanhu, Quan Yi did not finish the game well enough. But today, in important moments, he handled the ball well. The coach sees that he has grown. "I expect a lot from him. I hope he can control the game on the court. Even if he is shorter, he must find a way to be better than others," the coach said.</p>
            <p>In this game, Xu En-Xiang, a second-year forward from Dongtai, scored the most points for his team with 22 points and also got 14 rebounds. Quan Yi had good all-around stats with 14 points, 5 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals. Xu En-Xiang said that he did not play well in the previous games. Today, he followed the coaches' advice and did not stop to think before shooting. Instead, he attacked the basket with confidence.</p>
