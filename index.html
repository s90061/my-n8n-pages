            <h1>Putin Criticizes US for Pressuring Russia's Trade Partners, Warns About Attacking Ukrainian Nuclear Plants</h1>
            <p>Russia's President Putin said today that Russia would act quickly if Europe seemed to be attacking it. He also criticized the United States for making countries like China and India stop buying energy from Russia. At the same time, he warned that Russia might attack nuclear power plants in Ukraine that are controlled by Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the war between Russia and Ukraine is the most deadly war in Europe since World War II. It has also caused the biggest disagreement between Russia and Western countries since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.</p>
            <p>Putin spoke today at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi, a resort city by the Black Sea. He said that Russian troops are moving forward along the entire battle line in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Putin also said, "All countries in NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) are fighting against us."</p>
            <p>He stated that NATO members are giving Ukraine information, weapons, and training. He added that if Europe challenges Russia, Russia will respond quickly.</p>
            <p>Putin said, "If anyone else wants to compete with us in military matters, as we say, let them try. Russia's response will come quickly."</p>
            <p>Putin also disagreed with former US President Donald Trump, who called Russia a "paper tiger." Putin said that Russia has the strongest army in the world. He also pointed out that if Russia is a paper tiger, then NATO is too. He suggested that if Western countries think they are facing a paper tiger, they should try to deal with it.</p>
            <p>Putin claimed that European leaders continue to create strong, worried feelings, which is almost leading to a war with Russians. But he said it was "unbelievable" to think that Russia would ever attack a NATO country.</p>
            <p>Putin said, "I really want to say: calm down, sleep well, and take care of your own problems."</p>
            <p>Today, Putin also criticized the United States for telling India and China to stop their energy trade with Russia. He warned that such actions could cause problems for the US.</p>
            <p>He said that if higher taxes are put on Russia's trade partners, it will make prices around the world go up. This would also force the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to keep interest rates high, which would then harm the US economy.</p>
            <p>Today, Putin also accused Ukraine of attacking areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is controlled by Russia. He warned that Russia might get revenge.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Putin answered questions about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. He said, "They have nuclear power plants that are still working there. Why shouldn't we do the same thing back? Let them think about that carefully."</p>
            <p>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the electricity grid for more than a week. Russia and Ukraine blame each other for this power cut.</p>
            <p>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has 6 reactors. Before the war, it provided about 1/5 of Ukraine's electricity. After Russia took control, all these reactors were shut down. However, the nuclear power plant still needs electricity to keep its cooling and safety systems working. This is important to prevent the reactors from melting down and causing a nuclear accident.</p>

            <h1>Elon Musk Says Netflix Promotes Transgender Ideas, Asks Followers to Cancel Subscriptions</h1>
            <p>Billionaire Elon Musk today accused Netflix, a streaming service, of promoting what he called "transgender ideas." He asked his 227 million followers on social media to stop paying for Netflix.</p>
            <p>Musk joined a protest started by the conservative social media account "Libs of TikTok." This is his latest action in a "culture war."</p>
            <p>Libs of TikTok called for people to stop using Netflix because of its animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park" and its company policy to have more diverse people working there.</p>
            <p>Hamish Steele, who created "Dead End: Paranormal Park," was criticized online. This happened because he wrote something on social media that some people thought was disrespectful about the stabbing of conservative internet celebrity Charlie Kirk in September.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Musk shared the post from Libs of TikTok on X, his social media platform. He wrote, "Cancel Netflix."</p>
            <p>That post showed a picture from a Netflix company report. The report said that Netflix has increased the number of non-white directors and main characters on its platform.</p>
            <p>Musk later sent out another post. He told his followers, "For your children's health, cancel Netflix."</p>
            <p>Steele himself wrote about this argument on the social media platform Bluesky, but that post has now been deleted. He wrote, "These are all lies and false statements!"</p>
            <p>Musk has a personal connection to transgender issues. His oldest daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, openly changed her gender in 2022. She also legally changed her name and gender identity.</p>
            <p>Musk has said that his children were "killed" by a "woke mind virus."</p>
