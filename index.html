            <h1>After the Landslide Dam Disaster, Rescue Work is Over; The Office Will Now Help with Recovery</h1>
            <p>The Hualien flood disaster happened almost a month ago. Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai said that when the disaster prevention work is finished, the Forward Coordination Office will change. It will become the "Central Coordination Meeting for Post-Ma Ta An River Landslide Dam Disaster Recovery and Rebuilding." Minister Chen Chin-te will take over the tasks for recovery and rebuilding.</p>
            <p>Government spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said at a press conference today that Premier Cho Jung-tai heard a report about the "Recovery after the Ma Ta An River Landslide Dam Disaster." He said that the first stage of disaster response is mostly done. So, after the typhoon prevention work, the Forward Coordination Office will become the "Central Coordination Meeting for Post-Ma Ta An River Landslide Dam Disaster Recovery and Rebuilding." Chen Chin-te will be the executive secretary. Advisor Lee Meng-yen and Director Hung Tsung-kai from the Executive Yuan's Eastern Taiwan Joint Services Center will be the deputy executive secretaries. They will continue the recovery and rebuilding work.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also warned about Typhoon Fengshen, which might form this weekend. He said they should "expect the worst and prepare carefully." The coordination office's chief coordinator, Chi Lien-cheng, will help the Hualien County Government. They will practice a large-scale evacuation drill on the 15th. This practice is like a real situation, and all government departments should help fully.</p>
            <p>Also, Chi Lien-cheng explained today through a video call that there are three stages for evacuating Guangfu Township for typhoon prevention. If needed, a landslide dam alarm will be used, like an air raid siren. This will tell people to move to higher ground. Also, to keep clear rules for evacuation, volunteers will not be allowed into the disaster area from the 18th.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan's disaster relief service station is now managed by the Eastern Taiwan Joint Services Center. Premier Cho said they must make sure relief money is given out correctly, safely, and quickly. If it's not clear who was affected, the responsible government departments should check carefully and help people. They must protect people's rights and help those affected get relief money soon.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare's Disaster Relief Foundation has collected nearly NT$1.2 billion in donations. Premier Cho thanked the public for caring about the disaster area. To help affected people return to normal life faster, he asked relevant departments and the foundation to quickly start emergency aid and home support programs. After checking that all information is correct and processes are complete, the money should be given to people as soon as possible.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Medical University Starts "Green Healthcare" to Lessen Dialysis and Carbon Footprint</h1>
            <p>In Taiwan, the number of people with kidney disease is expected to reach over 3 million in two years. The Taipei Medical University system is working on sustainable healthcare. Their first step is "Green Kidney Care" in the kidney department. This helps patients delay or even avoid dialysis. It also aims to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>"The best green care is for patients not to need dialysis," said Max Wu, President of Taipei Medical University, at a press conference today. He explained that a study by Taipei Medical University and the international INSIDE CKD project showed some things. In 2022, about 2.5 million people in Taiwan had long-term kidney disease. This is 10.6% of all people. But most patients did not know they had kidney problems until stage 4 of the disease.</p>
            <p>Wu said that by 2027, the number of patients is expected to grow to 3 million. The cost of care will also be very high, at NT$62.18 billion. The risk of other health problems and death will also greatly increase.</p>
            <p>He also explained the idea of "Green Kidney Medicine." In 2009, an Australian doctor suggested this idea. It means helping patients get better health and life quality through early diagnosis, slowing down the disease, and less dialysis. At the same time, it uses fewer medical resources and reduces harm to the environment.</p>
            <p>Wu stated that this idea fits well with President Lai Ching-te's "Healthy Taiwan" plan. The Taipei Medical University healthcare system uses this plan. Every year, it successfully helps about 50 patients avoid dialysis. Both the number of people starting dialysis and the death rate have gone down by 20%. This saves Taiwan's National Health Insurance over ten million New Taiwan Dollars each year.</p>
            <p>He used hemodialysis as an example. This treatment uses a lot of resources. Each patient needs over 74,000 liters of water and 1,963 kilowatt-hours of electricity every year. It also creates over 320 kilograms of waste.</p>
            <p>Wu Mei-yi, Vice President of Research and Development at Shuang Ho Hospital, shared some news. In recent years, Shuang Ho Hospital has started many green changes. They use digital systems and reuse dialysis wastewater and waste. Between 2023 and 2024, they reduced carbon dioxide by 2,508 tons. This is like the yearly carbon pollution from 2,200 gasoline cars. This is a very good result.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu, Director-General of the National Health Insurance Administration, spoke at the event. She said that recently, extreme weather has caused many disasters in Taiwan, especially in Guangfu Township, Hualien. This reminds the government that the healthcare system needs to be "strong." It must work well even during typhoons, floods, and other natural disasters.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu said that every time the Central Emergency Operation Center tells people to leave, they first ask, "Are there any pregnant women? Are there any dialysis patients?" If dialysis patients stop their treatment, it can be very dangerous for their lives.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu said that about 7% of dialysis patients in Taiwan use peritoneal dialysis. This is more than Japan's 3%, but it's less than other Asian countries. To help dialysis patients be more active, the number of people using peritoneal dialysis needs to increase. This will not only make Taiwan's healthcare stronger but also help with sustainable healthcare and reduce medical wastewater.</p>

            <h1>Shin Kong Life Starts Building T17, T18; Council Members Think It's to Pressure Taipei City Government and Demand an Explanation</h1>
            <p>People are watching to see if Nvidia can move into Taipei Science Park's T17 and T18 sites. Today, Shin Kong Life held a groundbreaking ceremony to start building. Taipei City Council members from both sides (blue and green parties) questioned Shin Kong Life's goal. They believe it is to pressure the city government. They asked if Shin Kong Life thought about how Nvidia feels. If the deal fails, the city government should explain quickly.</p>
            <p>Nvidia's plan to set up at Taipei Science Park's T17 and T18 sites is stuck because of land rights. Shin Kong Life held a groundbreaking ceremony at the park today. Lin Wei-chun, General Manager of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings, spoke to the media. He said that Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings always acts legally, follows rules, and keeps its promises. They always follow the law.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Council members from both the blue and green parties shared their opinions. Chen Hsien-wei, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) council member, said in a media group that citizens are tired of the "bad drama" between bad companies and a weak city government. This action also makes people think it's a "fake groundbreaking to really put pressure on."</p>
            <p>Chen Hsien-wei said that since the city government chose to talk, Shin Kong Life should quickly offer a plan for discussion. If Shin Kong Life is worried about breaking promises and the city government is worried about giving special favors, both sides should think about what the citizens need. Shin Kong Life should also face the fact that its company image is getting worse.</p>
            <p>Lin Yen-feng, another DPP council member, also said that acting on emotions cannot solve big problems. What should have been a good move might lead to everyone losing. Shin Kong Life's actions are making the city government look bad.</p>
            <p>Lin Yen-feng said that Shin Kong Life suddenly held the groundbreaking ceremony, but the city government knew nothing about it. This makes it hard for people to understand. It seems that the T17 and T18 deal might fail. If it does, the city government should explain clearly to the public early.</p>
            <p>Chien Shu-pei, a DPP council member, wrote on Facebook that Shin Kong Life's groundbreaking ceremony was not a normal way to start work. Shin Kong Life won the bid with a low price, but for three years, they just left the land empty. Even the city design review was only approved in June this year, and there were many changes. The Taipei City Construction Management Office said publicly that they have not received any documents from Shin Kong Life to report the start of work for T17 and T18 yet.</p>
            <p>She said that Shin Kong Life's groundbreaking ceremony was not reported, was against the rules, and was a fake political show. Also, Mayor Chiang Wan-an went to Tainan today to inspect something, but he did not stay in Taipei for this important matter. She questioned if he can lead the capital city's industrial growth.</p>
            <p>Hsu Hung-ting, a Kuomintang (KMT) council member, wrote on Facebook that this action is very low. He said he finally saw today a kind of old story he heard as a child but never believed. He thinks if they want to be good, they should talk properly and solve their problems. But they are making trouble without a good reason. In the end, it's just about "greed."</p>
            <p>Tseng Hsien-ying, another KMT council member, also posted on Facebook. He said Nvidia's chips are the best, but they cannot solve Taiwan's complex political and economic situation. He thinks the city government should cancel the contract with Shin Kong Life. Nvidia is stuck because of Taiwan's complex politics, economy, and laws. He asked, "Has anyone thought about how Nvidia feels?" He wants to know when Nvidia can rent the land and start building.</p>
