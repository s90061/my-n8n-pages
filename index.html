            <h1>US Government Shutdown Has No Solution Yet; Trump Says He Will Announce Program Cuts on October 17</h1>
            <p>The US federal government has been shut down for two weeks, and there is still no solution. US President Trump, who is a Republican, said today that the government is closing some programs started by the Democratic Party. He plans to announce a list of these closed programs on October 17. He mentioned that these programs include some that are "very bad, with socialist or half-communist ideas."</p>
            <p>Republicans want to pass a simple temporary bill to fund the government for seven weeks to stop the shutdown. Democrats, however, want to add rules to the bill, like extending health insurance tax help, to make sure important social policies do not stop when their funding ends. Because of this disagreement over the funding bill, the federal government shut down on October 1. Leaders from both parties blame each other for the shutdown.</p>
            <p>After two weeks of shutdown, reporters asked Trump at the White House if he felt a need to end the shutdown in the next one or two weeks. He replied, "We have gone through many, many government shutdowns, and this one should not have happened at all."</p>
            <p>He also said that Democrats have lost a lot during this shutdown. "We are closing those programs that belong to the Democratic Party, those programs we were against," and "we will not let them come back," he added.</p>
            <p>Trump said his government will release a list of the closed programs on October 17. This list will include "some very bad items, with socialist or semi-communist characteristics."</p>
            <p>During the government shutdown, Trump and his team have also fired many federal employees. News reports say that over 4,000 people have lost their jobs. This affects departments such as Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Treasury, Education, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.</p>
            <p>The last time the US government shut down was during Trump's first time as president. This happened because of problems with immigration. That shutdown lasted 35 days, from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. It was the longest government shutdown in US history.</p>

            <h1>UK and US Work Together to Fight Large Online Scams; Chinese Crime Leader Is Punished</h1>
            <p>The UK and US have joined forces to fight large-scale online scams around the world. Today, they announced punishments against big scam centers based in Southeast Asia. A total of 12 groups and individuals are on the list. All of them are connected to Chen Zhi, a main crime leader born in Fujian, China.</p>
            <p>The money and property of these people and groups will be frozen. This includes 19 expensive properties in London. The US government states that Chen Zhi's criminal network is one of the biggest in Asia.</p>
            <p>The British government plans to release a new plan to fight scams later this year. Next year, they will host a "Countering Illicit Finance Summit" in London.</p>
            <p>London is an important center for international money, and British territories overseas, like the Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands, have often been used to hide money. Because of this, people are paying more attention to whether the UK can do more to fight "dirty money" (illegal money).</p>
            <p>The UK Foreign Office said that the scam networks in Southeast Asia do not only steal money. They also force people from different countries to do scams by moving them illegally, threatening them, and treating them badly. People from the UK are also victims of these scams.</p>
            <p>According to the British government's records, Chen Zhi, the crime leader punished today, was born in 1987. He has citizenship from Vanuatu, Cambodia, and Cyprus. He owns companies like Prince Global Group and is a director in other companies, like Uni More Group. He is accused of running scams and cleaning illegal money in Cambodia through companies and online platforms such as Prince Global Group and Jin Bei Group.</p>
            <p>Chen Zhi and his partners set up companies in the British Virgin Islands and bought property in London. This includes a luxury house bought for 12 million British pounds (nearly 500 million New Taiwan Dollars) in 2019. In 2020, they bought an entire office building in London's financial area for 95 million British pounds. They also bought 17 apartments in good locations in London.</p>
            <p>Besides the London properties, companies linked to Chen Zhi, like Prince Global Group and Jin Bei Group, also own and run casinos and hotels in Cambodia and other places.</p>
            <p>Prince Global Group and Jin Bei Group have been added to the UK government's list of punished groups today. Golden Fortune Resorts World Company is also on the list.</p>
            <p>Even though Golden Fortune Resorts World Company has "Resorts World" in its name, it is actually a scam center located outside Phnom Penh. It was built by Uni More Group, a company under Prince Global Group, and was made to look like a "science and technology park." Uni More Group is also being punished today.</p>
            <p>Byex Exchange, an online money platform connected to Prince Global Group and Jin Bei Group, is also on the punishment list. The Cambodian property company, Cambodian Heng Xin Real Estate, is also listed because it is accused of helping to build and run the scam centers.</p>
            <p>Besides Chen Zhi, other individuals punished by the UK government today include Chhay Guy and Dara Ing from Cambodia, a man named Zhu, Lei Bo from China, and a man named Qiu, who was born in China and has passports from Hong Kong, Cambodia, and Cyprus.</p>
            <p>The UK government thinks that about 3.44 million adults in England and Wales were victims of scams in the 12 months up to March this year.</p>
            <p>Today, the US government also announced punishments against Chen Zhi and the people and groups connected to him. They have taken about 15 billion US dollars in Bitcoin. This Bitcoin was illegal money Chen Zhi and his partners made and used to clean money.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that the US Department of Justice said in its press release that Chen Zhi and his group used their "political power in several countries" to hide their crimes and gave money to officials. Chen Zhi started these international scams and money cleaning activities around 2015, and now his operations are in more than 30 countries.</p>

            <h1>Looking Back at Old Photos: The Hsu Tzu-chiang Case, a 21-Year Mistake in Justice</h1>
            <p>The Taiwanese TV show "Presumption of Innocence" is based on the Hsu Tzu-chiang case. This case is known as one of the most argued-about wrongful convictions in Taiwan's legal history. The story started on September 1, 1995, when a rich businessman named Huang Chun-shu was kidnapped and quickly killed. But the criminals kept calling for ransom money.</p>
            <p>The police caught Huang Chun-chi when he came to collect the ransom. Huang Chun-chi then told the police that Hsu Tzu-chiang and Chen Yi-lung were also involved in the crime. On October 22, Chen Yi-lung was arrested. He said that the main person behind the crime was Huang Chun-chi's older brother, Huang Ming-quan. However, Huang Ming-quan had already run away to Thailand and was killed by his enemies in December of that year.</p>
            <p>Hsu Tzu-chiang turned himself in on June 24, 1996, with his lawyer, and he always said he was not guilty. The case went through the courts for 21 years. Hsu Tzu-chiang was sentenced to death nine times and to life in prison two times. A total of 72 judges heard his case during this time.</p>
            <p>During these years, on July 23, 2004, the Council of Grand Justices made a decision called Interpretation No. 582. This decision clearly stated that a confession from only one accomplice is not enough to find someone guilty. This rule helped reduce the chance of people being found guilty just because someone else said they were involved.</p>
            <p>On September 1, 2015, in the ninth retrial of the case, Hsu Tzu-chiang was found not guilty for the first time. The Supreme Court rejected the prosecutor's appeal on October 13, 2016. This meant the case was finally closed, and Hsu Tzu-chiang was allowed to move freely again.</p>
            <p>Hsu Tzu-chiang was held in jail for a total of 5,624 days. In the end, he received 28.12 million New Taiwan Dollars as payment for being wrongly imprisoned. This is the second-highest amount ever given for wrongful imprisonment in Taiwan's legal history, with the Chiang Kuo-ching case being the highest.</p>
