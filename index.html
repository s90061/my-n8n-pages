            <h1>World's Top Golfer Scottie Scheffler Wins British Open for the First Time, Moving Closer to Career Grand Slam</h1>
            <p>American golf player Scottie Scheffler won the British Open for the first time today. He won by 4 strokes, which is his fourth major championship victory.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Scheffler, who is the world's number one player, shot a 68 in his final round today, which is 3 strokes under par. He did not shoot over 70 strokes in any of the four rounds. He finished with a total of 267 strokes, which is 17 strokes under par, to win the title.</p>
            <p>Scheffler has now won 10 times in a row when he was leading after 54 holes.</p>
            <p>Scheffler has been so dominant in the past two years that if he gets a birdie on the first hole, other players seem to lose hope.</p>
            <p>Scheffler is now the second world's number one golfer in history, after Tiger Woods, to win the British Open trophy. He has now won three major championships, moving him closer to completing a career Grand Slam.</p>
            <p>Harris English, also from the United States, shot a 66 in his final round today. He finished in second place with a total of 271 strokes, which is 13 strokes under par. (Translated by Tsai Chia-min / Edited by Ho Hung-ju) 1140721</p>

            <h1>Weather Agency Issues Heavy Rain Warning: Yilan, Hualien, Taitung, Pingtung, Matsu, Orchid Island, and Green Island on Alert</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Agency has issued a heavy rain warning. Because of a low-pressure area, there will likely be short periods of heavy rainfall. Today, Hualien County and Taitung County may have heavy rain or very heavy rain. Yilan, Pingtung, Matsu, Green Island, and Orchid Island may also have heavy rain.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Agency reminds people to be careful of lightning, strong winds, and rising river levels. People in low areas should watch out for floods. Due to several days of rain, people in mountain areas should be careful of landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides. (Edited by Ho Hung-ju) 1140721</p>

            <h1>Pope Criticizes "Savage" Gaza War and Calls for Peaceful Solution</h1>
            <p>Pope Leo XIV of the Roman Catholic Church strongly criticized the "savage" war in Gaza today and spoke strongly against "the misuse of force." This happened after the Israeli army attacked a Catholic church in the Gaza Strip a few days ago, which caused three deaths.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Pope Leo XIV said, "I ask again for this savage war to end immediately and for us to find peaceful ways to solve the conflict." He said this at the end of the Angelus prayer event at his summer home in Castel Gandolfo, near Rome.</p>
            <p>On July 18, the Pope talked to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He told him he was "very sad" about the Israeli airstrike on the Holy Family Church in Gaza City on the morning of July 17.</p>
            <p>Around 600 displaced people were staying in this church. Most of them were children, including dozens with special needs.</p>
            <p>Leo XIV said today, "Sadly, this action has made the ongoing military attacks on civilians and religious places in Gaza worse."</p>
            <p>"I repeat my call to the international community to follow humanitarian law, to protect civilians, and to strictly forbid collective punishment, misuse of force, and forcing people to move."</p>
            <p>The Pope also showed "understanding and care" for "my dear Christian brothers and sisters in the Middle East" who often feel "powerless" when facing difficult situations. (Translated by Ho Hung-ju / Edited by Tsai Chia-min) 1140721</p>
