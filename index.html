Time magazine announced its 2025 list of the 100 most influential companies globally on June 26, with TSMC making the cut as the only wafer foundry firm. AI chip giant Nvidia was not selected.

The list is divided into five categories: Innovators, Disruptors, Leaders, Titans, and Pioneers. TSMC is listed under the Titans category. Time magazine noted that TSMC is the world's largest chip manufacturer, producing the "brains" for devices like smartphones and data centers. Thanks to the continuous surge in demand for advanced AI chips produced by TSMC, the company's first-quarter 2025 financial results exceeded analysts' expectations.

These chips have drawn TSMC into the trade war between the United States and China. Facing pressure from the White House, TSMC pledged in March to invest US$100 billion in US chip manufacturing facilities, bringing its total US investment to US$165 billion. Overall, TSMC plans to build nine factories in countries such as Germany and Japan in 2025.

TSMC's foundry competitors, South Korea's Samsung and US-based Intel, did not make the list, nor did Nvidia. Other AI and semiconductor companies listed include Alibaba, ASML, ByteDance, DeepSeek, Huawei, Meta, OpenAI, and Scale AI.

Notably, China's Pop Mart, known for its globally popular "Labubu" dolls, also made the list of the 100 most influential companies. Time magazine stated that Pop Mart currently has 530 themed stores worldwide, and its revenue and profit in 2024 more than doubled compared to 2023.

**Hsiao Bi-khim's Visit to Czech Republic: Chinese Officials Reportedly Tailgated, Nearly Causing an Accident**

During Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim's visit to the Czech Republic in March of last year as Vice President-elect, she was reportedly followed by Chinese diplomatic personnel, nearly leading to a car accident. Sources familiar with the matter stated today that harassing and even intimidating foreign dignitaries through various means is a common tactic used by the Chinese government, and the international community is paying close attention to Hsiao's case. They urged both ruling and opposition parties to condemn China, demand punishment for those involved, and a public apology.

Hsiao Bi-khim began her three-day visit to the Czech Republic on March 18 last year, during which she met with figures including Czech Senate President Milo≈° Vystrƒçil. It was later revealed that during her visit, she was followed by Chinese diplomatic personnel, almost causing a car accident. The Czech Military Intelligence Service confirmed that Chinese intelligence units attempted to carry out disruptive actions against a protected person. Czech media further reported that this operation even included plans to collide with Hsiao Bi-khim's vehicle.

Sources familiar with the CCP's overseas violent tactics stated that harassing and even intimidating foreign dignitaries through various means is a common tactic used by the Chinese government, and all parties must be vigilant.

The sources pointed out that in 2023, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service revealed that the family members in Hong Kong of a Canadian Conservative Party federal Member of Parliament of Chinese descent, Michael Chong, who is currently Vice-Chair of the Canada-China Relations Special Committee, were targeted by Chinese intelligence units. These units attempted to coerce Chong into compliance through threats and inducements. The Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsequently declared Chinese diplomat Zhao Wei, based at the Chinese Consulate in Toronto, an "unwelcome person" and expelled him.

Sources stated that in 2024, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation warned that the CCP was attempting to discredit members of Congress who are firm on China and support Taiwan, including falsely claiming that these pro-Taiwan legislators received "bribes" from Taiwan.

The sources mentioned that regarding the alleged plot by the Chinese embassy in the Czech Republic to crash into Hsiao Bi-khim's vehicle, Jakub Janda, Director of the European Values Center for Security Policy (EVC), noted that this was an extremely rare intelligence harassment operation in Europe, and the behavior of the Chinese diplomatic personnel clearly violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

The sources stated that the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which includes 41 parliaments worldwide and 290 member legislators, also issued a statement: "If this plan had succeeded, it would have constituted state terrorism. Even if unsuccessful, such an act in itself crosses a line. A country willing to commit such blatant, politically motivated violence in another country is not a regime that respects international diplomatic norms."

The sources added that IPAC has called on all countries to condemn China's political violence, and this case has garnered significant international attention. Both ruling and opposition political parties should jointly propose condemnation of China and demand that China punish the relevant personnel and issue a public apology.

**Han Kuo-yu Criticizes Malicious Recalls as Political Struggle, Says "A Successful Major Recall Will Leave Taiwan's Democracy Empty"**

The "major recall" campaign has entered a fierce stage. Taoyuan legislator Wan Mei-ling held an anti-recall briefing session tonight, with Mayor Chang San-cheng, legislator Hsieh Lung-chieh, and Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu attending in succession. They emphasized that Wan has been working in the central government to secure development and welfare for Taoyuan and assist in promoting beneficial bills, yet she is being subjected to a malicious recall. They called this a political struggle, stating that "if the major recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be empty." They urged the public to vote "against" on July 26.

Han Kuo-yu jokingly said that today, the grandmasters of Wudang and Shaolin had come to support Wan Mei-ling, "Grandmaster Wudang is Chang San-cheng, and Grandmaster Shaolin is me," drawing continuous laughter from hundreds of supporters in the audience.

Han Kuo-yu stated that they just finished elections last year, and it feels like elections are starting again now, which is not democratic politics but a political struggle and is unreasonable. He praised Wan Mei-ling's constituent services, noting that everyone commends her. As a five-term city councilor and two-term legislator, despite her busy schedule with constant meetings, Wan Mei-ling's attendance rate is 100%, having secured over NT$55 billion in development funds for the locality. "She works so hard, and now there's a recall. Does it mean the more excellent you are, the more you get recalled? This goes against democracy."

Han Kuo-yu also said that sitting as the Legislative Yuan President, he knows which legislators are serious in their interpellations. He felt sad hearing the Democratic Progressive Party constantly shout "major recall, major success." He said if Taiwan's democracy is a wall that Taiwan has painstakingly built, now with the recall pushing, the wall is about to be destroyed.

Han Kuo-yu declared, "If the major recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be empty." Taiwan will no longer be able to boast about the preciousness of its democracy to the outside world. He urged everyone to vote, stating that not voting is equivalent to not supporting Wan Mei-ling.
