Many people are now growing plants inside their homes. This is called indoor gardening. It's become very popular because it's a fun hobby and it makes your home look nicer. You don't need a lot of space to start. You can grow herbs in your kitchen or flowers on a sunny windowsill.

Indoor gardening can also be good for your health. Plants clean the air and can make you feel happier. Some people grow vegetables indoors too, so they have fresh food to eat. If you are looking for a new hobby, maybe you should try indoor gardening. It's easy to learn and can bring a little bit of nature inside.

**Work: Flexible Work Options Are Becoming More Common**

More companies are letting people work in different ways. This means that some people can work from home, while others can choose when they start and finish work. This is called flexible work. It helps people balance their work and personal lives.

For example, a parent might need to work from home to take care of their children. Or someone might want to start work earlier so they can finish earlier and have more time in the afternoon. Companies are finding that flexible work can make employees happier and more productive. It's a change that's good for both workers and businesses.

**Travel: Sustainable Travel is Gaining Popularity**

When people travel, they are starting to think about the environment. Sustainable travel means travelling in a way that doesn't harm the planet. This could mean choosing to stay in eco-friendly hotels that save water and energy.

It also means using public transport instead of cars, or walking or cycling instead of driving. Some people are also choosing to visit places that need help, to support local communities. Sustainable travel is about being responsible and making choices that protect the Earth for future generations.
