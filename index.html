            <h1>Munich Stores Stop Selling Beer and Chips at Night; Student Protests Work</h1>
            <p>The government in Munich, Germany, recently started to strictly enforce a rule. This rule stops convenience stores in university areas from selling potato chips after 8 PM and bottled beer after 10 PM. This made students and store owners upset. Students protested, holding up beer and chips and shouting, "I love beer and potato chips!" Because of the arguments, the local government decided to pause the nighttime sales ban.</p>
            <p>Starting in August, the Munich government enforced the "Bavarian Business Hours Law" more strictly. This law said that five convenience stores near universities that stay open late could not sell potato chips after 8 PM and beer after 10 PM.</p>
            <p>Many university buildings in Germany are in different parts of the city, close to homes and shops. People living near the University of Munich (LMU) have often complained. They said students meeting at convenience stores after classes were too loud. They asked police to control this. But the strict rules caused strong negative reactions from businesses.</p>
            <p>Nechirvan Al Bezihi, a convenience store owner, said he has to cover his potato chip shelves with dark cloth after 8 PM. This is to stop customers from feeling "tempted" to ask for them. Another owner, Shivan Beseh, said he is very worried about his business. Most of his store's money comes from customers who buy drinks and snacks after 10 PM.</p>
            <p>Many students said the ban was not fair. They felt it pushed away young people who did not have enough money to go to bars often. They thought potato chips were better for hunger than candy and tasted better with beer. Convenience stores were usually cheap places for students to meet at night. They asked, "If even potato chips and beer are not allowed, where can we go?"</p>
            <p>Some students joined a protest organized by a small German political party called "Die Partei." This happened near the University of Munich, where the rules were strict. They held signs that said things like "Residents are annoying" and shouted, "Long live beer and potato chips!" to protest the nighttime ban. Marie Burneleit, a city council member from the party, even joked in the city council that the government was "making potato chips their most important task."</p>
            <p>The ruling party, CSU, defended the ban. City council member Thomas Schmid said that selling alcohol at convenience stores late at night was "the wrong way to do business." He thought that not only convenience stores but also some bars and restaurants should be responsible for the noise in the area.</p>
            <p>After people criticized the ban, the local government said that the nighttime ban was not a new rule. Instead, it was an old law that was being enforced strictly for the first time. According to the "Bavarian Business Hours Law," normal shops can only be open from 6 AM to 8 PM. Only restaurants, bakeries, and flower shops are allowed to stay open longer.</p>
            <p>In Munich, which is the biggest city in Bavaria, you often see convenience stores (called Kiosks) open late at night. For many years, these stores have been working in a gray area regarding business hours. Many German states, including Berlin, changed their rules years ago. They now allow convenience stores that sell drinks and snacks to stay open late at night.</p>
            <p>Because of the problems caused by the ban, Dominik Krause, Munich's deputy mayor, said on August 19 that they would pause the rule about convenience stores not selling beer and potato chips late at night.</p>
            <p>Krause said that young people often do not have much money and cannot afford to go to bars. So, cheap convenience stores are very important for people to meet and talk. He also said that the rights of people living nearby must be protected. He added, "Sidewalks cannot be full of broken glass, and people's doorsteps cannot be used as toilets." If problems with trash and noise continue to get worse, he said they would bring back the strict "nighttime beer and potato chip ban" at any time.</p>

            <h1>Israel Begins Attack on Gaza City, Controls Outer Areas</h1>
            <p>The Israeli army announced today that it has started the first steps to take over Gaza City. It has called up tens of thousands of extra soldiers to help with the full plan to capture Gaza City.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Effie Defrin, a spokesperson for the Israeli army, told reporters, "We have begun the first actions and the first part of attacks on Gaza City. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) now control the areas just outside Gaza City."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, approved the plan to take over Gaza City. He also gave permission to call up about 60,000 extra soldiers for this mission.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson confirmed Katz's decision to Agence France-Presse. This action puts more pressure on Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic group. At the same time, countries trying to help stop the war in Gaza, which has lasted almost two years, are waiting for Israel's official answer to their newest ideas for peace.</p>
