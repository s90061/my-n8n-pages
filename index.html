            <h1>Indian Air Force: 6 Pakistani Military Planes Shot Down During May Fight</h1>
            <p>New Delhi, August 9 â€“ India's Air Force chief, Mr. Singh, said today that during a fight with Pakistan in May, India shot down five of Pakistan's fighter jets and one military plane. This was the most serious military fight between these two countries in many years. This is the first time India has said this, months after the conflict happened.</p>
            <p>Mr. Singh said in a meeting in Bengaluru, a big city in southern India, that most of Pakistan's planes were shot down by Russia-made S-400 missiles. He showed electronic information to prove these hits. He said, "We have confirmed that at least five were shot down, plus one large plane."</p>
            <p>Mr. Singh explained that the large plane he mentioned might have been a spy plane. It was shot down from 300 kilometers away. He said, "This is actually the farthest known shot down by a ground-to-air missile ever." The people listening, including air force officers, retired military members, government workers, and business people, clapped loudly.</p>
            <p>Pakistan's military did not quickly respond to questions about this. Mr. Singh did not say which types of Pakistani fighter jets were shot down. But he did say that during the air attacks, India also hit a spy plane and "a few F-16 fighter jets" that were in hangars at two air force bases in southern Pakistan.</p>
            <p>These two nuclear-armed countries in South Asia had a military fight from May 7 to May 10. Pakistan's air force uses fighter jets from China and American F-16s. Before this, Pakistan had said that none of its planes were shot down in the fight. Pakistan also said that it had shot down six Indian planes, including a French-made Rafale fighter jet. India has said that it had some losses but denied losing six planes.</p>
