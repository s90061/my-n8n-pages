            <h1>US and Brazil Hold High-Level Talks; Trump Pushes Brazil to Drop BRICS Currency Idea</h1>
            <p>Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira will meet with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on October 16. They will have important talks about economic and political topics between the two countries. Brazil's Foreign Ministry sees this meeting as a key moment to restart discussions about tariffs (taxes on imported goods) and sanctions (official orders that limit trade or contacts with a country).</p>
            <p>According to the Brazilian news website g1, three other Brazilian representatives will join Vieira. These include Brazil's Ambassador to the US, Maria Luiza Viotti, chief negotiator MaurÃ­cio Lyrio, and diplomat Philip Fox-Drummond Gough, who works on economic matters. The Foreign Ministry has stated that they will use a careful and practical approach during these talks.</p>
            <p>The report mentions that US President Donald Trump met with Argentina's President Javier Milei at the White House on October 14. During this meeting, Trump announced that the US would offer Argentina up to $20 billion in currency swaps to help make its economy stable. He also clearly stated his opposition to the BRICS group's idea of creating a new currency to replace the US dollar.</p>
            <p>The BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has been working in recent years to reduce its reliance on the US dollar. At the BRICS summit in South Africa in 2023, Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva asked for a common currency. This currency would be used for trade and investments among member countries to lessen the impact of changes in the dollar's exchange rate.</p>
            <p>Russia, on its part, has proposed creating an independent financial payment system called "BRICS Bridge." This system would be a digital way to pay instead of using the dollar. This idea is still being discussed and is not yet a single currency or a clear plan to be put into action. Many experts believe that creating a common currency quickly is not realistic. This is because the BRICS member countries have very different economies and political situations.</p>
            <p>People close to the Brazilian government have said that President Lula has decided to stop promoting the idea of a new currency to replace the dollar. He made this decision based on advice from his team, aiming to avoid unnecessary disagreements with the US.</p>
            <p>Lula confirmed today that official talks between the US and Brazil will begin on October 16. He spoke about a phone call he had with Trump on October 6, which lasted about 30 minutes. He joked, "He said we have chemistry. I said it's not chemistry, it's petrochemicals." Lula also shared that they plan to talk in an informal way, stressing how important personal connections are.</p>
            <p>Brazil hopes to focus on economic topics during the talks. However, the Foreign Ministry believes that the US might be more interested in planning a formal meeting between Trump and Lula. The US might also bring up political issues related to Latin American countries like Venezuela and Cuba.</p>
            <p>The report also notes that Secretary Rubio's attitude now seems more subdued compared to before. Brazilian diplomats point out that he used to comment on Brazilian politics often on social media, but now he is taking a more careful approach.</p>

            <h1>US Media: China Increases Trade War to Get Trump's Attention</h1>
            <p>Trade tensions between the US and China are growing. This is happening before a possible meeting between the leaders of both countries in Korea. US media reports say that China thinks the problem is caused by hardline US officials who advise President Trump on China. These officials do not want relations between the two countries to improve. Chinaâ€™s actions are meant to get Trump's personal attention. American experts believe China might have misjudged the situation and reacted too strongly.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that many experts believe Chinaâ€™s new, stricter controls on exporting rare earth minerals are not just about managing these important natural resources. China also hopes that these big actions will make US President Donald Trump pay attention. They think his team is trying to stop US-China relations from getting better.</p>
            <p>China's strategy has had an effect. Trump has made trade between the US and China the main topic of international discussion. However, this has also worried governments and businesses in Europe, and it has impacted stock markets.</p>
            <p>Trump announced that next month, the US will put a 100% extra tax on products imported from China. In response, China added five US companies that belong to the Korean firm Hanwha Ocean to a list of companies it is targeting. Trump then threatened to stop buying Chinese cooking oil. Both countries are now charging high fees for each other's cargo ships entering their ports. On October 15, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also threatened to further limit US private businesses that export strategic (very important) goods from selling them abroad.</p>
            <p>Chinese experts believe that a decision made by the US Commerce Department on September 29 surprised Beijing. The US expanded its rules about foreign companies buying American industrial technology. These rules now cover not only companies already on a banned list but also their related businesses. China had believed that there was a break in the trade war after four rounds of talks and a phone call between the leaders.</p>
            <p>China's new ban on rare earth exports is like hitting Trump where it hurts most. It might also be a way for Chinese President Xi Jinping to show his strength to the Chinese people before an important meeting of the Communist Party.</p>
            <p>Wu Xinbo, the head of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, asked an important question: "If you are a country's leader who spoke with Trump on the phone, and then 10 days later the US publicly embarrasses you, how do you respond before an important political meeting in your country?"</p>
            <p>Experts who have contact with Chinese officials say that the US Commerce Departmentâ€™s actions against thousands of Chinese businesses were carried out by hardline China advisors within the Trump government. Beijing thinks Trump is busy with peace efforts in Gaza and the US government shutdown. So, they believe it is important to show him how these actions are affecting things. Experts also think China has already made some concessions (agreed to some demands) regarding TikTok. Wu Xinbo stated that Chinaâ€™s strong reaction is a reminder to Trump that he needs to handle the relationship personally and not allow hardliners to damage it.</p>
            <p>Sun Yun, who directs the China Program at the Stimson Center, a research group in Washington, believes that China misjudged the situation this time. Many countries were surprised by Chinaâ€™s ban and felt it was an excessive (too much) reaction.</p>
            <p>US experts point out that Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry understands it might have overreacted. It explained that the new rules for rare earth minerals will not be used widely, and they will not restrict everything. Beijing is too sure that Washington will remove its bans on China and that it can change the negative opinions of other countries.</p>
            <p>Evan Medeiros, a professor of East Asian studies at Georgetown University, thinks that using these kinds of methods to get Trump's attention is a bad idea. He compared it to simply waving to say hello, instead of putting on full armor and then promising not to use heavy weapons.</p>

            <h1>US Judge Orders to Stop White House from Firing Many Federal Workers During Government Shutdown</h1>
            <p>The US government shutdown has now entered its third week. Today, a federal judge made a temporary order. This order stops the Trump administration from firing thousands of federal government employees during the shutdown. The judge said that the Trump government's actions to cut jobs were against the law.</p>
            <p>US news channels, such as CNN and CNBC, reported that a US judge issued this temporary order today. This happened five days after the Trump government told more than 4,000 federal employees that they would lose their jobs.</p>
            <p>During a court meeting, Federal District Judge Susan Illston said, "The actions that are happening right now are against the law." She then issued the temporary order.</p>
            <p>Two labor unions, which represent tens of thousands of federal employees, asked the judge to prevent the Trump government from firing these workers. The Trump government had previously warned that it would cut jobs during the shutdown. US President Donald Trump also said many times that these job cuts would be aimed at "Democratic agencies" or programs.</p>
            <p>NBC News reported that Judge Illston stated that the Trump government "used the break in government spending and operations to think that all rules no longer applied. They thought laws no longer controlled them, and that they could change the government structure they did not like as they pleased."</p>
            <p>Illston also added that she believes the plaintiffs (the unions) can show that the Trump government's actions were illegal, went beyond its authority, and were "random and not based on good reasons."</p>
            <p>Skye Perryman, the CEO of "Democracy Forward," a group that supports the unions, said: "The President seems to believe that the government shutdown distracts people from his harmful and unlawful actions. However, the American people are holding him accountable, including through the courts."</p>
            <p>The US government shutdown has now reached its 15th day. Today, a bill that could have ended the shutdown by providing temporary money failed again in the federal Senate.</p>
            <p>The Republican Party wants to first pass a "clean" temporary funding bill. This bill would simply keep government spending at its current levels for seven weeks to prevent the government from stopping its work. However, the Democratic Party wants to include rules in the bill, such as extending tax credits for health insurance. This is to make sure that some important social programs do not stop when their funding runs out. But the two parties cannot agree on the spending bill. The federal government officially shut down on October 1. Leaders from both parties are blaming each other for causing this government shutdown.</p>
            <p>During the US government shutdown, Trump and his administration have recently fired many federal workers. According to US media reports, more than 4,000 people have lost their jobs. The government departments affected include Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Treasury, Education, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.</p>
            <p>Russ Vought, the Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said earlier today that the number of job cuts could "go above ten thousand people."</p>
