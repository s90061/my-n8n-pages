            <h1>Guangfu Township to Start Flu Vaccinations on October 1st; Landslide Dam Water Level Continues to Decrease</h1>
            <p>Hualien County, September 30 (CNA) The central disaster response center announced today that Guangfu Township will begin giving flu shots tomorrow, October 1st. Not only local residents but also volunteers will receive the vaccinations. The center also stated that the water level of the Matadaan River landslide dam continues to go down and is now stable.</p>
            <p>This morning, the central disaster response center held a press conference where different groups shared the latest updates. Lai Jian-xin, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs and the main coordinator, said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare is working with the Hualien County Health Bureau. The flu shots will be available for Guangfu Township residents, volunteers, and military personnel helping with disaster relief efforts. People helping from other groups can also get the vaccine.</p>
            <p>Guangfu Township residents who may have lost their ID cards or are not on the official list can still get their flu shots by providing their ID number for verification.</p>
            <p>Lai Jian-xin also mentioned that important services like water and electricity are still being supplied and restored. Regarding lunchbox deliveries, people can pick them up at certain spots. If anyone knows of elderly people living alone or others who need help, they are asked to deliver lunchboxes to them. The coordination office will make changes as needed to help more people with emergency lunchbox deliveries. In the future, local volunteer cooking groups will also help.</p>
            <p>Huang Qun-ce, who leads the Hualien branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, said that drones observed the Matadaan River landslide dam. At 7:40 AM today, the water level was 1020.5 meters. The lake covers 12.8 hectares, and it holds 5.95 million tons of water. This is less than yesterday's 6.1 million tons. The current water volume is 6.5% of the original amount. It has been confirmed that the landslide dam is still overflowing and not blocking the river again, which means it is now stable.</p>

            <h1>Shan Long Transportation Driver's Work Accident Payment Not Fully Paid; Ministry of Labor: Can Apply Again</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 30 (CNA) The Taiwan Association for Victims of Occupational Injuries protested in front of the Ministry of Labor today. They asked the Ministry to quickly pay the rest of the work accident death benefits to the family of a truck driver from Shan Long Transportation. The Ministry of Labor replied that the family can apply to the Labor Insurance Bureau. If the payment is approved, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will give a condolence payment.</p>
            <p>The association explained that Lu Zhi-wei, a truck driver for Shan Long Transportation, suffered a brainstem hemorrhage while delivering goods on March 31, 2017, and later died in May. During the legal process, the first judge agreed with the Ministry of Labor's report. This report said that Lu Zhi-wei's death was not due to overwork from a work accident, so the family lost the case. However, in the second trial, the High Court asked National Taiwan University Hospital to check again. They confirmed that his death was very much related to his job, and the family then won the case.</p>
            <p>After winning, the association applied to the Labor Insurance Bureau for the missing 10 months of work accident death benefits. (The family had already received 30 months of regular death benefits). But the Labor Insurance Bureau refused to pay. They said they needed a final decision from the third trial. The association asked the Ministry of Labor not to delay helping the family by waiting for a third trial. They suggested following the example of the RCA case, where payments were made after the first trial victory.</p>
            <p>The association said that the first investigation report was wrong. This caused the family to wait about 3000 days for justice. They told the Ministry of Labor not to support what employers say and to listen more to workers and their families.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor stated that the worker's family won the civil lawsuit for work accident compensation in the second trial. If the family has new proof, they can apply to the Labor Insurance Bureau. The Labor Insurance Bureau will check all the papers. If new proof is found, they will start the process again, following Article 128 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
            <p>For help to the worker's family, the Ministry of Labor will ask local experts who help with work accidents to offer their services. If the Labor Insurance Bureau later approves the death benefit for the work-related illness, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will give a condolence payment.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor also said that its agency for checking workplaces had investigated this case for possible overwork. The company was punished for breaking labor laws. During the investigation, they tried to find all possible facts. They talked to other drivers who had similar jobs and used information from the employer, the worker, and the family. Then they wrote a report.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor emphasized that the second trial judgment did not change the main facts that the workplace inspection agency found earlier. The only difference was that the medical opinion from the National Taiwan University Hospital, which the court asked for, was different from the medical opinion used at first to decide if it was a work-related illness. The Ministry stressed that they did not only use the employer's statements and ignore what the family said.</p>

            <h1>Memory Chip Prices Rise, Shares of Related Companies Go Up; ADATA Hits Daily Limit, Highest in Over 18 Years</h1>
            <p>Hsinchu, September 30 (CNA) Prices for memory chips are expected to keep going up. Because of this, the stock prices of memory companies, including ADATA, all rose sharply. ADATA's stock price went up to its daily limit of NT$157, which is the highest it has been in over 18 years and 8 months. Apacer's stock price reached NT$72.8, the highest in more than 17 months.</p>
            <p>TrendForce, a market research company, believes that in the fourth quarter, prices for both DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and NAND Flash (storage memory) will increase. For regular DRAM, prices are expected to rise by about 8% to 13% in the fourth quarter. If high-bandwidth memory (HBM) is included, the increase could be even more, from 13% to 18%.</p>
            <p>For NAND Flash, TrendForce expects that all types of contract prices will go up. On average, prices will increase by about 5% to 10% in the fourth quarter. This is happening because many urgent orders for large SSDs (solid-state drives) for businesses have come in, making the market change a lot.</p>
            <p>As memory prices continue to climb, memory companies are expected to earn more money. This has made the stock prices of companies like ADATA go up significantly. ADATA's stock price reached its daily limit of NT$157, which is a new high since January 2007. Apacer's stock price reached NT$72.8, which is its highest price since mid-April last year.</p>
            <p>Nanya Technology's stock price went up to NT$75, an increase of 5.63%. Phison's stock price reached NT$695, up by 8.25%. Winbond's stock price went up to NT$34.15, an increase of 8.75%.</p>
