            <h1>UMC Asks Suppliers to Lower Prices by More Than 15% Next Year; Material Companies May Be Most Affected</h1>
            <p>It is being said that UMC, a company that makes computer chips, has asked its suppliers to lower their prices by more than 15% starting next year. UMC did not say anything about this news.</p>
            <p>People who watch the market think that companies which supply silicon wafers, masks, special gases, and materials for polishing will be the most affected. UMC's goal is to make its costs lower. This will help them keep their strong position in the market and also help their suppliers in the long run.</p>
            <p>UMC did not comment on the news about asking suppliers for lower prices. The company said that the business situation in the third quarter is as they expected and is not getting worse. They have not yet talked about how business will be next year. UMC previously thought that they would send out 1% to 3% more chips in the third quarter. They also expected the average price of their products in US dollars to stay the same.</p>
            <p>People in the market believe that large international equipment companies have not yet received a request from UMC to lower prices. The companies that will mainly be affected are those that supply silicon wafers, masks, special gases, chemicals, and polishing materials. However, there is still one to two months for these companies to prepare. We need to wait and see how UMC's suppliers will manage this change.</p>
            <p>Investors are worried that the computer chip industry might face challenges next year, and UMC could be under pressure. Today, UMC's stock price started higher but then went down. During the day, it went from positive to negative, reaching 43.35 New Taiwan Dollars. This was a drop of 0.9 New Taiwan Dollars, more than 2%.</p>

            <h1>Marine National Park Headquarters Cleans Up Southern Four Islands, Makes Coasts Clean Again</h1>
            <p>The Marine National Park Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior held a special beach cleanup event for three days this autumn. They cleaned the Southern Four Islands of Penghu. During the cleanup, they collected 305 kilograms of trash that had washed ashore. Trained volunteers who are part of a special team helped by rappelling down cliffs to remove trash. This work made the coasts clean again.</p>
            <p>The Marine National Park Headquarters announced that their "Salute to the Sea - Autumn Typhoon Special Cleanup Action" took place from September 29 to October 1. About 70 people joined in the cleanup on Dongjiyu Island. These people included members from the Taiwan Promise Public Welfare Association, Tainan City Jiangjun Elementary School, the Seventh Special Police Corps Southern Four Islands Team, Dongji Security Inspection Station, local volunteers, and staff from the Marine National Park Headquarters.</p>
            <p>The Headquarters said that Typhoon Kagasa caused strong winds and heavy rain in the Southern Four Islands of Penghu. A lot of trash from the sea gathered on the island's coasts and on the sides of cliffs. Many people helped with this cleanup after the typhoon. They cleared away old fishing nets, buoys, styrofoam, plastic bags, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and glass bottles. In total, they collected 305 kilograms of trash. Most of the trash was plastic bottles, and 54% of these bottles came from China.</p>
            <p>The Marine National Park Headquarters also said that some of the trash on Dongjiyu Island in the Southern Four Islands was stuck in the basalt cliffs. These cliffs are very steep, so it was hard for people to reach the trash in the usual way. Luckily, the trained special team volunteers helped. They used ropes to go down the cliffs and remove the trash even in the hot weather. Because of their help, the beautiful cliffs and sea view are now clean again.</p>
