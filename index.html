Former US President Donald Trump announced today that the US and Vietnam have a new trade agreement. Under this deal, goods from Vietnam sent to the US will have a 20% tax. Goods that are just sent through Vietnam from places like China will have a 40% tax.

Trump said on social media that Vietnam also agreed to remove all taxes on goods coming from the US. The 40% tax will be for products that are partly made in China or other countries, then finished in Vietnam, and then sent to the US. The US has not yet said which specific goods will have this 40% tax.

Trump talked about this agreement after speaking with Vietnam's leader. He said this means Vietnam will "open its market to the US," allowing US products to be sold in Vietnam without taxes. Vietnam is an important partner for the US in Asia. Also, many everyday items for US shoppers come from Vietnam.

In recent years, many companies have moved their factories from China to Vietnam. This has caused a big increase in exports from Vietnam to the US. Vietnam is a major supplier of clothes and sports items for brands like Nike and Lululemon. Last year, Vietnam was the 6th biggest supplier of imports to the US, sending nearly $137 billion worth of goods.

After Trump's announcement, shares of furniture and clothing companies went up. ON Holding, Nike, and Lululemon saw their stock prices rise. Last year, Vietnam had the third largest trade surplus with the US, after China and Mexico. In May, exports from Vietnam grew by 35%.
