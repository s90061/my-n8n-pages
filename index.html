            <h1>Israeli Army Speeds Up Clearing Gaza City, Over 65,000 Palestinians Dead in Two Years of Conflict</h1>
            <p>The Israeli army said today that they will open a new road for 48 hours. This road will help Palestinians leave Gaza City. Israel is also working faster to get civilians out of the city and to fight thousands of Hamas soldiers.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are now hiding in Gaza City. Many people do not want to go south as Israel told them. This is because the journey is dangerous, conditions in the south are bad, there is not enough food, and they are worried they will never return home.</p>
            <p>Ahmed, who teaches at a local school, spoke on the phone. He said, "Even if we want to leave Gaza City, how can we be sure we can come back? Will the war end? That is why I would rather die in Sabra. This is my own neighborhood."</p>
            <p>Health officials in Gaza said that Israel's air attacks and shootings today killed at least 50 people across the Gaza Strip. 39 of these people were in Gaza City.</p>
            <p>Officials said that with these new deaths, more than 65,000 Palestinians have now died in the two years of war between Israel and Hamas.</p>
            <p>Palestinian officials and rescue workers said the actual number of dead people might be even higher. Many bodies are still buried under the broken buildings.</p>
