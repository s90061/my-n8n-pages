            <h1>Disaster Recovery Work Can Cause Aches; Doctors Advise Not to Ignore Muscle Care</h1>
            <p>Recently, southern Taiwan has had strong winds and floods. Doctors have seen that many people who are helping with disaster recovery work feel sore or even get hurt. Doctors say that people should rest and see a doctor if needed. Also, they should exercise their muscles regularly to avoid getting "sarcopenia," which is when you lose muscle.</p>
            <p>Today, Chi Mei Hospital held an event called "Exercise to Build Muscle, Dads Stay Strong!" in their main hall. They had a special area where expert trainers and dietitians gave advice to people. They also taught people how to use elastic bands to make their muscles stronger.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo Hsing-dao, the vice president of Chi Mei Hospital, spoke at the event. He said that after the recent winds and floods, many people were busy helping with rescue efforts and cleaning up. Many volunteers and workers went into the affected areas. During this hard work, some people got muscle aches, and many also got injured.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo Hsing-dao said that fathers, especially, are very important to their families. Many fathers might not exercise or take care of their bodies often. So, when they suddenly have to do a lot more physical work, they can get tired easily. He hopes this event will help everyone pay more attention to keeping their muscles strong by exercising and eating well to prepare or get better.</p>
            <p>Dr. Su Chiung-jui, a doctor in the Rehabilitation Department at Chi Mei Hospital, said that people start losing muscle after age 30. They lose about 3% to 8% every 10 years. After age 70, this loss can happen even faster. This is called "sarcopenia." It not only makes you feel less strong but also affects how you walk and balance. It can also make it more likely for you to fall, break bones, and become unable to do things. A survey by the Health Promotion Administration shows that more than 34% of people over 65 years old have sarcopenia.</p>
            <p>Dr. Su Chiung-jui said that sarcopenia can be stopped or even improved. With the right exercise and food, people can get better. Studies show that if older people do muscle-strengthening exercises at least twice a week and eat enough protein, they can keep their muscles strong and move better. Using elastic bands for exercise is safe, easy to start, and can really help your core muscles. It's a very good way to begin exercising.</p>
            <p>He added that some patients he sees have worked for many years lifting heavy things. This has caused them to get injuries, so they are afraid to exercise. As a result, their muscles get weaker and weaker. Doctors can use ultrasound to find the injured areas. After treating and fixing the injured parts, patients can go to the exercise center to build muscle. This helps them get better and slowly return to their normal lives. He advises people with similar problems to see a doctor early.</p>

            <h1>People's Party Two-Year Rule Attracts Attention; Huang Shan-shan Supports Alternate Legislators Who Are Ready to Act</h1>
            <p>Today, People's Party legislator Huang Shan-shan said that Wang An-hsiang, who is the dean of the College of Social Sciences at National Chung Cheng University and on the party's list of people for the legislature, has been part of her office meetings. She said that even though Wang might be new to politics, he is not new to the work and is ready to "hit the ground running" in the legislature. People think that Huang Shan-shan's words mean she supports the People's Party's rule about two-year terms for some legislators.</p>
            <p>The People's Party will hold a meeting on August 10th. People are watching to see if they will change the "two-year rule" for certain legislators. However, Huang Kuo-chang, the head of the People's Party, said that he will not change the system that the former party head, Ko Wen-je, set up. For the People's Party, it's not just about growing the party, but also about keeping promises and doing what they say they will do.</p>
            <p>Today, Huang Shan-shan wrote on Facebook that it is the birthday of both the People's Party and Ko Wen-je. Six years ago today, Ko Wen-je started the party with the ideas of being "reasonable, practical, and scientific." He brought people together and has followed these ideas since then. Ko Wen-je also said to believe that "the wisdom of many people is greater than the wisdom of one person," and "one person walks fast, but a group of people walks far." Whether it was when he was mayor of Taipei City or now in the legislature, the People's Party has always followed these beliefs.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan pointed out that the list of people chosen to be legislators for the party shows how many different kinds of people are involved. They have different professional backgrounds, such as "medicine and nursing, labor relations, news media, politics and law, and experienced politicians." These people, who come from different areas, have been part of policy discussions for more than a year. This has allowed the People's Party to form a very strong team that can work beyond the usual political groups. They can oversee the government and protect the public good.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan said that before she started her term on February 1st last year, the People's Party already had a good system in place. Wang An-hsiang has been attending her office's weekly work and law meetings for more than a year. He is also in her office's work group and takes part in daily updates and legislative procedures in the legislature. He has also given ideas on many topics and changes to laws. She said that Wang An-hsiang has worked hard to learn about the finance committee's work to make sure that his future work in lawmaking and helping local communities will go smoothly.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan said that the legislature recently held a meeting about tariffs between Taiwan and the US. Wang An-hsiang gave ideas and solutions from the viewpoint of industries and workers. Wang An-hsiang might be new to politics, but he is certainly not new to the work. He is ready to "hit the ground running" in the legislature.</p>
            <p>Also, Huang Shan-shan said that in March, a judge asked her to be a witness because Ko Wen-je requested it. Because of this, she has not been able to listen in on court hearings for the past few months. Tomorrow afternoon, she will go to court to testify for Ko Wen-je. She will tell the truth to help the court find out what really happened.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan said she thanks Huang Kuo-chang for leading the People's Party to continue moving forward bravely and firmly. She believes that the dark times will end, and the truth will come out. The great work done by the Taipei City Government during its 8 years in power cannot be forgotten. She added, "Brother Ko, we are all here, waiting for you to return."</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Tries Electric-Assist Dispatch Vehicles to Improve YouBike "Tidal" Problem at NTU</h1>
            <p>To fix the problem at National Taiwan University (NTU) where YouBike stations often have no bikes to rent or no empty spots to return bikes, like the changing tides, Taipei City has started a new project. Starting today, they are trying out "electric-assist micro-dispatch vehicles." These vehicles are expected to move more than 400 YouBike bicycles each day.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Department of Transportation said that NTU is the only university in Taipei City with YouBike stations on its campus. And many people use them there. The campus has 59 stations, and over 15,000 bikes are rented each day. This is about 6% of all YouBike rentals in the entire city.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation explained that because students have regular class times, YouBike stations on campus often run out of bikes or empty spots during certain hours. To solve this, they worked with the university and the YouBike company to create the electric-assist micro-dispatch vehicles. These vehicles are more flexible than trucks and are good for the environment. They started testing them today.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ho Yu-jen, the general manager of the YouBike company, said at a press conference that NTU already had 4 trucks and 40 staff members to move bikes around the campus. But it still wasn't enough. So, to meet the university's needs, they specially developed the electric-assist dispatch vehicle that can carry 7 YouBike bicycles at once. They also hired more part-time workers. They hope this will help meet students' needs.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ho Yu-jen said that they plan to test the electric-assist dispatch vehicles for about six months. They are starting with 2 vehicles. During this time, they will watch how they work and make improvements. Then, they will decide if they need to add more vehicles.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsieh Ming-hung, the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation, said that the 2 electric-assist dispatch vehicles are expected to move an extra 400 to 500 YouBike bicycles daily. This will definitely make moving bikes more efficient compared to only using trucks. He hopes that when school starts, students will have an even more convenient service.</p>
            <p>NTU said that YouBike has become an important green way to get around for people all over Taiwan. They thanked the city government for its help. They believe that the electric-assist dispatch vehicles, which are more flexible, safer, and better for the environment than trucks, will be a good solution for the YouBike problem on campus. They also hope to keep working with the city government to make things even better in the future.</p>
