            <h1>ASEAN Economic News: Updates for September 15, 2025</h1>
            <p>Here are some economic updates from Southeast Asian countries.</p>

            <h3>Vietnam: Vietnam plans to improve its stock market for raising money and connecting with other countries.</h3>
            <p>Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh recently approved a plan to upgrade the securities market.

            <h3>Singapore: Singapore Post starts new mail service for US, due to new import rules.</h3>

            <h3>Philippines: Japanese companies promise 27 billion NTD investment in Philippines, including Mitsui & Co. and Marubeni.</h3>
            <p>According to Cristina Roque, the Secretary of Trade and Industry in the Philippines, a Philippine group visited Osaka, Japan, last week.

            <h3>Myanmar: Myanmar wants to attract Chinese money, plans to let investors use Chinese Yuan.</h3>
            <p>Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of Myanmar's military government, announced that Myanmar will quickly move to allow China to invest using the Chinese currency, RMB.</p>
            <p>Min Aung Hlaing said that many Chinese investors prefer to use RMB. Myanmar already uses RMB and Myanmar Kyat for some trade payments. Allowing investments in RMB and US dollars in Myanmar will help create more chances and improve the country's economy. Min Aung Hlaing asked all government departments to focus on attracting investments and to create a Myanmar-China Trade and Investment Association.</p>

            <h3>Malaysia: OCBC Bank Malaysia plans to spend 72 million NTD each year to train AI talent.</h3>
            <p>OCBC Bank Malaysia will invest over 10 million Malaysian Ringgit (about 72 million New Taiwan Dollars) each year.

            <p>Starting next year, OCBC Malaysia will also offer two scholarships. These scholarships are for students who study AI-related subjects. This is to help the country train its own AI talent.</p>

            <h3>Thailand: Phuket aims for 550 billion Thai Baht from tourism during the busy season, hoping to return to pre-pandemic success.</h3>
            <p>Phuket has set a goal of 550 billion Thai Baht in tourism money for the coming busy season. This is because early signs show that tourism is getting strong again, almost back to the level of 2019 before the pandemic.</p>
            <p>The head of the Phuket Tourist Association said that the general outlook for tourism is good. He pointed out that more direct international flights, including possibly more flights from China, are good signs for tourism getting better by the end of the year.</p>

            <h3>Indonesia: After cabinet changes, 869 million US dollars of money leaves Indonesia.</h3>
            <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto changed his cabinet, which included replacing the Minister of Finance. After this, a lot of foreign money left Indonesia's financial markets. In just 3 days, 14.24 trillion Indonesian Rupiah (about 869 million US dollars) flowed out. Indonesian Rupiah securities and government bonds were the most affected.</p>
            <p>Experts think that a change in leaders might mean a possible change in government plans. However, if the government can clearly explain its plans, the recent outflow of money might only be a short-term reaction.</p>

            <h1>Drug Coffee Packet Factory Found in Central Taiwan; Suspect Tries to Hide Drugs in Cemetery</h1>
            <p>The Central Taiwan Crime Fighting Center of the Criminal Investigation Bureau announced today that they busted a factory making drug coffee packets. The police said that one suspect quickly threw the drugs into a public cemetery in Changhua when police stopped him. He then left his car and ran away. However, the police still caught him and took a lot of drugs. He has been sent to the Changhua District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
            <p>Today, the Central Taiwan Crime Fighting Center of the Criminal Investigation Bureau held a press conference. They explained that they got information about an illegal group making and selling "Level 3" drug coffee packets in Yuanlin Township, Changhua County. A special team was then formed with the Yuanlin Precinct of the Changhua County Police Bureau and the Sixth Precinct of the Taichung City Police Bureau. They also asked the Changhua District Prosecutor's Office for permission to lead the investigation.</p>
            <p>The police said that the special team found the place where the drug coffee packets were made. On October 14 last year, they raided a quiet traditional house in Yuanlin Township, Changhua County. There, they first caught the main suspect, a man named Chang, at the drug packaging factory.</p>
            <p>The police found that another main suspect, a man named Hsu, ran away with finished drug coffee packets. When the police tried to stop him, he drove away very fast. He threw the drug coffee packets into a public cemetery in Yongjing Township, Changhua County, and then left his car and ran away. The police kept looking for him and found him on November 13 last year at his rented home in Qingshui District, Taichung City, where he was arrested.</p>
            <p>After a long investigation, the police found that the drug-making group was led by the suspect Chang. They rented a traditional country house to make the drug coffee packets. Then, they gave the drugs to the suspect Hsu to transport and sell for money. The special team seized 2,398 drug coffee packets, two large bags of drug pills, and one bag of drug raw material, cathinone (weighing 269.62 grams), as evidence.</p>
            <p>The police said that after the investigation, the entire case was sent to the Changhua District Prosecutor's Office based on charges related to the Narcotics Hazard Prevention Act. The District Prosecutor's Office finished its investigation. Both suspects, Chang and Hsu, were charged with drug crimes under the Narcotics Hazard Prevention Act in August this year.</p>

Liang Hsiu-shen said, "One winner works in front of the camera, and the other works behind the scenes. Both are 80 years old and are still working. They are great examples for us to follow. They also quietly help younger people without keeping their knowledge to themselves. Chen Shu-fang even worked for less money on projects by students and young directors. She did this to encourage and help them stay in Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Chen Shu-fang has been an actress for over 60 years. She has acted in many different types of performances, such as movies, TV shows, Taiwanese opera, and stage plays.

Her professional and dedicated spirit is a great example for the Taiwanese drama industry.</p>
            <p>About winning the Golden Bell Special Contribution Award, Chen Shu-fang said through her agent, "This honor is not just for me. It is also for all the viewers who have supported Taiwan's TV and drama over the years. Giving my whole life to the acting I love most is the happiest thing for me."</p>
            <p>This year is the 60th anniversary of the Golden Bell Awards. All the people who work in front of and behind the cameras are very important. The other winner of the Golden Bell Special Contribution Award is Yeh Hui-lung, a TV set designer. He is a great example of someone who works hard behind the scenes. His traditional handcraft skills and spirit are even more valuable now, in the age of digital technology. He is still working today and is happy to share his skills with younger people.</p>
