            <h1>Israel's Airstrike on Qatar Condemned by Many Western Countries; Canada to Review Relationship</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Israel attacked the capital city of Qatar, Doha, with airstrikes. These attacks targeted leaders of Hamas. Because of this, many Western countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, as well as the European Union, have criticized Israel. Today, Canada said it will look at its relationship with Israel.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Anita Anand, who is Canada's Foreign Minister, spoke to reporters. This happened during a meeting of the Liberal Party, which is the party in power.</p>
            <p>Anand told reporters, "We are looking at our relationship with Israel." She also said again that Canada believes Israel's attacks are not acceptable. This is especially true because Qatar is trying to help bring peace to the Middle East.</p>
            <p>Reporters also asked if Canada would think about putting any kind of punishments on Israel. Anand replied, "We will continue to decide what to do next."</p>
            <p>Today, Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, announced new plans. These plans are to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's full invasion. She also asked for limits on trade and punishments for Israel because of the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Regarding Israel's attack, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that this attack went against Qatar's right to govern itself. He also said it could make the situation in the region "even worse."</p>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron clearly stated that Israel's actions are "not acceptable," no matter what Israel's reasons are.</p>
            <p>Johann Wadephul, the German Foreign Minister, said in a statement: "Israel's attack on Doha not only went against Qatar's right to rule its own land, but it also put at risk all our efforts to get the hostages released. This attack cannot be accepted."</p>

            <h1>NASA Bans Chinese Citizens from Space Programs; US-China Space Rivalry Intensifies</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg reported that people familiar with the situation said the US space agency, NASA, has stopped Chinese citizens who hold US visas from being part of its programs.</p>
            <p>NASA has always had some rules about hiring Chinese citizens. However, in the past, Chinese citizens with US visas could still help with NASA's research. They could work as outside helpers, graduate students, or university scientists.</p>
            <p>The sources said that since September 5, Chinese citizens who used to work at NASA have not been allowed to access the agency's data systems. They also cannot join meetings related to their work, whether in person or online.</p>
            <p>Bethany Stevens, a spokesperson for NASA, confirmed the steps the agency has taken. Stevens said: "NASA has taken internal actions regarding Chinese citizens. This includes limiting their access to our buildings, data, and computer networks. This is to keep our work safe."</p>
            <p>Both China and the United States plan to send people to the moon in the next five years.</p>
