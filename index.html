            <h1>Chinese Leader of Cambodia Fraud Group, Chen Zhi, Visited Taiwan At Least 10 Times</h1>
            <p>The UK and the US are working together to fight against online fraud and money laundering across countries. On October 14, they announced punishments for a large criminal group based in Cambodia. Chen Zhi, who is from Fujian, China, is the leader of this group. He lived in Taiwan before and visited Taiwan at least 10 times.</p>
            <p>On October 14, the UK government punished six people and six companies connected to Chen Zhi. The US government punished almost 150 people and companies. This list includes three Taiwanese people and nine companies registered in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>According to US court documents, Chen Zhi has many citizenships, including Cambodian. He has lived in Singapore, Taiwan, and the UK. A US Department of Justice press release on October 14 said Chen Zhi was a UK and Cambodian citizen. However, the UK government's list of punishments does not say he is a UK citizen.</p>
            <p>Today, Central News Agency checked with the UK government and confirmed that Chen Zhi is not a UK citizen. The US Department of Justice has removed "UK national" from its press release. But, it is known that Chen Zhi did live in Taiwan and visited Taiwan at least 10 times.</p>
            <p>Chen Zhi and his partners started many companies in places like the Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, which are British territories. He also bought 19 expensive properties in London. For example, in 2019, he bought a large house with a pool and a cinema for 12 million British Pounds (about 500 million New Taiwan Dollars). In 2020, he bought a whole office building in London for about 95 million British Pounds.</p>
            <p>The UK government plans to release a new plan to fight fraud later this year. Next year, they will hold a "Countering Illegal Finance Summit" in London. British territories overseas and London's financial center will be important topics at this meeting because of their special role in money movement across borders.</p>
            <p>The UK government will announce the list of countries and other details about the summit later, as usual.</p>

            <h1>ESPN: Russell Westbrook Joins Kings for His 18th NBA Season</h1>
            <p>Russell Westbrook, a star basketball player in the NBA, has agreed to sign with the Sacramento Kings. His agent told ESPN, a sports news company, about this. People who know about the deal say he will officially join the team later this week.</p>
            <p>ESPN reported that Westbrook stayed in touch with the Kings during the time off between seasons. He waited patiently in the market where players can choose new teams. Finally, he made a deal with the Kings to play his 18th season in the NBA.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Westbrook is good friends with some Kings players like Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Zach LaVine.</p>
            <p>Westbrook will turn 37 in November. He has been chosen for the NBA All-Star team nine times. He was the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2017. He also holds the record for the most triple-doubles in NBA history with 203.</p>
            <p>Also, Westbrook and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers are the only two players in NBA history to have at least 25,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, and 8,000 assists.</p>
            <p>Westbrook has scored 26,205 points in his career. If he scores 506 more points, he will pass the famous player Oscar Robertson. Then, he will be the point guard with the most points in NBA history.</p>
            <p>For total assists in the NBA, Westbrook is in 8th place. He needs 75 more assists to become the 8th player in the league's history to have 10,000 career assists.</p>
            <p>Westbrook is an experienced player in the NBA. In the last three seasons, he played in 216 games. He started 145 of those games as a substitute. But each season, he was in the top 10 for the "Sixth Man of the Year" award.</p>
            <p>Last season, Westbrook played 75 games for the Denver Nuggets, starting 36 of them. He averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.4 steals per game. His shooting accuracy was 44.9%. In the 2024-25 season, his accuracy for two-point shots was 52%, which is the best in his career for one season.</p>
            <p>Westbrook joining the Kings will give them more players who can play in the backcourt, which they need. He can play as a starter or come off the bench. Last season, the Kings' substitute players scored the 28th fewest points in the league. Their substitute players also had the 29th fewest assists. His experience might help the team play better.</p>

            <h1>Su Po-ya Wins 5th Straight National Games Title, Warms Up for World Taekwondo Championships</h1>
            <p>Today, taekwondo athlete Su Po-ya won her fifth straight title in the women's 53kg category at the National Games. She said she was not in her best shape and had to use her strong will to keep going. After winning the gold medal, her next goal is the upcoming World Championships.</p>
            <p>Su Po-ya has won the women's 53kg taekwondo event at the National Games for four times in a row. This time, she showed her strength again. In the first round, she beat Huang Shih-hui and Chen Yi-tzu. Then, she moved on to the semi-finals. After that, she beat Chiang Yi-shan, who had just won a gold medal at the Swiss Open, with a score of 2-0. This brought her to the final match, moving closer to keeping her title.</p>
            <p>In the final match, Su Po-ya faced her old opponent Kuo Yi-fan. After the first two rounds, the score was 1-1. In the third and final round, both fought hard. Surprisingly, just before the end, Su Po-ya was hit in the middle part of her body and fell behind. It looked like she would lose the gold medal. But at an important moment, Su Po-ya scored with an upper body attack. She made an amazing comeback win, holding onto her title for the fifth time with a close score of 8-7.</p>
            <p>After the match, Su Po-ya told reporters that she did not feel as ready as usual. She said she had to slowly get better during each match, use her strong will, and talk about plans with her coach to fight until the very end. She felt like she overcame one difficulty after another.</p>
            <p>After winning her fifth straight National Games title, Su Po-ya will now focus on the World Taekwondo Championships. This event will be held in Wuxi, China, in late October. She has competed in the World Championships four times before but has never won a medal. Su Po-ya said, "I don't have any special goals. I just need to do my best in each match."</p>
