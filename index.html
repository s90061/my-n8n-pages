            <h1>Yang Yi-chan hopes to win Golden Bell Award for Best Supporting Actor, keeps his late sister's lucky charm</h1>
            <p>Actor Yang Yi-chan has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a drama series at the Golden Bell Awards for his role in "Out of the Medical World." He shared that his lucky charm is a protective amulet given to him by his late sister. Actress Janine Chang, who is nominated for Best Actress, also shared her lucky charm. She will play a doctor again in the show, and a needle holder given to her by a doctor is her special item.</p>
            <p>Yang Yi-chan, Janine Chang, Bao Hua (Tsai Ken-yen), David Huang, and Tomi Shung, the producer of "Out of the Medical World," attended a Golden Bell press event today. Yang Yi-chan is nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a drama for this show. He said his sister's lucky charm, a traditional amulet, is very important to him. He carries it with him all the time unless he is filming.</p>
            <p>Yang Yi-chan is attending the Golden Bell Awards again after 10 years. He said that he feels calm about winning. He thought about what made him excited 10 years ago. Now, his body and mind are more balanced. He is happier that he can tell important stories. He recently went to Hualien to help as a "shovel hero" after the earthquake. He shared that he felt very emotional and cried a lot when he saw the situation there. He hopes to do his best to help Hualien.</p>
            <p>Janine Chang said this is her first time being nominated for a Golden Bell Award. She said, "I only walked the red carpet for 'Black & White' in 2009. I felt very far from the Golden Bell Awards, they didn't even ask me to present an award."</p>
            <p>Janine Chang, who is nominated for Best Actress, said she is very happy. She also thinks her competitors are very strong. She said she does not care too much about winning or losing, but she still hopes to go on stage. She jokingly said, "I can give up being the most beautiful on the red carpet, I just want to go on stage (to receive the award)."</p>
            <p>Janine Chang will play a doctor again in the show. She shared that her lucky charm is a "needle holder" given to her by a doctor. Bao Hua, who is also nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a drama, said her lucky charm is a ring made by her daughter. She felt very warm and loved when she received it.</p>
            <p>Singer David Huang is nominated for a Newcomer Award for his first acting role. He laughed and said that he didn't want to act at first. His girlfriend had to leave home 5 times to convince him to take the role. He said, "I never thought I would be here. My world is usually music. But this time, acting brought me many new experiences and lessons. I found out about the nomination on my birthday, it was truly the best birthday gift."</p>

            <h1>China may make it easier to get single-use Taiwan travel permits; Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council says it's for "performance"</h1>
            <p>Beijing might make it easier for Taiwanese people to get a "single-use Taiwan Compatriot Travel Document." This is a special ID card that Taiwanese people need to enter mainland China. This change would mean that more people could get these temporary travel documents.</p>
            <p>However, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said today that this move by China is just to "make their numbers look good." They believe China is not truly trying to help Taiwanese people. The MAC said that China is trying to get more people to use these temporary permits to show that they are "working hard" to get Taiwanese people to visit.</p>
            <p>The MAC also stated that China's real goal is to get more Taiwanese people to go to China. They want to show that their policies are working. The MAC wants Taiwanese people to think carefully before they go to China. They said that people should be aware of any risks or problems they might face when using these temporary travel permits.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan People's Party to open registration for second group of councilor candidates in central Taiwan starting tomorrow</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) announced today that they will open registration for their second group of candidates. These candidates will run for city and county councilor positions in six areas in central Taiwan. These areas are Taichung, Changhua, Nantou, and Yunlin. People who want to be candidates can start signing up tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The TPP is getting ready for the local elections in 2026. This second group of candidates is part of their plan to have more people represent the party. They hope to win more seats in the local councils in central Taiwan. The party is trying to get new people involved in politics.</p>
            <p>The party leaders said that they want people from all walks of life to join. They are looking for people who care about their local communities. They believe that having a variety of candidates will help them connect with more voters. The registration will be open for a set period, and then the party will review the applications to choose their final candidates.</p>
