            <h1>Robot Company Shares Go Up, as Robots May Bring More Business Than Electric Cars</h1>
            <p>The head of TSMC, a big chip-making company, said in a meeting that customers think robots that look like humans will be very important. He said that the chances to make money from these robots could be 10 times bigger than from electric cars. Because of this, the shares of robot companies like Ho Chun and Robo went up a lot.</p>
            <p>TSMC held a meeting on July 17. The head, Mr. Wei, said that strong demand for AI (Artificial Intelligence) and HPC (High-Performance Computing) made their sales go up in the third quarter. This also made them expect more sales for the whole year.</p>
            <p>About the future of human-like robots, Mr. Wei said it's too early for them to be a main reason for growth this year and next year. This is because it is hard to design them. But customers believe that in the future, human-like robots will create 10 times more business than electric cars.</p>
            <p>What Mr. Wei said made people want to buy shares in robot companies today. Ho Chun and Robo shares went to their highest allowed price. Ho Chun reached 110 New Taiwan Dollars and Robo reached 102.5 New Taiwan Dollars. Da Yin Micro Systems reached 122.5 New Taiwan Dollars, which is about a 7.46% increase.</p>

            <h1>Man Hurts Two People with a Selfie Stick and a Saw, Gets 2 Years and 10 Months in Jail</h1>
            <p>A man named Meng hurt people with a selfie stick in Nantun District, Taichung City. Later, he used a saw to hurt a worker at a construction site. The Taichung District Prosecutor's Office charged him with trying to cause serious harm. The Taichung District Court decided yesterday that he must go to jail for 2 years and 10 months. He can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>According to the official report, in March this year, Mr. Meng went to a gas station on Wenxin Road in Nantun. He asked a man named Lai for directions. Mr. Lai did not understand Mr. Meng's question and did not answer. Then, Mr. Meng used a selfie stick to hit Mr. Lai's eye. They fought, and Mr. Meng ran away.</p>
            <p>After that, Mr. Meng went to a construction site near the gas station. He picked up a saw from the ground to leave. A worker named Hong tried to stop him. But Mr. Meng swung the saw at Mr. Hong and ran away. Mr. Hong got a bruise on his head.</p>
            <p>Later, Mr. Meng went to a shopping mall near the construction site and hid in a restaurant bathroom on the third floor. The police were told and they arrested him there. After talking to the police, he was sent to court for trying to kill someone. But the prosecutor decided Mr. Meng did not mean to kill, so he was charged with trying to cause serious harm.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Court looked at the case. The judges noted that Mr. Meng admitted what he did. He also made an agreement with the injured people and paid them back. So, he was sentenced to 2 years and 10 months in jail for trying to cause serious harm.</p>
            <p>We learned that Mr. Meng is known as "Mengge" on Instagram, where he has more than 20,000 followers. After the event, many people online talked about it.</p>

            <h1>Former Professor Chen Ming-cheng Gets 1 Year and 6 Months in Jail for Fake Bridge Checks in Yilan</h1>
            <p>A former professor, Chen Ming-cheng from Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology, was hired to check bridges in Yilan County. He was found to have told people who were not qualified to check the bridges and then made fake records. The court at first sentenced him to 2 years in prison. But after he appealed, the High Court changed the sentence to 1 year and 6 months, and this decision is final.</p>
            <p>The first court decision from Yilan District Court said that Mr. Chen worked at Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology. He was also the head of the Non-Destructive Testing Center and started his own company, Wanqiaofeng Engineering Technology Consulting Co. At the same time, Zhang Caichen, who was an assistant professor at Chien Hsin University, also worked for the testing center and owned shares in Mr. Chen's company.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang took on a job to check bridges and roads in Yilan County. They were accused of sending several people who were not qualified to check bridges and take photos in 8 towns: Sansing, Jiaoxi, Zhuangwei, Wujie, Luodong, Dongshan, Su'ao, and Nanao.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang were also accused of telling several unqualified people to put fake inspection information into the "Second Generation Taiwan Area Bridge Management Information System." They used the names of qualified inspectors. This included fake information for 541 bridges.</p>
            <p>The Yilan District Court, in its first decision, thought that making fake documents just because there were not enough qualified people could make public structures unsafe. Also, they did not show regret for their actions. So, Mr. Chen was sentenced to 2 years in prison, and Ms. Zhang to 1 year and 10 months. They appealed, and the case went to the Taiwan High Court for a second trial.</p>
            <p>In the second trial, the High Court decided that Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang admitted what they did during the trial. The court also considered that Mr. Chen went back to fix some checks on bridges in Sansing and Jiaoxi. This meant his wrongdoing was less serious. Also, Ms. Zhang had a stroke after the incident. Because these things changed, the High Court canceled the first decision. They changed Mr. Chen's sentence to 1 year and 6 months and Ms. Zhang's sentence to 1 year and 2 months. This decision cannot be appealed anymore.</p>
