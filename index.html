            <h1>Markets Watch US Company Reports and Trade Talks; Asian Stocks Are Mixed</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong, July 22 (CNA) â€“ The grace period for US tariffs will end next week. Traders are looking at company reports from the US this week. They are also watching how trade talks with the US are going. Because of this, Asian stock markets closed with mixed results today.</p>
            <p>AFP reports that most main US stock indexes went up yesterday. The S&P 500 index went over 6300 points for the first time. The Nasdaq Composite index also reached a new high. After this, investors became more careful.</p>
            <p>Stock prices kept going up because people in the market expect that the US's main trading partners will make a deal with Washington. This deal needs to happen before August 1st, when the tariff grace period ends. This is to avoid high tariffs that President Trump put in place.</p>
            <p>President Trump first shocked global markets with high, equal tariffs on April 2nd. But he later extended the deadline for these tariffs two times. This made the market react less strongly to Trump's later threats. Investors think he will give in again in the end.</p>
            <p>This week, the market will also focus on the financial reports of some big global companies. These include Tesla, Google's parent company Alphabet, General Motors (GM), Intel, and Coca-Cola.</p>
            <p>In Asian stock markets, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, and Manila stock markets closed higher. But Tokyo, Seoul, Wellington, Taipei, and Jakarta stock markets closed lower. (Translator: Chen Cheng-chien/Editor: Liu Shu-chin) 1140722</p>
