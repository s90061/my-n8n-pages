            <h1>A 5.4 Earthquake Hits Tainan's Nanhua, No Damage on Roads Managed by Highway Bureau</h1>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Administration, a strong earthquake happened today at 2:06 PM. It was a 5.4 magnitude earthquake. The earthquake's center was in Nanhua District, Tainan City, about 42 kilometers northeast of the Tainan City Government. The Ministry of Transportation's Highway Bureau said they are checking roads in their care where the shaking was level 4 or more. So far, there is no damage.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau sent out a press release. It said that after an earthquake, it is easy for rocks and soil to fall on mountain roads. This makes it hard to know how safe the roads are. People should not go on mountain roads unless they really need to. They should also always look at the road signs (CMS) on both sides of the road for the newest information about traffic and safety. They can also use the Highway Bureau's website for live traffic news or their "Happy Highway App."</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau asks people to check for road updates from the Highway Bureau and police radio. They should also know the road conditions in areas where the earthquake happened so they can plan their journeys.</p>

            <h1>Lithuanian Airports Get New CT Scanners, Making It Easier to Carry Liquids</h1>
            <p>The two main airports in Lithuania, Vilnius and Kaunas, have announced new rules for security checks. Now, travelers will not need to take liquids out of their carry-on bags. Before, these airports already stopped the rule about taking out electronic devices. Now, the rules for liquids are also easier. This will make going through the airport quicker and simpler.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Lithuanian Airports Company (LTOU) announced that new CT (Computed Tomography) scanning machines are now used. Also, at the end of July, the European Commission decided to stop the "100 ml liquid limit" rule, which had been in place for almost 20 years. Because of these changes, starting today, travelers can carry liquids in their carry-on bags. Each container can hold up to 2 liters of liquid. The type and shape of the containers do not matter.</p>
            <p>Before, under old European Union rules, liquids in carry-on bags had to be in small containers, no more than 100 milliliters each. These containers also had to be put into a clear plastic bag that could hold 1 liter. During security checks, these items had to be taken out to be looked at.</p>
            <p>Vidas KÅ¡anas, who is in charge of security at LTOU, said that the new scanning machines can see electronic items and liquids in 3D. This means they can be checked without being taken out of bags. He added that these machines meet the best safety standards. He also said that the new rules will make travelers less worried and make security checks faster. This will help the airport serve more people.</p>
            <p>Juras Taminskas, the Deputy Minister of Transport in Lithuania, said that many travelers used to feel anxious because security checks were complicated. Now, travelers at these two airports will not have to worry about this. Mr. Taminskas is also happy that Lithuania is the first country in the Baltic area to use these new, modern security machines.</p>
            <p>Mr. KÅ¡anas reminded everyone that these new, easier rules for liquids are only for some airports in Europe right now. Many small and medium-sized airports in Europe still have the old rules (100 ml limit and clear bags) because they do not have the new CT scanners yet. Also, airlines still have their own rules for how much carry-on bags can weigh and how big they can be. Travelers should always check their airline's rules.</p>

            <h1>First Bank Becomes First Local Bank to Sell TISA Funds Starting August 25</h1>
            <p>First Bank announced today that it will start selling TISA funds from August 25. This is to support the government's plan to start "Taiwan Individual Savings Accounts (TISA)." Customers can invest in these funds using a special trust account. First Bank is the first bank in Taiwan to offer this. People can start investing with as little as 1,000 New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). There will be no fees for buying the funds. Also, until the end of this year, there will be no fees for managing the trust account.</p>
            <p>First Bank said in a press release today that you can start investing in TISA funds with just NT$1,000. This is good for young people or those who are investing for the first time to begin managing their money. There are no buying fees, and the fund management fee is less than 1%. This means it costs much less to invest. Also, these funds are in New Taiwan Dollars and do not give out regular payments (dividends). All the money earned from dividends goes back into the main investment. This helps the money grow faster over time.</p>
            <p>First Bank stated that TISA funds are mainly for "regular investments of the same amount." You need to keep paying money into the fund for 24 months. If you stop paying, you cannot buy new units of the fund for 6 months. This rule helps customers learn to invest for a long time.</p>
            <p>First Bank explained that after customers open a TISA account with them, they can use the "TISA Fund" part of the "First e-Wealth Management" website to choose what to invest in and buy online. They can also go to a bank branch to do their transactions. This helps them create their own plan for long-term investing.</p>
            <p>First Bank said that financial experts have carefully chosen TISA funds. The funds must meet certain rules: they must have existed for at least 3 years, have a value of at least 500 million New Taiwan Dollars, and have received at least 3 stars from Morningstar for any time period, or at least a 3-level rating for how well they protect money from Lipper. These rules make sure the funds have a good history and can be easily bought or sold.</p>
            <p>First Bank said it will continue to follow its goal of "always being there for you." They will offer many different ways to invest that meet what customers need. Whether you are a young person who likes to invest in more risky ways, or someone who is almost retired and wants safe income, you can use their easy banking services. This will help you get used to investing for a long time and plan for your retirement early. This helps everyone have access to financial services.</p>
