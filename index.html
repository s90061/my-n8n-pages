            <h1>Vietnam's 80th National Day is huge; China, Russia, and other communist countries gather for a military parade</h1>
            <p>Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is busy getting ready for the 80th National Day on September 2nd. China, Russia, Belarus, Laos, and Cambodia will send their soldiers to join a military parade. This is a big gathering of "friendly" communist countries. The government announced yesterday that Zhao Leji, the third-highest official in China, will lead a group to visit Vietnam. He will meet with Vietnam's four main leaders and attend the National Day ceremony.</p>
            <p>On September 2nd, Vietnam will celebrate the 80th anniversary of the August Revolution and National Day. China, Russia, Belarus, Laos, and Cambodia will send their military forces to the parade.</p>
            <p>Vietnam's Ministry of Defense said earlier that these five countries are "traditional friendly nations" to Vietnam. Their armies also work closely with Vietnam's army. Soldiers from Russia, Laos, and Cambodia arrived early and have been practicing for the parade since August 21st.</p>
            <p>China is a "communist brother" to Vietnam. China will send a special guard unit to the parade in Ba Dinh Square. Also, Zhao Leji, who is a top official in China and leads the National People's Congress, will lead a Chinese group to visit Vietnam officially. He will also go to the National Day celebration.</p>
            <p>Lately, it was reported that Vietnam is building land fast in the South China Sea, like China. China said it "strongly opposes countries building on illegally taken islands." Even with this, Vietnam and China are trying hard to keep their diplomatic relationship friendly.</p>
            <p>Zhao Leji, China's third-highest political leader, will arrive in Vietnam on August 31st. He plans to meet with Vietnam's four main leaders: T√¥ L√¢m, the General Secretary of the Communist Party; L∆∞∆°ng C∆∞·ªùng, the President; Ph·∫°m Minh Ch√≠nh, the Prime Minister. He will also lead the first meeting of a cooperation committee between Vietnam's National Assembly and China's National People's Congress with Tr·∫ßn Thanh M·∫´n, Vietnam's National Assembly Chairman.</p>
            <p>So far, the Vietnamese government has announced that the five countries mentioned above, plus high-level officials from Cuba, will send groups to the National Day event. The list of other high-level groups from other countries has not been shared yet.</p>
            <p>This year's 80th National Day will be bigger than ever before. Vietnam will celebrate it with the highest standards and resources. Vietnamese people living abroad are also joining the celebrations.</p>
            <p>Also, the government announced it will give 100,000 Vietnamese Dong (about 117 New Taiwan Dollars) to every citizen for the first time. This is to "show that the Party and the country care about all people."</p>
            <p>In August 1945, the Vietnamese Communist Party started a revolution. They ended 80 years of French rule and Japan's control during World War II. Two weeks later, on September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh read the "Declaration of Independence" in Ba Dinh Square. This declared the start of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Vietnam and China will have events one after another. The day after Vietnam's National Day, on September 3rd, Beijing will also have a big military parade. This parade will "celebrate the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the World Anti-Fascist War." Russian President Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have confirmed they will attend. It will be the first time these three leaders stand together.</p>

            <h1>Dongyuan Little League Team Wins Fans in Western US; Williamport Victory Inspires Asian American Children</h1>
            <p>The Dongyuan Elementary School baseball team won the Little League World Series in Williamsport. This made many Taiwanese-American and Asian-American children in the US feel inspired. Taiwanese people in the Western US held a party for the team today. It felt like a fan meeting and autograph session. Many young fans who grew up in the US and love baseball said they were proud of their Taiwanese background.</p>
            <p>Before returning to Taiwan, the Dongyuan Little League team arrived at a beef noodle restaurant in Cupertino, a big city in California's Silicon Valley, tonight. They came for a party with Taiwanese people from the Western US. Many parents brought their sons and daughters who love baseball. They waited with flags and signs that said "Welcome World Champions." As soon as the team got off the bus, they received warm applause.</p>
            <p>"I want to ask them how they warm up and what their daily preparations are before a game," said Zhao Zhongkang, whose grandparents are from Taiwan. He said baseball is as important as a partner in life. "Without baseball, I wouldn't be as happy as I am now." He thinks the Dongyuan Little League team played very well. He really envies the pitcher, Lin Jinze, because his pitches are very fast.</p>
            <p>Another boy, Huang Rongshan, told reporters that he came especially to congratulate Taiwan's Little League team. They won the World Series championship again after a long time. "I have Taiwanese blood, and I am very excited for them."</p>
            <p>Huang Rongshan said the Dongyuan Little League team played wonderfully. They had very good defense and excellent hitting. This is why they beat their opponent 7-0. "When he (Lin Jinze) pitched, he pitched really well. He completely stopped the opponents. I hope I can do that too." Huang Rongshan hopes to achieve his dream of playing in the Little League next year.</p>
            <p>"This is a big dream for me, and it really needs a lot of hard work," Huang Rongshan said. When he grows up, he hopes to join a college baseball team, then a professional baseball team, and always enjoy playing.</p>
            <p>Nguyen Junwei, standing nearby, said it was "really cool" that Taiwan won the Little League World Series championship in Williamsport again after 29 years. He came here today with his family and really wanted to meet the players he admires.</p>
            <p>Dongyuan Elementary School won the Little League World Series for Taiwan this year. This greatly encouraged Asian-American children in the US, more than 10,000 kilometers away. Many of them love playing baseball every day and even see "Williamsport" as a dream.</p>
            <p>The event felt like a fan meeting and autograph session with idols. The coaches were busy signing autographs for older Taiwanese people. The young players were surrounded by younger Taiwanese children. Lin Jinze threw a 132 km/h fastball in the championship game. This made many boys who love baseball in the San Francisco Bay Area look up to him. They privately asked their parents why the young Taiwanese player could throw such a "monster pitch."</p>
            <p>The Dongyuan Little League team kept their humble and polite attitude throughout. They signed autographs for all fans, big and small. They won over countless fans and built friendships between children in Taiwan and the US.</p>

            <h1>Armored Police Car Hits and Kills Motorcyclist; Indonesian Students Vow to Protest</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a protest outside the Indonesian parliament turned violent. An armored police car hit and killed a motorcyclist. Indonesian students said they will go to the Jakarta police headquarters today to protest.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Muzammil Ihsan, the leader of Indonesia's biggest student group, said students will gather this afternoon. They will protest against police violence. Other student groups are expected to join them.</p>
            <p>Yesterday's protest outside the parliament was about issues like how much money lawmakers earn, funding for education, and a government plan for school meals. Local news said that the protest continued into the night. Then, riot police fired tear gas and used water cannons to break up the crowd.</p>
            <p>Jakarta Police Chief Asep Edi Suheri said that during the conflict, an armored police car hit and killed a motorcycle taxi driver on the spot. The motorcycle drivers' association stated that the person who died was not part of the protest.</p>
            <p>Suheri said at a press conference last night, "As the police chief, I offer my deepest apologies and sadness on behalf of the entire force."</p>
            <p>Abdul Karim, who leads the Indonesian police's professional and security department, said at a press conference that seven police officers from the armored car have been arrested. They are now being investigated.</p>
            <p>Local media reported that after the incident, groups led by motorcyclists protested last night in front of the riot police headquarters. Kompas TV in Indonesia reported today that the military has sent people to calm down dozens of protesting motorcyclists.</p>
            <p>The "Jakarta Legal Aid" group posted on Instagram. They asked the government and police to release the 600 people arrested during the protest.</p>
