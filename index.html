            <h1>EVA Air Flight Attendant Dies; Union Demands Changes and Threatens Protest at Marathon</h1>
            <p>A flight attendant for EVA Air sadly passed away after working while sick and returning to Taiwan. This event has made many people concerned. The EVA Air company union and other groups have made three demands. They want to stop employers from treating staff badly when they take sick leave. They also said that if company leaders continue to hide, they will protest at the EVA Air marathon event.</p>
            <p>One EVA Air flight attendant worked while unwell and died after coming back to Taiwan. EVA Air said they would look into the matter quickly. The Taoyuan City Labor Inspection Office recently checked the airline's work hours and rest times. They found that these followed the Labor Standards Act. EVA Air did not stop flight attendants from taking leave. However, taking certain types of leave can affect a person's work performance score.</p>
            <p>This event has made people pay attention to sick leave rules for workers. Today, the EVA Air company union and the Taoyuan City Flight Attendants Union held a press conference outside the Legislative Yuan. Many members held white flowers and signs that said "Special leave is not a crime." They shouted "Life is priceless."</p>
            <p>Li Yihan, a flight attendant, explained that EVA Air's rules for taking leave are very strict. If you are sick on a normal weekday, you lose 1 point. If you are sick on a weekend or a public holiday, you lose 2 points. If you are sick during New Year's or Lunar New Year, you lose 3 points. Also, if you take more than 4 days of unplanned special leave, you cannot ask for specific flights or days off anymore.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if flight attendants take unplanned special leave during public holidays or busy seasons, their work schedule becomes fixed. They cannot change it. This means they lose control over their personal life.</p>
            <p>Li Yihan also said that flight attendants cannot get sick on days when they have already changed shifts. This is because if you take sick leave for a changed shift, your schedule will be fixed, and you cannot change shifts again. If you get sick, need to go to the hospital, or have surgery, your work performance will be affected. You will also lose some of your year-end bonus and discounted flight tickets.</p>
            <p>Li Yihan stated that the flight attendant who passed away kept changing her shifts even when she was sick. She also worked over many national holidays. Li Yihan asked, "How much stress did she feel inside?" She believes this system is very bad. This strict management makes staff worry about leave rules even when they are sick. She asked, "What kind of terrible workplace is this?"</p>
            <p>Li Yihan pointed out that these rules are legal but not fair. They make flight attendants afraid to rest properly when they are sick. They often get bladder infections, vaginal infections, or even blood in their urine and fevers. Even if they are in great pain, they can only keep taking antibiotics and medicine. This cycle never stops and is very stressful. But they are afraid to take leave because it means losing points.</p>
            <p>Li Yihan said that in this system of punishment that keeps repeating, a life was lost that cannot be brought back. She asked EVA Air to fix the work schedules and other long-term problems.</p>
            <p>Li Ying, who leads the EVA Air company union, said that the union hopes to change the leave system and all of EVA Air's management rules. She believes EVA Air should give rewards to staff for coming to work instead of punishing them.</p>
            <p>Li Ying also said that when working at EVA Air, if staff want to use their special leave to see a doctor, their work schedule will be fixed. If they take leave because of a natural disaster, they will also be punished. This is not fair. EVA Air should review its leave system, which causes mental and physical stress to everyone.</p>
            <p>Finally, Chou Sheng-kai, the secretary-general of the Taoyuan City Flight Attendants Union, said that it has been 5 days since the event happened. But EVA Air's senior leaders have not appeared and have not said how they will improve things. The union will have a regular meeting with EVA Air on October 21st. They demand that senior managers who can make decisions attend this meeting.</p>
            <p>Chou Sheng-kai also said that EVA Air will hold a marathon on October 26th. The chairman, Lin Bao-shui, and general manager, Sun Jia-ming, will both be there. If the senior leaders continue to hide, the union will go to the marathon to give a letter of complaint and ask EVA Air to solve the problem properly.</p>

            <h1>Indonesia Volcano Erupts All Night, Ash Plume Rises 10 Kilometers, May Affect Flights</h1>
            <p>An Indonesian volcano on an island erupted last night. Today, authorities said that the volcano sent a very big cloud of ash 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) into the sky. They have also announced the highest level of alert.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, a volcano on Flores Island in Indonesia, erupted late last night and early this morning. Indonesia's national volcano agency stated that volcanic material was thrown 10 kilometers above the 1,584-meter-high mountain top.</p>
            <p>So far, there are no reports of people being hurt or property being damaged. However, authorities have warned people living on the island and tourists to stay away from the volcano area. They should also be ready to leave at any time.</p>
            <p>Muhammad Wafid, the head of Indonesia's geology agency, said that they saw more deep earthquake activity. This usually happens before a strong eruption. Because of this, they raised the volcano alert to the highest level last night.</p>
            <p>Wafid pointed out that if the large ash cloud from the eruption spreads further, it could "affect how airports work and where flights can go."</p>
            <p>The airport announced on Instagram that the local airport in Maumere town has stopped working. Maumere is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki.</p>
            <p>The Indonesian geology agency also warned that if there is heavy rain, people living near rivers should be careful of volcanic mudflows. These mudflows are a dangerous mix of volcanic ash and rainwater.</p>
            <p>In July this year, the same volcano also erupted. It sent a huge ash cloud 18 kilometers (about 11 miles) high. This caused 24 flights at Bali International Airport to be canceled.</p>
            <p>Indonesia is a large country with many islands. It is located on the "Ring of Fire," an area where many earthquakes and volcano eruptions happen. This area goes from Japan to Southeast Asia and across the entire Pacific Ocean. It is one of the places with the most earthquakes and volcanic activity.</p>
