Taiwan's three main telecom companies had great performance in 2024, the best in recent years. Their upcoming dividend payouts are getting a lot of attention. Together, these three companies will pay out over NT$65.2 billion in cash dividends, which is the most in five years. This money will help the stock market. The telecom companies are also showing their progress in AI, cloud services, and cybersecurity, helping other industries grow.

Chunghwa Telecom will start its dividend payout on July 3rd, giving NT$5 per share. This is the highest payout rate since 2017 among the three companies, totaling NT$38.78 billion. Taiwan Mobile will pay NT$4.5 per share on July 9th, a total of NT$13.6 billion. Far EasTone will also pay NT$3.56 per share on July 9th, totaling NT$12.83 billion.

Chunghwa Telecom made NT$4.8 per share last year, a 7-year high. Its chairman, Jian Zhi-cheng, said that despite mergers by competitors, Chunghwa Telecom is using AI and digital transformation to reach new highs in 2025. The company's stock price reached a new high of NT$137.5 on June 27th, and its market value is now over a trillion NT dollars. Jian said this is because of their work in AI, strong networks, and good service. Also, as a local service company, Chunghwa Telecom is seen as a safe investment during economic changes.

Chunghwa Telecom stated that its business services, including cloud, data centers, and cybersecurity, have grown by more than 10% each year. They plan to increase the share of regular income from these services.

Taiwan Mobile's business profit grew by 30% in the first quarter of 2025, the best in nearly seven years. Its net profit after tax increased by 23%. Taiwan Mobile's president, Lin Chih-chen, described the company as an "AI-driven tech telecom giant" and is investing in new areas like AI, cybersecurity, cloud, and Web3. He expects the company's profits to continue growing by double digits. Taiwan Mobile expects its business service revenue to grow by 20% this year, with cloud and AI growing by 223% and cybersecurity by 94%.

Far EasTone's profits have been steady due to its merger, more 5G users, and growth in digital services. From January to May, its net profit after tax was NT$5.46 billion, up 10.5%. Far EasTone plans to finish moving Asia Pacific Telecom users by the end of this year and increase 5G usage. Far EasTone's president, Jing Qi, said their average revenue per user (ARPU) is the highest in the industry. She expects mobile service revenue to be over NT$60 billion in 2024, a new high in eight years.

Far EasTone will continue to grow its new economy and value-added services. Business and government projects now make up 57% of its new economy income, more than consumer services, helping the company earn more profit.
