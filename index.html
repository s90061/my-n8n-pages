            <h1>FBI: DNA at Scene of US Conservative Influencer Kirk's Murder Matches Suspect</h1>
            <p>Kash Patel, who is the head of the FBI, said today that DNA taken from where Charlie Kirk was killed matches Tyler Robinson, who is suspected of the crime.</p>
            <p>Tyler Robinson, who is 22 years old, was caught on September 12th after police looked for him for 33 hours. He is expected to be officially charged with murder later this week.</p>
            <p>Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10th during a speech at a university in Utah. He started a very important conservative group for young people called "Turning Point USA."</p>
            <p>Authorities said the suspect used a sniper rifle from a roof. He fired one shot that hit Kirk in the neck.</p>
            <p>Patel said on Fox News this morning, "Today, I can tell you that the DNA on a towel wrapped around the gun and on a screwdriver found at the crime scene both match the DNA of the suspect we have arrested."</p>
            <p>Patel also mentioned that Robinson is believed to have written a note before the crime.</p>
            <p>Patel said the note "basically said... 'I have a chance to get rid of Kirk, and I will take this chance.' This note was written before the shooting."</p>
            <p>He added that the note was left at the suspect's home.</p>
            <p>Patel said, "Even if the note was destroyed, we still found forensic evidence related to it."</p>

            <h1>Spain's Prime Minister Supports Pro-Palestine Protest at Cycling Race, Causing Political and Diplomatic Conflict</h1>
            <p>Yesterday in Madrid, Spain, about 100,000 people took over the cycling race track. They were protesting Israel's actions in Gaza, calling it "genocide." This forced the last part of the race to stop, which had never happened before. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he supported the protestors. This made other political parties angry, and Israel's foreign minister said it was shameful.</p>
            <p>The Spanish newspaper El País reported that before the last part of the Vuelta a España race had to be stopped, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who strongly supports Palestine and has often spoken against Israel, publicly praised and agreed with the protestors.</p>
            <p>Sánchez said, "Spain is a proud example. We have taken a step to protect human rights. We support what is right. Long live the people of Spain!"</p>
            <p>Because of this, Gideon Saar, Israel's Foreign Minister, said that Sánchez's words encouraged pro-Palestinian people to protest in the streets, which ruined the cycling race. He strongly criticized Sánchez and his left-wing government, calling them "a shame for Spain."</p>
            <p>Spain's biggest right-wing opposition party, the People's Party (PP), also used this chance to attack Sánchez. Today, the leader of the People's Party, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, and the mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, both said that Sánchez should be held responsible for the "violent actions that brought shame to the country."</p>
            <p>They said they support freedom of speech and legal protests. But they also said that this should not be mixed with stopping a sports event because the protest put the lives of cyclists and police officers in danger.</p>
            <p>Feijóo strongly stated, "Stopping a sports event from finishing is political violence."</p>
            <p>Even though he was heavily criticized since yesterday, Sánchez repeated today at a meeting of his left-wing Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) that he is always against violence. However, he has "great respect and admiration for the people of Spain who stand up against unfairness and peacefully defend their beliefs."</p>
            <p>Sánchez believes that the people of Spain, no matter their politics or which party they support, will always defend "human rights and international law." He thinks that Israel and Russia are currently breaking these rights and laws.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Sánchez asked that Israel and Russia should face punishment until they stop their cruel actions. He said they "should not be allowed to take part in any international sports events."</p>
            <p>This year's Vuelta a España cycling race included an Israeli professional team called Israel-Premier Tech. Also, the team's owner is a good friend of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. This started a wave of protests to support the Palestinian people. For three weeks since the race began, many people have gathered to protest along the race routes.</p>
            <p>On September 14th, the finish line for the last part of the Vuelta a España was in Cibeles Plaza, where the Madrid City Council is. But many protestors went into the road before the finish line, pushed down barriers, and blocked the track. This led to violent fights with the police.</p>
            <p>To keep the cyclists safe, the organizers had to end the race early and cancel the award ceremony. This was the first time this had ever happened in the history of the three major cycling tours: the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, and the Vuelta a España.</p>
            <p>The protestors held Palestinian flags, showing support for the Palestinian people suffering from the war. They said that Israel's attacks in the Gaza Strip were "not war, but genocide." They loudly shouted, "Netanyahu is a killer!" and "Free Palestine!"</p>
            <p>The Gaza War started in October 2023 when the Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel. This killed 1219 people and took more than 200 people as hostages. After this, Israel launched a large attack on the Gaza Strip, which Hamas controls.</p>
            <p>According to health numbers from the Gaza Strip, this war has now killed over 60,000 Palestinians. Most of them were civilians.</p>
            <p>Since the Gaza War started, the Spanish government has continuously said that Israel's military attacks go against international law. They believe that a "two-state solution" is the only way for peace between Israel and Palestine. In May 2024, Spain recognized the state of Palestine and has actively pushed for actions against Israel, like stopping weapon sales. Because of this, Spain's relationship with Israel remains tense.</p>

            <h1>Trump's Visit to the UK; US and UK to Announce Over $10 Billion Agreement</h1>
            <p>Today, high-level US officials said that during President Donald Trump's visit to the UK this week, the US and the UK plan to announce economic agreements worth over 10 billion US dollars in total.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, US officials said in a phone briefing that the two governments plan to sign a trade agreement with three main parts. These parts include creating new technology partnerships to make both countries' technology industries stronger, working together on peaceful nuclear energy, and helping each other with defense technology.</p>
            <p>Officials said that many important people from the US technology industry are expected to be at this visit.</p>
            <p>Trump and the First Lady, Melania Trump, will arrive tomorrow evening. On the 17th, they will meet with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. They will also attend a state dinner that evening.</p>
            <p>On the 18th, Trump will meet with the Prime Minister of the UK, Keir Starmer. They plan to hold a joint press conference. After that, Trump will fly back to Washington D.C. on the evening of the 18th.</p>
            <p>Trump is the first US President to be invited to a state dinner in the UK twice. The first time was in 2019, during his first term as president.</p>
            <p>US officials said that the upcoming agreements will focus on working together economically. The total amount is expected to be at least 10 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>One US official said, "This visit gives the President a chance to make our relationship stronger with this very close partner and friend. At the same time, it helps both countries with their shared economic and foreign policy goals."</p>
