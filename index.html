            <h1>Man Dies in Taichung, Filipino Man Suspected and Held by Police</h1>
            <p>Taichung, September 8 (CNA) â€“ Yesterday morning, a 41-year-old man named Lee was found lying by the road in Tanzi District, Taichung City. He was taken to the hospital but died from his serious injuries. The police found a Filipino man who had stayed in Taiwan longer than allowed. They believe he was involved in the case and arrested him. After questioning, the prosecutor asked the court tonight to keep the Filipino man in custody for murder.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office said in a press release tonight that the Daya Police Station was told on the morning of September 7 that Mr. Lee, 41, was found seriously hurt and later died on Fengxing Road in Tanzi District. The police immediately asked prosecutors to form a special team to collect information and evidence.</p>
            <p>The special team looked into what Mr. Lee did before he died and checked related records. On September 7, the police found and arrested the 26-year-old Filipino man who had overstayed his visa. After a prosecutor and a forensic doctor examined Mr. Lee's body, an autopsy has been planned.</p>
            <p>After more questioning today, the prosecutor believes the Filipino man is strongly suspected of murder under the criminal law. There is a good reason to think he might run away or destroy evidence. So, tonight, the prosecutor asked the Taiwan Taichung District Court to keep him in custody.</p>
