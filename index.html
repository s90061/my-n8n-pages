            <h1>New Taipei Nursing Home Opens First Hospice Ward for People with Disabilities</h1>
            <p>Today, the "Xiaoming Xuan" hospice ward at New Taipei City's Aiwei Nursing Home started working. The city's Social Welfare Department said this is the first nursing home in the country to have a hospice ward. This means residents can finish their lives peacefully in a familiar place with their families.</p>
            <p>Xu Hsiu-Neng, the Deputy Director of the Social Welfare Department, attended the opening event. She said that Aiwei Nursing Home opened in 1998. It takes care of people with severe mental and physical disabilities who cannot take care of themselves. Right now, there are more than 160 residents, and their average age is almost 50.</p>
            <p>Xu Hsiu-Neng also said in a press release that the city supports putting hospice wards in places for people with disabilities. This is because families need to be with their loved ones at the end of life. This is the first time in the country this has happened. "Xiaoming Xuan" means light and faith. It hopes to "walk through the dark and welcome eternal life."</p>
            <p>The hospice ward also works with the hospice team from MacKay Memorial Hospital in Tamsui. They offer full care. "Xiaoming Xuan" respects everyone's beliefs. It has things for both Catholic and Christian faiths, and also pictures of Buddha.</p>
            <p>The Social Welfare Department said the hospice ward has big windows where you can see Taipei Port and Guanyin Mountain. It also uses essential oils and calm music to make a warm feeling. Bishop Chao Yung-Chi from the Catholic Archdiocese of Taipei led the blessing ceremony.</p>
            <p>Yonghe Chenshen Hospital runs Aiwei Nursing Home for the city. Its director, Chao Chia-Lun, said this is the first example of hospice care in a center for people with disabilities. They will work with the MacKay team to help patients and their families finish their journey with love.</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-Fang, the CEO of the Hospice Care Foundation, said that this year is the 35th year for the foundation. Taking care of people with disabilities is harder than regular long-term care. She said that all the caregivers in the hospice ward are like "angels."</p>
            <p>Chien Mei-Ting, the director of the nursing home, added that 28 residents have signed papers to refuse emergency help, and 8 have made advance medical plans. They have also held funerals for residents without family and completed tree burials. This shows their idea of service, which is "making love a home."</p>
