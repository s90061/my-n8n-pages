The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office was investigating a case of forged signatures on recall petitions. Nineteen volunteers and their relatives from the Kuomintang (KMT) New Taipei City branch confessed to helping copy these petitions. As a result, they have received deferred prosecution for one year. They must attend 3 hours of legal education and either pay a fine of NT$10,000 to NT$30,000 or perform 40 hours of community service. The High Prosecutors' Office has upheld this decision, making the deferred prosecution final for all 19 people.

**US Imposes 30% Tariff, Mexico Continues Negotiations, Financial Sector Estimates Small Impact**

US President Trump announced a 30% tariff on goods from Mexico, starting August 1st. Mexican President Sheinbaum stated that discussions are still ongoing, hoping for a resolution before the tariffs take effect. Financial experts believe that the actual impact on Mexico might be small because the US has not fully implemented previous tariff measures. Even though a US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement exists, many Mexican goods sent to the US could still be affected. However, only a small percentage of Mexico's exports to the US have actually been taxed so far.

**Foreign Investors' Net Short Position in Taiwan Index Futures Reaches New High; Institutions: Focus on National Stabilization Fund's Continued Support**

Foreign investors' net short positions in Taiwan index futures reached a new high, with 59,873 contracts on July 14th. This comes as the US restarts trade tariffs, even though US stock markets, including the Nasdaq, closed higher. Market experts say that Taiwan's stock market is currently affected by three main factors: chip tariffs, US-Taiwan tariffs, and the impact of the rising New Taiwan Dollar. Investors are watching to see if Taiwan's National Stabilization Fund will continue to support the market and what information will be shared at TSMC's investor conference on July 17th.
