            <h1>Parliament Committee Approves Fines Up to NT$90,000 for Parking Lots Not Following Electric Car Charging Rules</h1>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan's Transportation Committee today approved changes to some rules in the Parking Lot Act. These changes say that if a public parking lot does not follow the rules for "Electric Vehicle Charging Spaces and Charging Facilities," and does not fix the problem after being told to, the person in charge can be fined up to NT$90,000.</p>
            <p>To make it easier for electric cars, the current Parking Lot Act says that public parking lots must have special parking spots and charging facilities for electric cars. The details for how many spots, what kind of charging facilities, and other rules are set by the central government in the "Electric Vehicle Charging Spaces and Charging Facilities Management Regulations." However, there was no punishment for public parking lots that broke these rules.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan's Transportation Committee approved a first reading of changes to the Parking Lot Act. It clearly states that if a public parking lot does not follow the "Electric Vehicle Charging Spaces and Charging Facilities Management Regulations," and they are told to fix it but do not, or if they are checked again and still do not meet the rules, the person in charge can be fined between NT$9,000 and NT$90,000. They will also be told to fix the problem again.</p>
            <p>The approved rules also state that if they still do not fix the problem by the deadline, they can be fined again and again. If needed, their business can be stopped for up to 30 days.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Transportation Committee today also approved changes to some rules in the Highway Act. In recent years, after several public transportation accidents, victims found it hard to get money for damages because bus and taxi companies did not have third-party insurance. This sometimes meant that the drivers who caused the accidents had to pay a lot of money themselves, causing financial problems and social issues.</p>
            <p>The approved rules clearly state that bus companies, city bus companies, tourist bus companies, and taxi companies must now have third-party insurance, in addition to passenger liability insurance. The Ministry of Transportation will decide the minimum amount of coverage. If they do not have the required insurance, bus companies, city bus companies, and tourist bus companies will be fined between NT$100,000 and NT$500,000. Taxi companies will be fined between NT$3,000 and NT$30,000.</p>
            <p>Also, the approved rules state that companies that put pipes or manholes in public roads must repair them correctly after placing or fixing them. The road surface must be level with the nearby road. When checked with a 3-meter straight edge, the height difference at any point should not be more than plus or minus 0.6 centimeters. The Ministry of Transportation will set the standard for how much friction the road surface should have.</p>
            <p>The approved rules say that if a company breaks these rules, they must fix it by a certain date. If they do not fix it by then, they will be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000 and told to fix it again. If they still do not fix it, they will be fined again and again.</p>

            <p>After helping his high school team, Guangfu High School, win two straight HBL (High School Basketball League) championships, Hsieh Ming-chun, who is only 19 years old, went to study in the United States to try a different path in basketball. During that time, he was even chosen for the East team roster of the McDonald's All-American Game. After joining the TPBL (Taiwan Professional Basketball League) rookie draft, he was picked by the Mars team as the 4th player in the first round, making his dream of becoming a professional basketball player come true.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-chun officially signed with the Mars team today and chose to continue wearing jersey number 15, the same number he wore at Guangfu High School. He said through the team that he hopes to learn more American-style basketball from his senior player Samuel Manu, keep getting better, and he set a goal to "guard Jeremy Lin and win first place."</p>
            <p>Also, guard Wei Peng-he, who was picked by the Mars team in the second round, also signed his contract today. He stated his goals as "championship, Rookie of the Year, and consistent performance," showing his strong desire to succeed. When asked about the chance to play against his older brother, Wei Lang-zhe, who plays for Kaohsiung Aquas, Wei Peng-he smiled and said that his brother told him to enjoy the draft, "but when we play against each other on the court, I won't let him enjoy it so much."</p>
