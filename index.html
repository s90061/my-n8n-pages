            <h1>Universiade Women's Gymnastics: Chen Rui-an Ranks 3rd in All-Around and Reaches Finals</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 25 (CNA) In Germany, the Universiade women's artistic gymnastics held its team finals today. There were also qualifying rounds for individual all-around and individual events. Tonya Helene Paulsson, a mixed-race girl who moved from Sweden to Taiwan, did very well. She ranked 3rd in the individual all-around, 6th on the balance beam, and 7th on the floor exercise. She reached the finals in these three events.</p>
            <p>For the women's team, Taiwan's team got 150.000 points. They finished in 6th place and did not win a medal.</p>
            <p>Chen Rui-an (Tonya Helene Paulsson) is 21 years old. Her father is Swedish, and her mother is Taiwanese. This year, she changed her nationality to represent Taiwan for the first time at the Universiade. She performed very well. In the individual all-around qualifying round, she got a total of 53.350 points and ranked 3rd.</p>
            <p>At the Asian Artistic Gymnastics Championships in June this year, Chen Rui-an got 4th place in the individual all-around with 52.499 points, just missing a medal. At the Universiade, her score was even higher. If she can keep her good performance in the individual all-around final, she has a good chance to win Taiwan's first Universiade women's gymnastics medal.</p>
            <p>Besides her great performance in the individual all-around, Chen Rui-an also reached the finals for the balance beam and floor exercise. She scored 13.250 points on the balance beam, ranking 6th. She scored 12.800 points on the floor exercise, ranking 7th. Chen Rui-an is the only athlete from Taiwan's women's artistic gymnastics team who made it to the finals.</p>
            <p>Her coach, Cheng Kun-chieh, told CNA reporters that Chen Rui-an performed as well as expected. She showed what she practices every day. Her individual all-around score was better than at the Asian Championships, which means she is in good shape. She has a chance to win a medal in the finals.

            <h1>Ke Jing-hsien Moves Up to Dodgers' Single-A; Dominated Rookie League Like a "Getting on Base Machine"</h1>
            <p>Los Angeles, July 24 (CNA) Ke Jing-hsien, an 18-year-old Taiwanese baseball player (outfielder), has done very well in the Dodgers' rookie league this year. He is good at getting on base and hitting for power. He played in 52 games and got on base in 50 of them. He was like a "getting on base machine" in the rookie league. Today, he has moved up to Single-A minor league.</p>
            <p>News spread on American social media today that Ke Jing-hsien, a Taiwanese outfielder from the Dodgers' rookie league, has moved up to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, a Single-A team. CNA reporters contacted Ke Jing-hsien, and he confirmed this news.</p>
            <p>Ke Jing-hsien started his first professional season this year in the rookie league. The games were held at the spring training base in Phoenix, Arizona. Now that he has moved up to Single-A, he will go to Southern California on July 25 to join the Dodgers' Single-A team.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers' Single-A Quakes team plays at home east of Los Angeles. It is about an hour's drive from the Dodgers' main league stadium.</p>
            <p>Ke Jing-hsien played 52 games in the rookie league. What was most impressive was his amazing ability to get on base. He got on base in almost every game. Out of 52 games, there were only 2 games where he did not reach first base. In one of those games, he had to leave in the first inning and did not get a chance to bat.</p>
            <p>The rookie league season started in May. In these three months, Ke Jing-hsien played 52 games. He hit 66 times in 180 at-bats. His batting average was 0.367, his on-base percentage was 0.487, and his slugging percentage was 0.539. His OPS (On-base Plus Slugging) was 1.026.</p>
            <p>Among his 66 hits, he had 15 doubles, 2 triples, and 4 home runs. This shows his excellent power-hitting ability. He was first in both on-base percentage and OPS in the Arizona Complex League (ACL).</p>
            <p>This week, the Dodgers' Single-A Quakes team will play against the Arizona Diamondbacks' Single-A Rawhide team at home. The Rawhide team also has a Taiwanese pitcher, Huang Chung-hsiang, who just moved up from the rookie league. Huang Chung-hsiang is expected to pitch on July 26. This means there might be a match-up between these two good Taiwanese players, a pitcher and a batter. (Edited by Chen Cheng-kung) July 25, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Swiss People Drink Less for Health; Food and Drink Businesses Change Strategies</h1>
            <p>Zurich, July 25 (CNA) A new study in Switzerland shows that fewer young people are drinking alcohol. Among people aged 16 and older, 8% do not drink alcohol at all, and 9% have started to stop drinking. More women are quitting alcohol than men, by 4 to 5 percent. The group most actively quitting drinking is aged 31 to 54. This drop in drinking is affecting restaurants and bars, so they are changing how they do business.</p>
            <p>A survey this summer by the Swiss online media "Watson" shows the top three reasons why young people are drinking less: alcohol is not good for health, they simply don't want to drink, and they worry about losing control after drinking. The higher price of alcoholic drinks is also a reason for less drinking.</p>
            <p>Regarding this trend, the Swiss Addiction Aid St. Gallen (Suchthilfe St. Gallen) told Swiss Radio and Television (SRF) that over the past 25 years, Swiss society has become more aware of health. This has led more young people to choose not to drink alcohol.</p>
            <p>However, the foundation also noted that even though young people control themselves on most days, some still choose to "break the rules" and drink a lot at summer outdoor parties. They say, "We limit ourselves usually, but we enjoy ourselves fully when we party."</p>
            <p>In Europe, drinking together is part of social life. Having a drink in hand at gatherings often helps improve the mood. But, the amount of alcohol young Swiss people drink is falling year by year. This is a warning sign for restaurants and bars, as it could mean less money for them.</p>
            <p>Business owners interviewed said that to deal with these market changes, they will focus on creating a happy atmosphere, offering good prices, making outdoor dining areas bigger, giving friendly service, and providing more non-alcoholic drinks. Also, considering public safety by not driving after drinking, providing safe public transport options will also help attract more customers.</p>
            <p>Switzerland started its busy outdoor season in June. Outdoor music festivals are happening everywhere, and beer companies are setting up stands. Industry experts say that the hotter the weather, the more people like to go outside, and sales are better. Alcoholic drinks play an important part in summer fun and have become a popular topic in Swiss society. (Edited by Tang Sheng-yang) July 25, 2025.
