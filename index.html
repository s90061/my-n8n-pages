            <h1>Russia and Ukraine Exchange Prisoners Before Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine announced today that they each exchanged 84 prisoners of war. This is the newest exchange in a series of prisoner exchanges this year. Hundreds of people have been set free in these exchanges.</p>
            <p>The exchange happened before the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump. Their meeting is planned for August 15 in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media that the exchanged prisoners included "soldiers and also civilians." Some of them, he said, "have been held by the Russians since 2014, 2016, and 2017."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that "people who bravely defended Mariupol" were part of this exchange. Mariupol is a port city in Ukraine. Russian forces surrounded it for almost three months in February 2022 before taking control of it.</p>
            <p>The Russian Ministry of Defense stated on Telegram that the United Arab Emirates helped with this prisoner exchange. The Russian people who were released are now receiving "mental and medical help."</p>
            <p>Big prisoner exchanges were the only real good result from three peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. These talks took place in Istanbul from May to July.</p>
            <p>In the most recent talks last month, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange 1200 prisoners from each side.</p>
            <p>A Russian negotiator said that Moscow also offered to give back the bodies of 3000 soldiers who died to Kyiv.</p>

            <p>Before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump spoke in an interview. He said that if his meeting with Putin did not go well, he would not call anyone.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to Fox News Radio today. He said that if his meeting with Putin is successful, he will call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders. However, he also said that there is a 25% chance his meeting with Putin will not be successful.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that if the meeting with Putin is successful, there will be a second meeting. This second meeting would include Putin and Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Trump said that any agreement to stop Russia's actions in Ukraine would be made at this second meeting with all three leaders. He stressed that it would not happen at the summit in Alaska tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Trump strongly stated, "The second meeting will be very, very important, because that is when they will make an agreement."</p>
            <p>Putin and Trump are scheduled to meet in Alaska, USA, at 11:30 AM local time on August 15. This will be 3:30 AM on August 16 in Taiwan.</p>
