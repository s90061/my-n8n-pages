Analysts are now predicting that Nvidia, a leading chipmaker, could grow into a nearly $5 trillion company. This follows a significant increase in their price targets. For example, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann recently raised his price target for Nvidia from $140 to $200, which is the highest on Wall Street. This positive outlook is largely due to the company's strong performance and its dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.

Barclays analysts also increased their price target for Nvidia to $200, expecting the stock to rise by another 38%. They are optimistic about the company's progress with its Blackwell AI platform and the upcoming release of its Ultra chips. They believe that increased shipments of Blackwell and Ultra chips will help improve Nvidia's gross profit margins in the second half of the year. Jefferies analysts agree, stating that as the main supplier of AI accelerators in data centers, Nvidia's Blackwell rollout should boost its gross margin from the low 70% range to the targeted mid-70% range. Many believe that reaching a $5 trillion valuation is only a matter of time, given Nvidia's record earnings and its advantage as a pioneer in AI technology.

**The Simple Water Gun Becomes a Symbol of Barcelona's Anti-Tourism Movement**

In Barcelona, Spain, the humble and inexpensive plastic water gun has unexpectedly become a powerful symbol of the city's anti-tourism protests. The movement began to gain attention when a woman, using a simple water gun, sprayed an arc of water at a group of tourists enjoying drinks at an outdoor table.

This act, and the use of water guns in general, is becoming increasingly common in anti-tourism demonstrations across Spain, where many locals feel the negative effects of overtourism. While not all protesters carry water guns, and some only spray water into the air or at each other, the image of the water gun has resonated as a quiet but direct form of protest against the overwhelming number of tourists. This unique approach highlights the frustration of residents who are struggling with issues like rising housing costs, crowded public spaces, and the impact of tourism on their daily lives.
