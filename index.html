            <h1>US Manufacturers Who Make Goods Abroad "Stop Production" Because of Trump's Tariffs</h1>
            <p>When US President Trump announced new taxes on almost all countries he trades with in April, a business owner from Pennsylvania named Ben Knepler contacted his factory in Cambodia. This factory makes outdoor furniture for his company. He told them to "stop production" because his company had already moved its production overseas.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Trump's announcement included a 10% tax on goods coming from most trading partners. For many countries, he planned even higher taxes. For example, Trump planned a tax of up to 49% for goods from Cambodia.</p>
            <p>Knepler told news reporters, "That evening, we told our factory that with such high taxes, we really couldn't afford to sell our products in the United States."</p>
            <p>During Trump's first time as president, he put taxes on goods from China. So, Knepler's company, True Places, which is in Pennsylvania, moved its outdoor chair production from China to Cambodia. For Knepler and his company, this new decision is much harder.</p>
            <p>He remembered, "At that time, we faced a 25% tax in China, but zero tax in Cambodia."</p>
            <p>It took the company one year to move its large machines and molds to Cambodia. Now, they face high taxes again.</p>
            <p>Trump's "equal" taxes started on August 7th. The tax on outdoor chairs made in Cambodia for Knepler's factory went down from the first planned 49% to 19%. But this is still a lot more than before.</p>
            <p>For many years, US companies that make things like yo-yos and clothes moved their production to other countries. Knepler's experience shows what many US companies that moved their production abroad are going through.</p>
            <p>To stay in business, US companies have to find different ways to deal with this.</p>
            <p>Some companies add the new costs to the price for customers. Others stop bringing in goods when taxes are too high. They hope that Trump will make a trade deal that helps their businesses start again.</p>
            <p>Trump says that other countries pay for his taxes and that the US will collect tens of billions of dollars in taxes this year. But businesses do not agree.</p>
            <p>Knepler said, "When goods enter the US, we pay the taxes. No one else pays those taxes before the goods are sold."</p>
            <p>Experts in economics warn that these taxes could cause prices to rise and slow down economic growth.</p>
            <p>Trump says that his taxes have only had a small effect on prices in the US so far. However, experts say that the effect of the taxes on customers will take some time to be seen.</p>

            <h1>No Sharing of Recall Polls from August 13th; No Campaigning on Voting Day, August 23rd</h1>
            <p>The Central Election Commission (CEC) said today that it is against the law to share or talk about recall polls from 12:00 AM today until 4:00 PM on August 23rd, when voting ends. This is because seven Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers are facing recall votes, and there will also be a national public vote on restarting the Hsieh-ho nuclear power plant. Both votes will happen on August 23rd. On the day of the recall vote, there can also be no campaigning or any activities to help or stop the recall.</p>
            <p>The CEC stated that while there are no similar rules for public vote polls, it is still not allowed to use public vote polls to also promote the recall on voting day.</p>
            <p>The KMT lawmakers facing recall votes are Luo Ming-tsai, Chiang Chi-chen, Yang Chiung-ying, Yen Kuan-heng, Lin Szu-ming, Ma Wen-chun, and Yu Hao. The votes for their recall and the national public vote on restarting Hsieh-ho nuclear power plant will be held on August 23rd.</p>
            <p>The CEC explained today that the rules for polls are different for public official elections and public votes. According to Article 53 of the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, political parties and anyone else cannot publish, report, share, talk about, or use recall opinion polls or any similar information from 10 days before the voting day until the voting period ends.</p>
            <p>The CEC said that this means, by law, from 12:00 AM today until 4:00 PM on August 23rd, when voting ends, no political party or person can publish, share, or talk about polls. On the day of the recall vote, there can also be no campaigning for or against the recall.</p>
            <p>The CEC pointed out that if someone breaks these rules, they will be fined between NT$100,000 and NT$1,000,000 according to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act. If a political party, the main person asking for the recall, the person being recalled, or their employees, agents, or users break the rules, the fine will be higher, between NT$200,000 and NT$2,000,000.</p>
            <p>Regarding public vote polls, the CEC said that while the Referendum Act does not have clear rules like the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, when a public vote and a recall are held together, it is still not allowed to use public vote polls to also promote the recall on voting day.</p>
            <p>Also, the CEC previously shared on Facebook that on August 23rd, it is not allowed to wear or carry any words, symbols, or pictures related to the public vote, such as stickers, clothes, or accessories. It is also not allowed to make noise or bother other voters. It is also not allowed to tell others to vote or not to vote. If someone breaks these rules, they could face up to 2 years in prison, detention, or a fine of up to NT$200,000.</p>
            <p>The CEC said that if there are any reports of rule-breaking on August 23rd, the election office will investigate them as required by law.</p>
