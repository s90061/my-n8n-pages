            <h1>Hsinchu City Dog "Zongzong" Sent to Shelter Awaiting Adoption; Lin Chih-chien: Indeed Not Thorough Enough</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Lu Gang-jun, Hsinchu City, July 30) The former Hsinchu City dog "Zongzong" was sent to an animal shelter in 2021 because it bit someone. It is still waiting for adoption, and people are saying the city government abandoned it. Former Hsinchu Mayor Lin Chih-chien said that not following up was truly not good enough. He will try his best to find a suitable home for the dog.</p>
            <p>Recently, some people wrote on social media that the city dog Zongzong, adopted by the Hsinchu City government in 2020, was abandoned and sent back to the shelter in 2021. This caused many discussions online.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-chien wrote on Facebook today that people who want to adopt Zongzong went to the animal protection office with a city council member. They had an interview, learned about care lessons, and spent time with Zongzong. The office plans to visit Zongzong's future home next week. They hope that after a professional check, Zongzong can find a new family soon.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-chien said he truly apologized to people who care about Zongzong and animal protection. He explained that Zongzong did not get used to its new home at first and bit some people visiting the office. The animal protection office thought training could help Zongzong feel less stressed. However, he and the city government team did not keep checking on the dog. He admitted this was not careful enough. Now, they will try their very best to quickly find a good home for Zongzong.</p>
            <p>Hsinchu City government released a press statement yesterday. It said that Zongzong was a stray dog. In 2018, people reported it, and it was caught and taken to the shelter. At that time, Zongzong was about 7 years old, strong, lively, and friendly. It was chosen to be the shelter's public relations dog. It also helped with filming for promoting animal protection in Hsinchu. In 2020, it was chosen to be the city government's dog and lived under a big tree in the city hall garden.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu City government said that at first, Zongzong was very friendly with city staff and visitors. People took turns feeding it and cleaning its area. But in April 2021, the former city government team sent Zongzong back to the animal shelter. They did this because Zongzong lived in an open area, and not everyone knew how to act around animals. Also, Zongzong unfortunately bit a person and a reporter. They decided to send it back for safety and the dog's well-being.</p>
            <p>The city government said that Zongzong is still at the Hsinchu City animal shelter. Caretakers look after it, and volunteers help walk it, exercise it, and cut its fur. Zongzong is still available for adoption. (Edited by Fang Pei-ching) July 30, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Might Not Attend G20 Summit in South Africa in November</h1>
            <p>(Washington, July 29, Comprehensive Foreign Report by CNA) U.S. President Trump said today that he might not go to the G20 leaders' meeting in South Africa in November. Instead, he might send someone else to represent the U.S. He said this is because he does not agree with South Africa's policies.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump told reporters on Air Force One, his presidential plane, "I think I might send someone else, because I have many problems with South Africa. They have some very bad policies."</p>
            <p>Trump has criticized South Africa's policies both inside and outside the country. This includes South Africa's land policy and its accusation that Israel, a U.S. ally, has committed genocide in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>In February, Trump signed an order to cut financial help from the U.S. to South Africa. In May, when he met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House, Trump also spoke about false claims, like white genocide and land seizures.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also did not attend the G20 foreign ministers' meeting in South Africa. South Africa is the current chair of the G20. Its term started in December last year and ends in November this year. (Translator: Lu Ying-tzu/Proofreader: Li Pei-shan) July 30, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Multiple Forest Fires in Portugal; 2,700 Firefighters Involved</h1>
            <p>(Lisbon, July 29, Comprehensive Foreign Report by CNA) Almost 2,700 firefighters today worked hard to stop forest fires in different parts of Portugal. These fires have made almost the whole country be on high alert.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that there are 17 big fires in Portugal, especially in the central and northern areas.</p>
            <p>About 750 firefighters are trying to control a fire in a eucalyptus forest in Arouca, a town in central Portugal.</p>
            <p>Mario Silvestre, the head of Portugal's civil defense agency, said at a press conference, "Right now, we are putting all our effort and help into putting out this fire."</p>
            <p>Hundreds of other firefighters are fighting fires near Penamacor, a town in central Portugal, and in the mountains near Ponte da Barca, which is close to the border with Spain in the north.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, four water-carrying planes from Spain joined the effort to fight the fires.</p>
            <p>After visiting the national emergency services office, Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said, "We are in a difficult time."</p>
            <p>Civil defense officials said that a total of 26 firefighting planes are working in the sky. About 20 people, including 14 firefighters, received medical care for minor injuries.</p>
            <p>Based on early information, the Ponte da Barca fire, which started on July 26, made some people move to a local church. This fire has burned almost 2,000 hectares of land.</p>
            <p>Authorities said that because of the high temperatures, the fires might get worse in the coming days. (Translator: Cheng Shih-yun/Proofreader: Hsu Jui-cheng) July 30, 2025.</p>
