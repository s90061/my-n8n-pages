            <h1>Global Talks on Plastic Pollution Treaty Extended to August 15th to Solve Differences</h1>
            <p>Talks aimed at creating the world's first legally binding agreement to stop plastic pollution went into extra time today. The meeting decided to continue until tomorrow, August 15th.</p>
            <p>Reports from Reuters and AFP said that countries were supposed to finish their talks today at the United Nations office in Geneva. They were trying to agree on how strict future rules should be.</p>
            <p>But with only 30 minutes left before the meeting was supposed to end, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the head of the International Negotiating Committee (INC), told the people there that talks would go on until tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Before closing the meeting, Valdivieso said, "Because our talks on the changed draft are still happening, this full meeting will continue and will meet again on August 15, 2025. The exact time will be announced later."</p>
            <p>The International Negotiating Committee (INC) was started by the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) in 2022. Its job is to create a global agreement that must be followed by law to deal with plastic pollution.</p>
            <p>Plastic pollution is everywhere. Very tiny pieces of plastic have been found on the highest mountains, in the deepest parts of the ocean, and almost in every part of the human body.</p>
            <p>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), if things do not change, the amount of new plastic made from oil will almost triple by 2060, reaching 1.2 billion tons. And waste will be more than 1 billion tons. This will harm the oceans even more, hurt our health, and make climate change worse.</p>
            <p>Countries like Panama, Kenya, the United Kingdom, and the European Union (EU) are unhappy because important parts of the draft agreement were completely removed. These parts were about the whole life of plastic, from when it is made to when it is thrown away, and its dangers to health.</p>
            <p>Countries that produce oil do not want limits on making new plastic from oil, coal, and natural gas. Other countries want to limit it and have stricter rules for plastic products and dangerous chemicals.</p>
            <p>Jessika Roswall, the EU Environment Commissioner, said that a "weak, strict agreement is not good for anyone."</p>
            <p>She said in a statement: "An agreement that covers the entire life of plastic, and can get better as science improves, is a very important step... The next few hours will show if we can use this chance well."</p>

            <h1>During World War II Battles in the Philippines, Taiwanese Soldiers and Chinese Filipinos Helped Each Other and Became Friends</h1>
            <p>During World War II, when Japanese soldiers entered the Philippines, many Taiwanese people were made to join the army. At the start of the war, they fought, but later, they mostly did labor work. They left their mark in this foreign country. Some Taiwanese soldiers also became close friends with Chinese Filipinos by helping each other.</p>
            <p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces began to attack the Philippines. On December 10, 1941, the Japanese 48th Division's motorized troops landed in several places on Luzon Island. They were the first group before a bigger attack by Japanese forces on December 22.</p>
            <p>Anthony Feredo, a historian of World War II in the Philippines, told CNA that two units of the Japanese 48th Division were made up of Taiwanese soldiers led by Japanese officers. These units were called the 1st Formosa Regiment and the 2nd Formosa Regiment.</p>
            <p>Feredo, who has written many books about World War II, said that the Philippines was a very important place for military plans. The Japanese army used the Philippines as a starting point to attack Southeast Asia and other Pacific islands. They gathered soldiers there, healed injured soldiers, and got resources like food, fuel, and minerals from the Philippines.</p>
            <p>In the same way, the American army also used the Philippines as an important starting point when they fought back. They kept as many as 300,000 Japanese soldiers in the Philippines, which stopped them from going back to Japan to fight.</p>
            <p>Feredo said, based on old records, that on December 26 of the same year, the American army lost and said Manila was an "open city," meaning it would not be defended. Taiwanese soldiers were among the first Japanese troops to enter Manila. In the Chinese area, people heard Japanese soldiers giving orders to Chinese Filipinos in Chinese, or looking for Chinese guerrilla members who might have helped fight against Japan.</p>
            <p>The Japanese 48th Division left Luzon Island in January 1942 and went to Indonesia to fight against Dutch forces. They did not take part in the very fierce Bataan Peninsula battle in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Later in the war, most Taiwanese people sent to the Philippines were laborers. They worked as farm workers, loaders, and dock workers, helping with the Japanese army's supplies. But a small number of Taiwanese soldiers still fought. For example, in November and December 1944, Japanese paratroopers fought the last paratrooper battle with American forces on Leyte Island. The main group in this fight was the "Takasago Volunteer Unit," made up of indigenous people from Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Feredo said that after the combined forces of the Philippines and America fought back, Japanese soldiers ran away into the mountains. Many Taiwanese-Japanese soldiers were left behind and surrendered. For example, at the Manila dock, there were at least 150, and in southern Luzon, about 200 to 300 surrendered.</p>
            <p>He said that during the war, soldiers also had no choice but to follow orders. Old writings do not say that Filipinos hated Taiwanese-Japanese soldiers. Instead, they even felt sorry for them, because some Taiwanese who worked for the Japanese army were killed by Japanese forces, either because there was not enough food or they got sick.</p>
            <p>When asked about what we can learn from the war, Feredo said that war seems exciting when you read about it in books, but real war is very different. Countries should solve their disagreements by talking, not by fighting.</p>
            <p>He said, "I had two uncles who fought in the war, and only one lived. Even though he sometimes didn't want to admit it, in the last days of his life, I could see the pain from the war in his eyes."</p>
            <p>On another note, many years ago, a reporter spoke to a Chinese Filipino who lived through World War II. He said that a Taiwanese-Japanese soldier once caught a Chinese Filipino giving out flyers against Japan. The soldier only whispered, "Aren't you afraid to die!" and then told him to leave quickly.</p>
            <p>The former secretary-general of the "Philippine Chinese Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army," Zhuang Zhen-dang, told CNA that after the Japanese army was defeated, they planned to leave. Some Taiwanese soldiers were left behind. Filipino guerrilla groups searched for and killed the remaining Japanese soldiers, and Taiwanese soldiers also became targets.</p>
            <p>He said that luckily, Taiwanese soldiers often secretly helped Chinese Filipinos who were captured by Japanese forces because they spoke the same language. For example, they stopped Japanese soldiers from hurting them or took care of Chinese Filipinos who were in prison. So, after the war, Chinese Filipino groups who fought against Japan took in Taiwanese soldiers, over 70 of them, and helped them return to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He said that because of this friendship, many Taiwanese soldiers stayed in touch with Chinese Filipinos by writing letters after they went back to Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>During Ghost Festival, Freight Transport Increases; Freeway Bureau Says: Keep Distance from Big Trucks on Highways</h1>
            <p>Because of the Mid-year Ghost Festival in the 7th month of the lunar calendar, there has been more demand for freight transport recently. The Freeway Bureau said today that large vehicles are big and heavy, and they are not as easy to control as small cars. They remind drivers of small cars to keep a safe distance from big trucks when driving on highways.</p>
            <p>As it is now the middle of the 6th lunar month, the need for freight transport on the roads has gone up because of the Mid-year Ghost Festival in the 7th lunar month. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Freeway Bureau released a statement to tell drivers of small cars three important things to do when they are near large vehicles on the highway.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau advises drivers to avoid driving between two large vehicles. If you find yourself in this situation, you should make sure to keep enough space from the cars in front of and behind you. Also, change lanes quickly to move away from the large vehicles. If you cannot move right away because there are too many cars, you can turn on your hazard lights to tell the large vehicle behind you to keep its distance.</p>
            <p>If a large vehicle is driving very close behind you, the Freeway Bureau suggests that you can speed up to create more distance or move to another lane. This will make it less likely for you to be hit from behind.</p>
            <p>When there is a large vehicle in front of you, the Freeway Bureau says your view might be blocked. So, you should keep a longer distance behind it. This will give you enough time to react if something happens suddenly.</p>
