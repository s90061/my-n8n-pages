            <h1>New Children's Health Check-up System One Year Old: Many Parents Don't Know About It</h1>
            <p>A new system that offers 6 extra free health check-ups for children has been active for one year. A survey shows that 52.2% of parents do not know about this free service from the government. The National Health Agency asks parents to get regular check-ups. If problems with a child's development are found early, help can be given, and the problems can get better or even go away.</p>
            <p>Since July 2024, the National Health Agency has offered more health check-ups for children. All children under 7 years old can get 6 free check-ups at certain times. Doctors who specialize in young children and are trained to use special tools will do these checks. They will observe the child, ask parents or caregivers about the child's behavior at home, and use their medical knowledge to give a full and professional check-up.</p>
            <p>These check-ups can find problems early in how children grow. This includes problems with talking, thinking, moving, or being with others. Parents will get advice, follow-up help, or be sent to experts for more detailed checks if needed.</p>
            <p>However, a survey by the National Health Agency this year found that 52.2% of parents do not know the government provides these 6 free check-ups for children's development.</p>
            <p>Ms. Shen Jing-Fen, head of the National Health Agency, said that besides the 6 development check-ups, parents should also remember the 7 child health check-ups. Parents can use a total of 13 free check-ups before their child turns 7. These checks help parents understand their child's health and development. If there are any problems or possible issues, a team of experts can give help early, offering health advice and professional suggestions at the right time.</p>
            <p>Dr. Xu Kai-Xiang, a doctor specializing in newborns at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, shared a story. He once helped a 2-month-old baby during a regular child health check-up. This baby was not gaining weight well, had trouble feeding, and found it hard to breathe. The baby's weight was only 500 grams more than at birth, which was much lower than other babies of the same age. Further checks found a heart murmur. The baby was diagnosed with a complex heart problem present since birth. Surgery was quickly planned, and after the operation, the baby slowly got better.</p>
            <p>The 7 child health check-ups happen at these times: from birth to 2 months, 2 to 4 months, 4 to 10 months, 10 months to 1.5 years, 1.5 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, and 3 years to under 7 years. These checks include looking at the child's body, checking their development, and giving health advice. Recent numbers show that over 80% of parents have used these 7 check-ups in the last three years.</p>

            <h1>Two Elderly People Rescued After Getting Lost While Hiking in Keelung's Qidu Area</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a 78-year-old man, Mr. Chen, and a 73-year-old woman, Ms. Lin, went hiking in the Qidu area of Keelung City and got lost. The fire department received a call for help and sent 4 vehicles and 25 people. After the rescue team gathered, they went into the mountains to search. They found the two people on the ridge of Xiandonghu Mountain. Luckily, both were fine and not seriously hurt.</p>
            <p>The Keelung City Fire Department said today that they received a call around 10 AM yesterday. The call said that two people from Taipei, both about 70 years old, were lost in the mountains. The two started their hike from the Guniang Temple entrance on Huaxin 1st Road in Qidu. After walking for about an hour, they got lost because they didn't know the path well. They were stuck on a mountain ridge and asked for help to get down.</p>
            <p>The fire department immediately sent 4 vehicles and 25 people from the Qidu and Baifu teams to help find them. They set up a command center at Guniang Temple. After the rescue workers met, they used the location information given by the person who called for help. They believed the lost people were on the ridge of Xiandonghu Mountain. After walking into the mountains for about 30 minutes, they reached the ridge and found the two people. Checks showed that both were awake and healthy. After that, they were safely brought down the mountain.</p>
            <p>The head of the Keelung City Fire Department, You Jia-Yi, asked people who go hiking to always think about how fit they are. He also asked them to bring all the necessary gear and always pay attention to the weather and the path. Do not ignore the dangers of hiking. This is important to stay safe during your trip.</p>

            <h1>Blue Party Says Fund Paid Director, Ministry of Labor Asks Not to Link Wrongly</h1>
            <p>Ling Tao, the deputy head of the Kuomintang (KMT) think tank, said today that the Employment Stabilization Fund gave over NT$28.72 million to director Luo Jing-Ren's team for "Zero Day Attack" between 2022 and 2024. He stated this money was not used for the right purpose of the fund, calling it a serious problem and clearly against the law.</p>
            <p>In response, the Ministry of Labor stated clearly that it did not give money for any plans related to filming "Zero Day Attack." The Ministry also said that all its work for promoting labor issues follows laws and rules and is not political. They asked people with bad intentions not to make wrong connections or hints.</p>
            <p>Also, regarding a full review of how the Employment Stabilization Fund is managed, the Ministry of Labor said they already explained everything to the parliament and the National Audit Office in March this year. They also said they will continue to carry out plans to improve things.</p>
            <p>The KMT held a press conference this morning. Kang Jin-Yu, the deputy spokesperson, said that according to a report by the National Audit Office, the Employment Stabilization Fund might have become a "Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officials and supporters' fund." The Audit Office looked into how the Ministry of Labor and its related groups used money from the Employment Stabilization Fund. They found that over NT$51.74 million was spent in three years in ways that did not match the fund's purpose or rules for its use.</p>
            <p>Kang Jin-Yu said the Ministry of Labor used this money for making and promoting media, concerts, music videos, and music nights. They also used it for managing the Ministry of Labor's Facebook page, making spring couplets and red envelopes, and even buying gifts for the Minister during holidays.</p>
            <p>Ling Tao said that the Employment Stabilization Fund was used not only for two dresses and a concert for former Minister of Labor Xu Ming-Chun, but also to support director Luo Jing-Ren's team for "Zero Day Attack." This included over NT$10.69 million in 2022 for making and promoting the Labor Day theme video "A-Fang's Laundry." However, this video only got 488 likes.</p>
            <p>Ling Tao added that in 2023, the Labor Day theme video and media promotion for "2023 Labor Day Theme Video - Paper Craft Chapter" cost over NT$9.71 million but only received 1761 likes. In 2024, they continued to make and promote the Labor Day theme video "2024 Long Live Labor - Moving Chapter," which cost over NT$8.31 million and only got 202 likes.</p>
            <p>Ling Tao stressed that Luo Jing-Ren's team received a total of NT$28,726,914. This is about 55.51% of the NT$51,744,288 spent not for the right purpose. This has made other good art and culture groups wonder why all the money went to Luo Jing-Ren's team. He said this money does not match the purpose of the Employment Stabilization Fund at all, calling it a serious misuse of funds and clearly against the law. He questioned if the Executive Yuan would allow the DPP's "green friends" to continue doing this.</p>
