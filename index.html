The Art Pressed Flower Club from National Open University, Taichung Learning Center, is holding an exhibition called "A Dialogue Between Flowers and Leaves - Art Pressed Flower Exhibition." It's at the Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital, on the first basement floor, in the corner art area. There are 51 artworks, showing how special pressed flowers can be.

Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital announced today that the exhibition will be open until August 28th. The 51 artworks use layers of flowers, leaves, and plants. They show different scenes like mountains, fields, animals, and even the underwater world.

The teacher, Chou You-chun, said that the exhibition has many different kinds of works. Dried flowers, leaves, and plants are used to create beautiful pieces. They are very detailed, just like a painting.

Li Bo-ren, the vice president of Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital, said that the artworks change what people usually think about pressed flowers. Even the rich underwater life is shown clearly through the flowers and plants used by the artists.

**Typhoon Dianmu Causes Damage: Soldiers Help with Disaster Relief While Exercising**

Today is the third day of Taiwan's "Han Kuang No. 41" military exercise. Because Typhoon Dianmu caused floods in many areas in the south, soldiers from the Fourth Combat Zone, who protect the south, are helping with disaster relief in addition to their training.

The Fourth Combat Zone said that even though Typhoon Dianmu has passed, the heavy rain caused bad floods in the south. To help local governments, the Fourth Combat Zone is still checking its available soldiers and equipment during the Han Kuang exercise. They are helping farmers in Tainan pick up fallen fruits and clear roads.

The Fourth Combat Zone stressed that the soldiers are working hard to help people, even in the bad weather. They are working with local communities to quickly clean up and fix things. They hope people can return to their normal lives soon.

**Former Army Captain Gets Suspended Sentence for Forging Ammunition Forms**

A former Army Captain named Chang, who worked as an ammunition officer in the 206th Infantry Brigade, was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison. However, he received a 3-year suspended sentence because he secretly made stamps of the logistics chief and the brigade commander. He used them to fake 99 ammunition movement forms. He was caught and sent to court.

The Hsinchu District Court's judgment said that Chang left the army on January 1st this year. While he was working, he was in charge of checking "ammunition forms," which are official documents. He was a public servant with the power to do this job by law.

The judgment explained that Chang made fake stamps of the brigade commander and the logistics chief for ammunition work. Starting last August, he used these fake stamps on ammunition forms. Then, he gave them to people who didn't know they were fake, who then gave them to shooting range supervisors. Later, when the chief's stamp went missing and they started using signatures instead, they found out Chang had been using fake stamps. They reported it for investigation.

The judge considered that Chang knew that when military personnel needed ammunition for shooting practice, the unit staff should fill out the "ammunition form" correctly. Then, the form should be sent to the unit head and Chang for approval. After that, Chang should get approval from his superiors step by step to complete the request.

The judge said that Chang did not follow the rules and laws. He took shortcuts and made fake ammunition stamps, which harmed the correct management of ammunition in the army. So, for making fake official documents, he was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison with a 3-year suspended sentence. He also has to pay NT$40,000 to the public treasury and attend two legal education classes. He will be under probation during the suspended sentence. This decision can be appealed.
