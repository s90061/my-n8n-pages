            <h1>EU to Pass 18th Round of Sanctions on Russia, Considers Suspending Georgia's Visa-Free Travel</h1>
            <p>(Brussels, Central News Agency, July 15) Kaja Kallas, who is a top official for foreign affairs and security in the European Union (EU), said today that the EU is almost ready to agree on new penalties against Russia. She also warned that Georgia's citizens might lose their right to travel to the EU without a visa. This is because the Georgian government is stopping people from speaking freely and "democracy is going backward" in the country.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Kallas spoke before a meeting of EU foreign ministers today. She said, "We want to agree on the 18th set of penalties for Russia. We are very, very close to finishing it, and I hope we can do it today."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse also shared that Kallas stated, "Today, we will also send a letter to Georgia about their visa-free travel. They need to meet certain conditions. If they don't meet these conditions by a set date, we will stop their visa-free travel."</p>
            <p>Kallas did not say exactly when Georgia needs to meet these conditions.</p>
            <p>The EU says that Georgia, a country in the South Caucasus, has been putting many opposition politicians, activists, and reporters who criticize the ruling party in jail.</p>
            <p>The EU believes that what the Georgian government is doing, and the laws that stop people from speaking freely, have pushed Georgia off its path to joining the EU. Georgia has wanted to join the EU for a long time.</p>
            <p>The EU is trying to take action against Georgia. They even plan to punish judges who send people to prison for disagreeing with the government. But Hungary, which is a friend of Georgia's ruling party called "Georgian Dream," does not agree with these plans. This makes it hard for the EU to punish Georgia.</p>
            <p>In 2017, people from Georgia were allowed to travel to the EU's Schengen area without needing a visa. This was seen as one of the most important steps Georgia made to become closer to the EU.</p>

            <h1>Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng Defeat World No. 9 Men's Doubles Pair, Advance to Round of 16 at Japan Badminton Open</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, Central News Agency, July 15) Taiwan's male badminton players, Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng, won a surprising match today. They beat Indonesia's pair, Maulana and Carnando, who are ranked 9th in the world. The scores were 21-15 and 21-19. This win puts them into the top 16 at the BWF Super 750 Japan Open.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng are called the "cold wave pair" from Taiwan and are ranked 24th in the world. Before this game, they had played against Indonesia's Bagas Maulana and Leo Rolly Carnando once this year. That was at the Asian Championships, where the Taiwanese pair lost in two straight games.</p>
            <p>Today, when these two teams played again, Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng were ready. They led the first game from the beginning. Even though the Indonesian team caught up to 11-11 in the middle of the game, the Taiwanese pair then quickly scored 6 points in a row. They did this by moving well and hitting flat shots very effectively. This helped them get a big lead and win the first game easily.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng were behind for most of the time. But when they caught up from 14-16 to make it a tie, they felt much more confident. At 18-18, Liu Kuang-heng made a strong smash and they got two more points. This gave them two chances to win the match at 20-18. They then won the game and the match without losing a set, which was their goal, and they got their revenge.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng have played 11 games this year. Their best result so far was reaching the top 8 at the All England Open. Now that they are in the top 16, their next game will be against Liu Yi and Chen Po-yang from China.</p>
            <p>Two other Taiwanese male doubles teams played today, but they did not win. Wang Chi-lin and Chiu Hsiang-chieh lost to Dairi Midorikawa and Kyohei Yamashita from Japan. The scores were 21-17, 16-21, and 19-21. Also, Lee Che-hui and Yang Po-hsuan lost to Rasmus Kjaer and Frederik Soegaard from Denmark with scores of 15-21 and 16-21. Both of these Taiwanese teams were stopped in the first round.</p>
