            <h1>FBI Searches Former Security Advisor Bolton; His Book is Being Investigated for State Secrets</h1>
            <p>On August 22, in New York, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) openly searched the home and office of John Bolton. He was a national security advisor for the White House before. The Justice Department had already started looking into a book Bolton published in 2020. They want to know if he used secret government information in it illegally. There are claims that sensitive information was shared, which has surprised people in American politics.</p>
            <p>John Bolton worked as a national security advisor during Donald Trump's first time as president. He worked for only one year and five months. After he left the White House, Bolton wrote a book called "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir." In this book, he said many critical things about Trump's character and his plans for military and foreign affairs.</p>
            <p>Bolton, who is 76 years old, has often said in public that Trump is not fit to be president. Recently, he criticized a meeting between the US and Russia. He thought that Russian President Vladimir Putin achieved many of his goals, but Trump achieved very little.</p>
            <p>FBI agents took many items and boxes from Bolton's home in Maryland and his office in Washington D.C. US news reports say that the FBI's actions might be part of an investigation into him having and sharing secret information in a wrong way.</p>
            <p>Bolton is an older member of the Republican Party who believes in being conservative and getting involved in other countries' problems. He worked for presidents like Ronald Reagan and both George Bushes (father and son). He was also the US Ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
            <p>He believes the US needs to use its military power in other countries. He wants to change the governments of countries like Iran and North Korea. He supported wars like the one in Iraq and other smaller conflicts. He is known for being tough on China.</p>
            <p>During Trump's first term, he often disagreed with the national security officials from the Republican Party. His staff and cabinet members changed very often. Four people, including Bolton, were national security advisors for the White House during that time.</p>
            <p>In April 2018, Bolton joined the White House when things were messy. He clearly did not get along with Trump, who did not like using the military, on topics like Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan, and Venezuela. At that time, Trump tweeted that he fired Bolton, but Bolton said he resigned. After Trump started his second term, Bolton's security guards were taken away, and his security clearance was also removed recently.</p>
            <p>The investigation is still ongoing to find out if Bolton's 2020 book illegally used secret information from his time as national security advisor, or if he might have shared sensitive secret information with the media.</p>

            <h1>Canada Cancels Many Tariffs on US Goods, Starts September 1</h1>
            <p>On August 22, in Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada will stop adding taxes (tariffs) on some goods from the United States. This will start on September 1. This decision comes after the US also said earlier this month that it would not put tariffs on certain Canadian goods. This move follows the rules of the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that Canada and the US are having more talks about a bigger trade agreement. After talking with US President Trump yesterday, Carney announced today that starting September 1, Canada will "remove all tariffs on US goods" according to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This will make Canada's tariffs the same as the current US tariffs.</p>
            <p>Carney stated that the agreement Canada has with the US right now is "the best among all countries." He also mentioned that countries around the world currently pay an average of 16% in tariffs on goods they send to the US. This is much higher than the 2% average before Trump became president.</p>
            <p>Carney said that the US puts a 5.6% tariff on goods from Canada. However, "85% of our trade is free of tariffs."</p>
            <p>President Trump was very happy about Canada's choice to remove all tariffs on US goods that follow the NAFTA agreement.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters at the White House that the Canadian Prime Minister will "cancel the tariffs that were put in return, and I think that's good." He added, "I like Carney very much, he's a good person, and we had a great talk yesterday."</p>
