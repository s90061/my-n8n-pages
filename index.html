            <h1>Australian Man Drinks on MRT, Insults Another, Both Face Fines</h1>
            <p>An Australian man was drinking a beverage on the Taipei MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) today in the afternoon. A man named Mr. Ke saw this and told him to stop. The Australian man then showed his middle finger to Mr. Ke. Mr. Ke felt angry because of the insult and took out a utility knife. The police said that both men received fines. Mr. Ke will also be sent to court for showing the knife.</p>
            <p>The Sanchong Police Department in New Taipei City explained that the Australian man was on the MRT at 3:15 PM today. When the train was near Xuhui Junior High School Station, he was drinking. Mr. Ke saw this and asked him to stop. However, the Australian man showed his middle finger in response.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ke was unhappy about the rude hand sign. He took out a utility knife he had with him. Other passengers saw this and told the station staff. When the train stopped at Sanhe Junior High School Station, MRT security guards asked both Mr. Ke and the Australian man to get off the train. They were then given to the police.</p>
            <p>The police said that after asking questions, the Australian man received a fine of NT$1500 from the Taipei City Government. This was because he broke the "Mass Rapid Transit Act." Mr. Ke also received a fine of NT$10,000 for breaking the "Mass Rapid Transit Act." Also, because Mr. Ke showed a knife, the police will send his case to the prosecutor's office. He is accused of threatening public safety.</p>

            <h1>France: Prime Minister Tries to Agree on Budget, Unions Call for Big Strike</h1>
            <p>Protests continue in France. Last week, people protested against the government. Now, major worker unions have called for a strike tomorrow. They are protesting against the government's new budget plan. This strike is expected to be bigger and cause more problems. At the same time, Prime Minister SÃ©bastien Lecornu is talking with important political parties. He wants to find a common agreement for the budget plan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lecornu became Prime Minister last week. He immediately showed he wanted to work together. He said the government would not cancel two public holidays. Also, former prime ministers and ministers will no longer receive special benefits for life starting next year. He has also met with and asked for advice from leaders of major unions.</p>
            <p>However, eight main unions, like the CFDT, CGT, and FO, were not convinced. They are still planning a big strike for September 18. They are protesting the government's "harsh" budget plans. They also want fairer taxes and to stop the plan to raise the retirement age to 64.</p>
            <p>Workers are unhappy with the old budget plan. The previous Prime Minister, Francois Bayrou, suggested saving 44 billion euros to reduce the country's debt. He also wanted to remove two public holidays. Because of pressure, Mr. Bayrou asked the parliament to vote if they still trusted him. He lost the vote and resigned to President Emmanuel Macron. Then, Mr. Macron chose Mr. Lecornu as the new Prime Minister. His most important job is to make sure the 2026 budget plan passes.</p>
            <p>Even though Mr. Bayrou is no longer in office, the changes in government have not stopped the public's anger. On September 10, people started a protest called "Bloquons Tout" (Block Everything) on social media. The Ministry of Interior said nearly 200,000 people took part across the country. 473 people were arrested.</p>
            <p>The Minister of Interior, Bruno Retailleau, expects tomorrow's strike to be larger and more intense than last week's. He thinks thousands of people might use the chance to cause trouble, showing hatred towards the police. He said on BFMTV, "Early in the morning, people might block roads and cause damage. There will also be small groups of very violent extreme left-wing people who want to cause trouble."</p>
            <p>This strike will include more types of workers than last week. It is thought that up to 800,000 people might protest across the country. The government will use more than 80,000 police and military personnel for security. They will also use drones, armored vehicles, and water cannons.</p>
            <p>Subway services in the greater Paris area are expected to be very affected. Trains will only run during busy times. The main union for the French national railway company (SNCF) has also asked its members to strike and join the protests. Train services are expected to be very messy.</p>
            <p>For air travel, air traffic controllers' unions have also called for a strike. They want their salaries to increase with inflation. They also want changes in how the industry is managed.</p>
            <p>Pharmacists' unions are against the saving plans suggested by the previous government. One specific plan would reduce their pay for generic medicines. Because of this, they have called for pharmacies to close tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Also, the French electricity company (EDF) has received a strike notice from its unions. The strike will be from 9 PM tonight to 9 PM tomorrow. So, electricity supply might also be affected. The unions want higher salaries and lower energy taxes.</p>
            <p>Before these big public protests, Mr. Lecornu is meeting with important opposition parties. These include the Socialist Party (PS) from the left and the National Rally (RN) from the far-right. All leaders of left-wing parties will meet Mr. Lecornu. Only the far-left "La France Insoumise" (LFI) has refused the invitation.</p>
            <p>For Mr. Lecornu to pass the budget, support from the Socialist Party is very important. However, one condition from the Socialist Party is to create a "Zucman tax." This tax would be at least 2% for very rich people who have more than 100 million euros. The government does not support this idea, saying it is about fair taxes.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Extends Tax Breaks for Electric Cars Until End of 2030</h1>
            <p>Tomorrow, the Executive Yuan will likely approve changes to two laws: the "Commodity Tax Act" and the "Vehicle License Tax Act." These changes will extend the tax exemption for electric vehicles for five more years, until December 31, 2030. This means that people buying electric cars will not have to pay commodity tax or vehicle license tax. It is estimated that this will save taxpayers 9.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars each year.</p>
            <p>In the past, these tax exemptions were usually extended for four years. However, this time, the Ministry of Finance plans to extend them for five years, until the end of 2030. This is to help Taiwan reach its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and make all government policies work together.</p>
            <p>The main point of the proposed change to Article 12-3 of the Commodity Tax Act is to extend the period for not paying commodity tax on electric vehicles by five years, until December 31, 2030. It also removes the rule that allowed the Executive Yuan to decide if the tax exemption period could be extended.</p>
            <p>This means that if you buy an electric vehicle that runs only on electricity and you register it, you will not have to pay commodity tax. However, for electric passenger cars, the tax exemption is only for the tax amount calculated on a price of up to 1.4 million New Taiwan Dollars. If the car costs more than this amount, you will still have to pay tax on the extra amount.</p>
            <p>For the proposed change to Article 5 of the Vehicle License Tax Act, it clearly states that city and county governments can extend the period for not paying vehicle license tax on electric vehicles for five years, until December 31, 2030.</p>
