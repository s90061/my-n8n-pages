            <h1>Yong Feng Yu Group Earns Profit in Second Quarter; Tariffs Have Small Impact Due to Domestic Sales</h1>
            <p>Yong Feng Yu Holdings made a profit in the second quarter. This was because its industrial paper business did very well and kept helping the company's total income. The company's net profit was 73.16 million New Taiwan Dollars. This is a big improvement from the first quarter when they lost 144 million New Taiwan Dollars. So, the company made a profit again, and the profit per share was 0.05 New Taiwan Dollars for this quarter.</p>
            <p>Today, Yong Feng Yu held a meeting to talk about their finances. They talked about how new tariffs from the United States might affect them. Yong Feng Yu said that when the US announced these tariffs in early April, the company quickly started a special team. This team studied how the tariffs might affect the company and its different businesses. They also planned how to check customer risks and how direct and indirect effects might happen.</p>
            <p>The company's own study shows that Yong Feng Yu mainly sells its products in Taiwan. Only about 10% of their sales come from direct or indirect exports to the United States. Also, their customers and industries are not concentrated in areas or industries affected by the tariffs. So, the tariffs will not have a big effect on the whole company.</p>
            <p>However, the world of trade is uncertain. There are new tariffs, changes in money exchange rates, and people are being careful about buying things. Because of this, Yong Feng Yu will keep watching how supply chains change. They will also change their plans as needed to meet customer demands.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Yong Feng Yu will continue to invest in "renewable energy" and "green materials." They will use technology to save energy and reduce carbon. They will also make their production processes fully digital and use AI to manage things smartly. They want to develop valuable green products. All these efforts will help the company grow and earn more money in the future. This will give good value to shareholders who invest for a long time.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Yong Feng Yu released its half-year report. Thanks to the industrial paper business, the company made a profit in the second quarter. But for the first half of the year, the company still had a loss of 71.51 million New Taiwan Dollars. This is not as good as last year when they made a profit of 291 million New Taiwan Dollars. Today, Yong Feng Yu said that the company will keep working on different businesses and products because of the unclear economy. By managing well and changing their plans, they will become more profitable.</p>

            <h1>Sports Agency Offers Summer Camps for Students; Almost 100,000 People Have Joined</h1>
            <p>To help students get into the habit of exercising during summer break, the Sports Administration, a part of the Ministry of Education, started a summer sports and recreation camp program in 2010. Since then, nearly 100,000 students have taken part. This year, they are offering 45 more camps to let students try sports they might not do at school.</p>
            <p>For the 2025 summer sports and recreation camps, the courses are mainly divided into three groups: "Mountain Series," "Water Series," and "Mixed Series." There are over 10 different sports activities. These camps help students train their bodies and minds in different places and with different skills. They also help students develop good exercise habits for life.</p>
            <p>Fang Jui-wen, the Deputy Director of the Sports Administration, said today at a press conference that the summer sports and recreation camps have been running for 16 years. Every year, parents and students really like them. He said, "We mainly plan for sports that are not usually available in schools, like river tracing, paintball, rock climbing, and scuba diving. Many people sign up for these."</p>
            <p>Fang Jui-wen also said that the camps are for students from elementary school to high school. Students from poor families, aboriginal students, new immigrant students, students with disabilities, or students with a BMI (Body Mass Index) above the normal level can join for free.</p>
            <p>Wu Yun-wei, a fourth-grader from Linkou Touhu Elementary School, also spoke at the press conference today. She happily said that she thought archery was interesting after watching it in the Olympics. So she told her mother she wanted to learn it, and this year she specifically signed up for an archery camp.</p>
            <p>Wu Yun-wei said that her school does not have an archery field, so she could not try this sport there. After actually trying it, she found archery very fun. It also helps her learn patience. She has to aim steadily before shooting each arrow. When she hits the center of the target, she feels very proud.</p>

            <h1>Yunlin Principals' Meeting: Han Kuo-yu Hopes They Stick to Their Goals and Help Students</h1>
            <p>The head of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu, took part in the Yunlin County elementary and middle school principals' meeting for the 2025-2026 school year today. He told the principals that he hopes they do not lose themselves while teaching and helping students. He wants them to keep their ideals, beliefs, and passion. He hopes they will help the next generation grow in spirit and gain more knowledge.</p>
            <p>Today, the Yunlin County Government's Education Department held the Yunlin County elementary and middle school principals' meeting for the 2025-2026 school year. The meeting included a special talk on AI teaching, information about workplace accidents in schools, and teachers sharing their experiences. Han Kuo-yu was also invited to have a discussion with the principals about education.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu talked with the principals about common challenges they face. These include differences in how students learn and the school environment. He also hoped that by talking to each other, they could learn from each other. This would help the next generation grow better in their minds and learn more.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that times are changing quickly, and new technology keeps appearing. Young people use technology to get more knowledge and understanding, sometimes even more than older people. There are differences between generations, and these differences affect education. Teachers who work directly with students face many pressures. They not only have to teach but also help students understand difficult things.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu wants the principals not to lose their true selves. He wants them to keep their ideals, beliefs, and passion. When they face challenges and have different choices, he hopes they will choose what is best for everyone.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu suggested that the principals read "The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew." From this book, they can learn how Singapore overcame many difficulties to start its bilingual education policy and plan its future. They can also learn how Singapore stayed balanced between China and the United States, working for the best interests of its own country.</p>
            <p>Also, some government workers at the meeting asked about changes to the pension system and retirement rules. Han Kuo-yu promised that the Legislative Yuan would discuss these matters in the next session.</p>
