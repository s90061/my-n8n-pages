            <h1>Fox News Host Calls for Bombing UN, UN Says Apology Received</h1>
            <p>After former US President Donald Trump had problems with a teleprompter and an escalator at the United Nations headquarters, a Fox News host named Jesse Watters said people should bomb the UN. The spokesperson for the UN, Stephane Dujarric, said today that the UN was shocked by these words.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Dujarric said the UN contacted Fox News about Watters' comments on his show on September 23rd. After that, Watters privately said sorry to Melissa Fleming, who is in charge of global communication for the UN.</p>
            <p>Fox News has not answered questions about this yet.</p>
            <p>Dujarric told reporters today, "Calling for bombing, gas attacks, or destroying this building is not funny and it's not a joke. We cannot accept such comments."</p>
            <p>Watters made these comments about bombing the UN when he was talking about Trump's speech to world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York on September 23rd. Earlier, Trump had complained that an escalator stopped suddenly and a teleprompter did not work shortly after he got on the escalator at the UN headquarters.</p>
            <p>Watters said, "What we should do is either leave the UN or bomb it. Maybe gas it... We must destroy it."</p>
            <p>The UN explained that the escalator that Trump and his wife Melania were using stopped suddenly possibly because a White House photographer accidentally pushed a safety button. About the teleprompter not working, UN officials said that the White House was operating the teleprompter at that time.</p>

            <h1>Trump Government Freezes $4 Billion in Foreign Aid, US Supreme Court Approves</h1>
            <p>Today, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with President Trump's government again. They allowed the government to stop spending about 4 billion US dollars (around 120 billion Taiwan dollars) that Congress had approved for foreign aid this year. This helps Trump's "America First" policy.</p>
            <p>The U.S. government's financial year for 2025 ends on September 30th. This 4 billion dollars was meant for foreign aid, UN peacekeeping work, and helping democracy in other countries.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this case made people wonder how much power a president has to stop money that Congress has approved but that the president does not like. The U.S. Constitution clearly states that Congress controls money matters.</p>
            <p>Aid groups had sued earlier because they disagreed with Trump's government stopping the foreign aid money. A judge in Washington D.C., Amir Ali, then asked Trump's government to spend the money quickly. Today, the Supreme Court approved the Justice Department's request, which stopped Judge Ali's order.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court now has more conservative judges (6 to 3). This year, Trump's government has asked the Supreme Court to step in many times to allow his policies to go forward, especially when lower courts had stopped them. Since Trump came back to the White House in January, the Supreme Court has agreed with his government in almost all the cases they were asked to review.</p>
            <p>In an unsigned order today, the Supreme Court said that the aid groups might not have the legal right to challenge the decision. It also said that if they made a decision against Trump now, it could make his power over foreign policy weaker.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Supreme Court said this urgent order is not the final decision on the case. But it allows the money to be frozen for now while the case continues in lower courts.</p>
            <p>Three liberal judges disagreed today. They believe this decision challenges the idea of separate powers in the U.S. government (executive, legislative, and judicial). They also pointed out that the Constitution "gives Congress the power to decide how money is spent by making appropriation laws."</p>

            <h1>Singer Usay Kawlu in India Remembers Hualien Victims, Asks for Strong Spirit</h1>
            <p>A landslide dam lake at Mata'an Creek in Hualien overflowed and caused damage. While the Golden Melody Award-winning singer Usay Kawlu was performing in India, she was thinking about the people affected by the disaster in Hualien. She hopes that everyone can be strong, like the "tree bean" that the name Mata'an means.</p>
            <p>This year marks 30 years since Taiwan and India started having offices in each other's countries. With support from Taiwan's Ministry of Culture and its office in India, "2025 Taiwan Indigenous Music Night" took place on the evening of September 26th at The Piano Man Jazz Club in New Delhi. Usay Kawlu, a Golden Melody Award winner, and well-known musician Musa gave a wonderful musical show to the audience.</p>
            <p>Usay Kawlu, who is from Hualien, said that Hualien is where she grew up. Her music also comes from Hualien. Even though she moved to other places when she got older, she feels like she gets new energy every time she goes back to Hualien.</p>
            <p>Hualien has been hit by typhoons and heavy rain many times. On September 23rd, the Mata'an Creek landslide dam lake overflowed again, causing serious problems in the area. Usay Kawlu, who is currently in India, is worried about her family, friends, and all the people affected in Hualien.</p>
            <p>When a reporter asked her about it, Usay Kawlu said that she was filming a TV show when the news came out. She heard it was very serious. "The videos I saw showed water that seemed to be one story high," so she quickly called her family.</p>
            <p>Usay Kawlu said that some of her family members could not move easily, so they had to be carried to the second floor. "So, I was very emotional at that moment, and my hands kept shaking," she said. Many of her family live in areas that were badly hit, so she quickly contacted everyone. Luckily, everyone was safe.</p>
            <p>Usay Kawlu said that many homes will need to be fixed, and this will need help from everyone. People are already in Hualien helping with the rescue work. She is very thankful and wants to go back to Hualien to see what happened after her performance.</p>
            <p>For the people in the disaster area, Usay Kawlu wants to encourage them using the name "Mata'an."</p>
            <p>Usay Kawlu told the reporter that Mata'an is an Amis word that means "tree bean." Tree beans can grow very well and are also very strong. "So I hope everyone can be as strong as Mata'an. Let's all work together," she said.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Kagasa caused serious damage in Hualien. As of 7 AM on September 26th, the Mata'an Creek landslide dam lake overflow had caused 14 deaths and 11 people were still missing.</p>
