            <h1>Controlling Drugs Similar to Etomidate: Some Say There's No Proof of Addiction</h1>
            <p>Etomidate e-cigarettes, also called 'zombie vape cartridges,' are a new kind of drug that people often use wrongly. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has finished the time for public comments on adding three substances similar to etomidate to its list of controlled drugs. Those who disagree say there is no scientific proof that these substances cause addiction. They also say that other countries do not control these substances and that Taiwan is making laws that are too strict.</p>
            <p>In Taiwan, etomidate was first only seen as a controlled medicine. Last November, it was changed to a Class 2 illegal drug. On July 4 this year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it would change the 'Controlled Drugs Classification and Items' list. They added three new substances that are similar to etomidate, such as Butomidate, Dintomide, Trifluoroetomidate, and Fluoroetomidate. All of these will be Class 2 controlled medicines.</p>
            <p>The new law was open for public comments for 14 days, until July 18. Some people disagreed, saying there is no scientific proof that these substances cause addiction. They argue that this goes against what the law needs. By law, a substance must be addictive and often abused to be controlled. But right now, no studies on animals or humans show these substances are addictive. The government only says they are similar in structure to etomidate, which means they might have similar effects. This breaks the rules of fairness and legal certainty.</p>
            <p>Those who disagree also said that these substances are not controlled under the three main United Nations drug agreements. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has only found these substances in samples from East Asia. It has not said there is a risk of global misuse. If Taiwan is the first to classify them as serious illegal drugs, it will be different from international rules. This could affect how countries help each other with crime and how much people trust the law.</p>
            <p>Opponents suggest that Dintomide, Trifluoroetomidate, and Fluoroetomidate should first be put on a watch list. They believe that drug studies and risk checks should start. These substances should be watched, not immediately controlled. Chang Chih-hsu, the deputy head of the FDA's Controlled Drugs Division, told CNA today that they received only one comment during this public review period. They will give a full response on the public policy online platform when the new rules are officially announced.</p>
            <p>Regarding when the new rules will start, Chang Chih-hsu said that they will gather all comments and send them to the Executive Yuan for approval and announcement. The official start date will follow the Executive Yuan's announcement.</p>
            <p>Chang Chih-hsu pointed out that if someone brings in, sends out, makes, sells, or buys controlled drugs without a special license, they break the rules for managing controlled drugs. They can be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000. If someone has a license but does not keep clear records of how much controlled medicine they get, use, destroy, lose, and have left each day, they can also be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000.</p>
            <p>Chang Chih-hsu said that if someone with a controlled drug license does not report their use regularly, they also break the rules. They can be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000. If someone uses controlled drugs for medical research or teaching without permission from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, they could be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000.</p>

            <h1>Father in South Korea Kills Son with Homemade Gun, Had Bombs at Home</h1>
            <p>In South Korea, a 63-year-old man named Mr. A is believed to have shot and killed his son with a homemade gun. This happened on the evening of July 20th, during Mr. A's birthday party. He ran away but was caught by the police later. During the investigation, police found many homemade bombs hidden in his home. These bombs were set to explode at noon today.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency reported that Mr. A is suspected of killing his 30-year-old son, Mr. B, with a homemade gun. This happened around 9:31 PM on July 20th, at their home on the 33rd floor of an apartment building in Incheon. At the time, Mr. A was at his birthday party, which his son had planned for him. His daughter-in-law, two grandchildren, and friends were also there.</p>
            <p>After Mr. A committed the crime, the other people at the party hid in a room and called the police. The police did not go into the apartment right away because they were not sure if Mr. A was still inside. They wanted to prevent more people from getting hurt. After they confirmed Mr. A had left, they went in and took Mr. B to the hospital. At that time, his heart had stopped beating, and he later died.</p>
            <p>The police arrested Mr. A in Seoul at 12:20 AM today. During questioning, he said he did it because of problems in his family. He learned how to make guns from YouTube. The bullets he used were hunting bullets that he bought about 20 years ago and kept in a storage room. The investigation showed that Mr. A used three bullets that day. One hit a door, and two hit his son's chest. He still had 86 bullets left.</p>
            <p>Based on what Mr. A told them, the police found 15 bombs made from plastic bottles and milk cartons at his home in Dobong District, Seoul. These bombs had devices to make them explode, and they were set to go off at 12:00 PM today. In his car, police found two homemade guns and nine gun barrels. They also found five to six metal tubes in his house that could be used to make guns.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Teachers Ask People to Come Home and Vote to Remove a Politician; KMT Says Teachers Are Being Used</h1>
            <p>Today, a group of female teachers, both retired and still working, in Hualien asked people from Hualien who live outside the county to come back home and vote in the recall election. They said, 'Fu Kun-chi was chosen by Hualien people, so Hualien people have a duty to remove him.' The KMT party group in the Hualien County Council said this was 'using children as hostages and turning teachers into tools for fighting.'</p>
            <p>Independent Hualien County Councilor Yang Hua-mei and former legislator Dr. Chen Yung-hsing held a press conference today with nine retired and current teachers. These teachers believe that education is not only about teaching facts, but also about building principles of honesty and following laws. As teachers, they felt they should speak up. They asked people from Hualien who live outside, including students and workers, to come home and vote. They want them to use their votes to protect their belief in honesty and lawfulness, so Hualien people can get back their respect and honor.</p>
            <p>A retired female elementary school teacher, Ms. Dai, said that Hualien has become less bright over the past 23 years. However, the fancy house of KMT legislator Fu Kun-chi is very grand. This has created a real situation of 'poor Hualien, rich Fu Kun-chi.' Since Fu Kun-chi was elected by Hualien people, Hualien people have a duty to remove him. History will show that 'brave Hualien people ended the Fu family's rule in 2025.'</p>
            <p>A retired female teacher, Ms. Hong, said she never talked about politics in class. But changes over the past year have made her decide to speak up. She called on people from Hualien living elsewhere to vote bravely. She said, 'Let's restart Hualien, protect Taiwan, and let our children grow up safely in a land of freedom and fairness.'</p>
            <p>A current teacher, who did not want to be named, said that this is not a fight between political parties. Instead, it is a choice between caring for Hualien and giving up on Hualien. They asked people from Hualien living elsewhere to come back and vote on July 26.</p>
            <p>The KMT party group in the Hualien County Council replied through a press release. They said that education should not be used as a tool for fighting. Using children as hostages and making teachers into tools for fighting is 'the deepest betrayal of Hualien.'</p>
            <p>The KMT group said that at a time when Taiwan society faces extreme political actions and breaking down of values, they saw a very sad press conference. Yang Hua-mei and Chen Yung-hsing pushed teachers to the front lines of a political storm. A recall effort was covered with the idea of 'mother's love' and 'educational conscience,' but it became a political show to control people's minds.</p>
            <p>The KMT group said, 'Such a press conference is not progress for democracy, but a fall in politics.' They believe that education should give children the power to think for themselves, not plant seeds of hate and conflict.</p>
