            <h1>US-Russia Summit to Happen; Trump Says He Won't Be Scared by Putin</h1>
            <p>The important meeting between the US and Russia will happen tomorrow. US President Trump said today that he will not be scared by Russian President Putin. He also said that Ukraine will be part of any agreement about its future.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Putin will fly to Alaska, USA, tomorrow because Trump invited him. This is the first time Putin visits a Western country since 2022, when he ordered a full attack on Ukraine, which caused many deaths.</p>
            <p>Russia has been successful in the war. The Kremlin said that the two presidents plan to have a meeting just by themselves. This makes European leaders more worried that Putin might trick Trump into agreeing to terms that are forced on Kyiv.</p>
            <p>Trump told the media at the White House, "I am the president. He will not mess with me."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "In the first 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes, I will know if the meeting will go well or badly."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "If it is a bad meeting, it will end quickly. If it goes well, we will make peace soon." Trump thinks there is a 25% chance the US-Russia meeting will fail.</p>
            <p>Trump has said before that he admires Putin. At a meeting in Helsinki in 2018, he seemed to agree with Putin who said Russia did not interfere in the US election. Because of this, Trump received a lot of criticism after the meeting.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy was not invited to the Alaska meeting. He said the meeting was a reward for Putin. He also refused Trump's request to give up land.</p>
            <p>Trump promised not to make any deals with Putin alone. He said he wants to have a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy, maybe right after the Alaska meeting.</p>
            <p>Trump told Fox News Radio, "The second meeting will be very, very important because that is when they will make a deal. I don't want to use the word 'divide.' But, you know, in some ways, it's not a bad word."</p>
            <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the media that any future agreement must make sure Ukraine's "safety is guaranteed."</p>

            <h1>Legislator Liu Shu-bin Asks About Energy During Fraud Report; Han Kuo-yu Says It Does Not Fit the Topic</h1>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan invited Premier Cho Jung-tai to give a report on fighting fraud. But during her questions, Legislator Liu Shu-bin from the Taiwan People's Party started talking about energy. The President of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu, stopped her and said her questions "did not match the topic." He said that in the past, the Legislative Yuan might have allowed wrong practices to become common. He asked Liu Shu-bin to go back to the topic of fighting fraud.</p>
            <p>Even though Han Kuo-yu told her directly, Liu Shu-bin kept talking about energy. She said that the government's wrong energy policies were like a scam. Premier Cho Jung-tai said that Liu Shu-bin's questions not only went against Han Kuo-yu's instructions but also made no sense. He could not understand her.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party had suggested inviting Premier Cho Jung-tai to the Legislative Yuan to report on the results of "Fraud Fighting Strategy Action Plan 2.0." Both ruling and opposition parties agreed to arrange the report for August 15th. Today, the Legislative Yuan invited Cho Jung-tai to give this report and answer questions.</p>
            <p>At the start of her questions today, Liu Shu-bin said the government's fraud-fighting efforts have not worked well for a long time. But soon after, she started talking about renewable energy and nuclear-free issues. She said that typhoons in central and southern Taiwan caused solar panels to pile up, and they have not been cleaned up yet. She also said the government keeps saying good things about renewable energy and that its cost will go down. But in reality, she said, these systems could not handle the typhoons, and many testing devices lost money before they even produced power.</p>
            <p>Cho Jung-tai replied that the phrase "could not handle the typhoons" might need to be changed. Liu Shu-bin stopped talking for a moment but then quickly said, "No need." She meant places used for generating electricity. After that, she started talking about the cost of making electricity, giving NT$100 billion to Taipower, and electricity prices.</p>
            <p>During the questioning, Han Kuo-yu suddenly stopped her and said the time for questions was paused. He directly told Liu Shu-bin that today's meeting was to hear the Premier and his team report on fraud-fighting plans, as required by law. If Liu Shu-bin wanted to ask about energy, the Legislative Yuan should agree first and then invite Cho Jung-tai to report on energy. He said that asking about energy when the topic was fraud was "not matching the name."</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that in the past, wrong practices might have become normal in the Legislative Yuan. So, he specially reminded Liu Shu-bin that he hoped her questions would return to the fraud-fighting strategy. After hearing this, Cho Jung-tai immediately said, "Thank you, President Han, for your instruction."</p>
            <p>However, Liu Shu-bin replied right away that she respected Han Kuo-yu's instruction, but she would quickly finish this topic. After that, Liu Shu-bin kept asking about renewable energy. She also said that TSMC building factories overseas was related to energy. She even asked Lin Chang-tso, Taiwan's representative in Finland, to learn about nuclear energy there.</p>
            <p>Liu Shu-bin also mentioned that Taiwan's three biggest public complaints right now are about equal tariffs, energy policy, and fraud. People do not trust the government enough, and the ruling party has made things look better than they are for a long time. She said that the DPP government lied for votes, which led to wrong energy policies, financial losses for the government, and even companies moving out of Taiwan. Because of this, people think the government is a scam.</p>
            <p>In response, Cho Jung-tai said that Liu Shu-bin's questions not only went against Han Kuo-yu's instructions but also made no sense. He could not understand her. When he finished speaking, the questioning time ended. Liu Shu-bin seemed a bit helpless. Han Kuo-yu then said, "You worked hard, Legislator Liu Shu-bin."</p>

            <h1>Man in Taichung Rides Motorcycle the Wrong Way Without a Helmet; Police Stop Him and Find Drugs</h1>
            <p>In Taichung City, a man in his 50s, named Li, was riding his motorcycle without a helmet and going the wrong way. He saw police officers on patrol and felt guilty. So, he threw away the drugs he had along the road. When the police stopped him, the man tried to turn and escape. The police found e-cigarettes and drugs, and they sent him to the prosecutor's office as required by law.</p>
            <p>The Dajia Police Station in Taichung City said today in a written statement that their officers were on patrol. When they were at the intersection of Jingguo Road and Jinhua Street in Dajia District, they saw a man without a helmet. He was riding his motorcycle the wrong way the whole time. When he turned out of the intersection, he happened to see the police officers on patrol.</p>
            <p>The police used their car to block and signal the man to stop. The man did not want to stop easily. He tried to ride his motorcycle to turn and run away. He also threw away etomidate e-cigarettes along the road to avoid being caught by the police. The police later found one etomidate e-cigarette, two bottles of etomidate e-liquid, and two bags of marijuana drugs on the man. Initial tests showed positive results for drugs.</p>
            <p>The police checked further, and Mr. Li admitted that the drugs were for his own use. He used drugs at home. After using drugs, he felt confused and unwell, so he rode his motorcycle without a helmet, which made the police notice him. After questioning, the man was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, suspected of breaking the Narcotics Hazard Prevention Act and public safety laws.</p>
