            <h1>China Airlines Works with Top US Airline to Offer Single Ticket Service Across America</h1>
            <p>China Airlines announced today that it is partnering with Southwest Airlines, the largest domestic airline in the United States. China Airlines General Manager Chen Han-ming said that in the future, travelers can enjoy a "single ticket" service. This means that if they buy a ticket through China Airlines, they can connect to Southwest Airlines flights to many places all over the US.</p>
            <p>China Airlines and Southwest Airlines held a joint press conference today in Long Beach, California. Steven Swan, Director of Route Planning and Strategic Alliances at Southwest Airlines, attended the launch event. He stressed that "China Airlines is Southwest Airlines' first partner in Asia."</p>
            <p>Southwest Airlines is the 4th largest airline in the US. It also carries the most passengers on domestic flights, operating over 4,000 flights every day.</p>
            <p>At the end of July, China Airlines announced a new direct flight to Phoenix. Added to its current direct flight cities, which include Los Angeles, San Francisco, Ontario in California, Seattle, Vancouver, and New York, travelers will now be able to connect to Southwest Airlines flights to many more places across the US.</p>
            <p>Chen Han-ming said that China Airlines is growing its business in the US. They hope to bring more travelers to Taiwan, for connecting flights or for tourism. This will help the tourism industry in Taiwan grow. They hope Taiwan will become an important transfer hub in Asia.</p>
            <p>Steven Swan, a senior leader at Southwest Airlines, went to Taiwan in early March to discuss this partnership plan. He said that besides linking the two airlines' networks, they are also talking about whether they can accept each other's frequent flyer miles. If they agree, travelers' accumulated miles could be used for both China Airlines and Southwest Airlines.</p>
            <p>Swan has worked in the airline industry for over 23 years and has been a manager at several companies. He has visited Taiwan for business more than 10 times. He said that by working with China Airlines, Southwest Airlines can not only improve its ability to compete in the US market but also learn from China Airlines and share experiences.</p>
            <p>It is a new trend for Taiwanese airlines to work with North American airlines. Starlux Airlines also started a partnership with American Airlines on August 15th. Chen Han-ming said that Southwest Airlines' large network in North America is a big advantage. This partnership will help travelers connect to different parts of the US more easily and efficiently, making travel more convenient.</p>

            <h1>Japan's Honjo High School Visits Tainan First Senior High School: Two Schools Learn Together Across Countries</h1>
            <p>Teachers and students from Honjo High School, which is connected to Waseda University in Japan, recently visited National Tainan First Senior High School. Students from both schools also went to the Zengwun River to do a field study on the river's plants and animals. They observed the river's ecosystem firsthand, learning together across countries.</p>
            <p>Tainan First Senior High School released a news report today. It stated that Principal Handa Toru from Honjo High School led 12 students to visit Tainan First Senior High School on August 14th. They had two days of in-depth exchange activities, which included science research, cultural experiences, and local visits.</p>
            <p>The Honjo High School river study team does volunteer river studies in Honjo City, Japan, every year, and they publish their findings in books. This time, they came to Taiwan not only with their latest published book but also went with the science class from Tainan First Senior High School to the Zengwun River for a field study of its ecosystem. Students from both schools were divided into mixed groups. They wore waterproof clothes and carried nets to go into the water and observe the river's ecosystem directly.</p>
            <p>For sharing research findings, the science class from Tainan First Senior High School presented their two science fair projects completely in English. They shared their research process, which was a real example of academic discussion between countries. They learned to look at their research with a global view and to broaden their thinking from different cultures. This helps them prepare for future international study and work.</p>
            <p>In addition, the teachers and students from Honjo High School also visited the Yujing Mango Wholesale Market. There, they learned about Tainan's farming industry and local culture. They also visited Japanese-era buildings and temples in Tainan City, which made their exchange broader.</p>
            <p>During the exchange, twin sisters from Honjo High School wore kimonos and showed how to perform a Japanese tea ceremony. They also gave a complete tea ceremony set to Tainan First Senior High School. This allowed the Taiwanese students to deeply experience traditional Japanese culture, improving friendship and cultural understanding between the two sides.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung's "High-Speed Youth Music Show": Fire EX. Works with New Bands to Create New Songs</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Youth Bureau's "2025 High-Speed Youth Music Show" will take place on August 23rd at LIVE WAREHOUSE in Pier-2 Art Center's Dayi Warehouse. During the event, two trained bands will release new songs they created with members of the band Fire EX. This will show the original creative power of young people.</p>
            <p>Lin Kai-hsuan, Director of the Youth Bureau, said that "High-Speed Youth" is now in its 5th year. This is an important program the city government has used recently to help people develop skills in the music industry. The program includes "training courses" and "work experiences." These help young people understand the many different jobs in the music industry, both in front of and behind the stage. Through the music show, more people can see new bands, making Kaohsiung a place where Taiwan's next big bands can start.</p>
            <p>The Youth Bureau said in a news report today that this year's event focuses on two new bands, "BUTTER RIOT" and "YUMMY MAN." These two bands will release new songs for the first time, which they created with members of the band Fire EX. The event also invited three popular bands, "P!SCO," "Children King," and "EmptyORio," to join. This will be the last big music event of the summer in Southern Taiwan. The event is free to enter, and music fans are welcome to come.</p>
            <p>The Youth Bureau said that this year's two trained bands were chosen together by "High-Speed Youth" and "StreetVoice" teachers. Most of the band members are from Kaohsiung and often play in small and medium music venues in the city. "YUMMY MAN" plays Taiwanese rock music that shows excitement and humor, and their singing is full of strong feelings. "BUTTER RIOT," which is greatly influenced by punk music, sings about young people's confusion and hopes about life today.</p>
            <p>Also, besides the first appearance of the trained bands, the event also invited "P!SCO" from Taipei. They have a stage presence that looks and sounds good, and they are called "the dance-rock band that makes you move the most." "Children King," a local Kaohsiung band, sings in fluent Taiwanese about small details of life. Their music style is honest and deep. The last band, "EmptyORio," plays energetic punk music that directly faces reality. Under a wild appearance, strong and subtle feelings are mixed in their music.</p>
            <p>The Youth Bureau pointed out that this year's show mixes different music styles like rock, punk, and pop. They will sing youth stories with unique melodies and lyrics. Music fans are invited to come and join this Saturday at 2:30 PM, and show their support for young people's music creations.</p>
