            <h1>Australia to Spend 12 Billion Australian Dollars on Defense Buildings for AUKUS Submarines</h1>
            <p>Today, Australia announced that it will spend 12 billion Australian dollars, which is 8 billion US dollars, to build new defense buildings in Western Australia. These buildings will help with the AUKUS agreement to give nuclear submarines to Australia.</p>
            <p>Australia, the UK, and the USA made the AUKUS agreement in 2021. Its goal is to provide nuclear-powered attack submarines to Australia starting in the next ten years. This is to deal with China's plans in the Indo-Pacific area. The government of US President Trump is now reviewing this agreement again.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Australia's Defense Minister, Richard Marles, said that the planned defense area is very important for Australia's shipbuilding and repair businesses. It will help Western Australia keep building warships and support Australia's nuclear submarine program.</p>
            <p>Last year, the Australian government first spent 127 million Australian dollars (84 million US dollars) to improve the Henderson shipyard, which is near Perth. They also said they will spend billions of Australian dollars over the next 20 years. This money will turn the shipyard into a repair center for the AUKUS submarine fleet.</p>
            <p>The AUKUS agreement is worth hundreds of billions of US dollars. Under this agreement, the United States will sell several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. Also, the UK and Australia will work together later to build new AUKUS-class submarines.</p>

            <h1>Over 100,000 People Attend Far-Right Protest in London, Clashes Occur, 9 Arrested</h1>
            <p>Today, in London, the capital of the UK, a large protest organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson led to fights. More than 100,000 people came. Police tried to control the crowd but faced "unacceptable violence." They arrested 9 people.</p>
            <p>News agencies AFP and Reuters reported that Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, says he is a journalist who exposes wrongdoings by the state. He called this "Unite the Kingdom" march and gathering the nation's "biggest free speech festival."</p>
            <p>About 1.5 kilometers north of this protest, around 5,000 people took part in a "Stand Up to Racism" march. The Metropolitan Police in London sent about 1,000 police officers to keep the two opposing groups apart.</p>
            <p>London police said that the "Unite the Kingdom" protest became violent because some people could not get to the main stage. So, they tried to enter a "safe area" that was not far from the other group.</p>
            <p>Police said: "When officers went to stop them, they faced unacceptable violence. People punched and kicked them, and others threw bottles, flares, and other things at them."</p>
            <p>Police said they have arrested 9 people so far and added that more arrests might happen.</p>
            <p>The UK is receiving a record number of requests for protection. Because of this, the topic of immigration has become the most important political issue, more important than worries about the economy slowing down. So far this year, over 28,000 immigrants have come into the UK by crossing the English Channel in small boats.</p>

            <h1>Drone Enters Romanian Airspace, Fighter Jets Respond Quickly</h1>
            <p>Romania's Ministry of Defense announced that a drone entered Romanian airspace today. This happened while Russia was attacking important buildings in Ukraine. Romanian fighter jets quickly flew up to respond.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Poland also faced a threat from a drone attack. The government in Warsaw sent its own military planes and planes from its allies. They also closed the airport in the eastern city of Lublin. Three days before this, Poland and its NATO allies had worked together to shoot down a Russian drone in their airspace.</p>
            <p>Romania is a member of the European Union and NATO. It shares a land border with Ukraine that is about 650 kilometers long. Since Russia started its full invasion of Ukraine in 2022, pieces of Russian drones have been found inside Romania many times.</p>
            <p>According to a statement from the Ministry of Defense, Romania quickly sent two F-16 fighter jets today. They also sent a warning to people living in Tulcea, a southeastern area close to the border, telling them to find shelter.</p>
            <p>The statement said that the fighter jets found one drone that had entered the country's airspace. They followed it until it disappeared from their radar.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Defense added, "The drone did not fly over areas where people live, so there was no immediate danger to the public."</p>
