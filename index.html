New reports suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) is not just replacing jobs, but also creating many new ones. However, these new roles are often different from what people expect. Many of the new jobs are focused on managing and improving AI systems, or helping people use AI tools effectively.

For example, there's a growing need for "AI trainers" who teach AI models how to perform tasks, and "AI ethicists" who make sure AI is used fairly and responsibly. Companies are also looking for "prompt engineers," who write specific instructions for AI to get the best results. These jobs require a mix of technical skills and understanding of human language and behavior.

This trend means that workers might need to learn new skills to stay relevant in the changing job market. Instead of just focusing on coding, skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication are becoming more important when working with AI. Experts believe that AI will change how we work, leading to new opportunities for those who adapt.

**'Coffee Badging' Becomes a New Workplace Trend**

A new trend called 'coffee badging' is becoming common among people who work in hybrid offices. This means employees come to the office only for a short time, maybe just for a meeting or to grab a coffee, before leaving again. They "badge in" (scan their ID to enter) but don't stay for the whole workday.

This trend is often seen with workers who live far from the office or prefer to do most of their work at home. They might visit the office to show their face, connect with colleagues briefly, or attend specific team gatherings. After these interactions, they return home to complete their tasks remotely.

Experts say 'coffee badging' shows how hybrid work is still developing. Companies are trying to find the right balance between remote and office work. Some see it as a way for employees to stay connected, while others worry it might reduce teamwork and make it harder to build strong company culture.

**Europe's Popular Tourist Areas Face Extreme Heat**

Many of Europe's most famous tourist destinations are getting too hot, especially during summer. This change is due to climate change, which is causing more frequent and intense heatwaves. Places like Athens, Rome, and parts of Spain are experiencing temperatures that make sightseeing very uncomfortable or even dangerous for visitors.

Tourists are now rethinking their travel plans. Some are choosing to visit these places during cooler months, like spring or autumn, instead of the traditional summer holidays. Others are looking for cooler destinations altogether, perhaps in Northern Europe or mountain areas. This shift is affecting local businesses that depend on summer tourism.

Local authorities and tour operators are trying to adapt. Some are offering more evening activities when temperatures drop, or providing better shade and water access at attractions. There's also a growing discussion about how to manage tourism sustainably as global temperatures continue to rise.`;
