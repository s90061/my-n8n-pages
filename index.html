            <h1>UK Think Tank Report: Chinese Students Asked to Watch Classmates</h1>
            <p>A new report from a British research group says that Chinese students in UK universities are asked to watch their classmates. This is done to stop talks about topics that China considers sensitive. Also, some UK universities do not want to deal with China's interference because they depend too much on fees from Chinese students.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported on August 4th that the British research group "UK-China Transparency" released this new report. It states that Chinese students in the UK feel pressure to watch their classmates for their own government.</p>
            <p>Also, their study of experts in Chinese studies showed that Chinese officials have told teachers not to talk about certain topics in class.</p>
            <p>The report also said that some experts shared how their families in China were troubled or threatened because of the work they do in the UK.</p>
            <p>These sensitive topics include things from technology and science to politics and culture. For example, they include claims of genocide in China's Xinjiang area, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the growth of Chinese technology companies.</p>
            <p>Some experts said that visiting scholars, other Chinese officials, and staff from Confucius Institutes have scared them. Confucius Institutes are set up by schools in the UK and China, along with Chinese government groups. They aim to teach Chinese language and culture. But they have been criticized for having ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
            <p>The "UK-China Transparency" report says that some universities do not want to face the issue of China's interference. This is because they rely too much on the money from Chinese students' tuition fees.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in London called this report "untrue and silly." They also said that China respects freedom of speech in the UK and other places.</p>
            <p>The report came out when a new law in the UK started. This law asks universities to work harder to support freedom of thought and speech. This is true even if they have agreements with other countries. If universities do not follow these rules, they could be fined millions of British pounds.</p>

            <h1>China A-Share New Accounts Increased by 70.5% in July</h1>
            <p>New information from the Shanghai Stock Exchange shows that in July, 1.96 million new A-share accounts were opened. This is a 70.5% increase compared to the same time last year. From January to July this year, a total of 14.56 million new A-share accounts were opened, which is a 36.88% increase from last year.</p>
            <p>The Shanghai Stock Exchange's newest data shows that 1.96 million new A-share accounts were opened in July. This is 70.5% more than last year and 19.27% more than the month before. Among these new accounts in July, 1.95 million were for individuals and 9,600 were for companies. By the end of July this year, the total number of new A-share accounts reached 14.56 million, a 36.88% rise from last year.</p>
            <p>Pengpai News reported on August 5th that experts believe the increase in new A-share accounts in July is because the A-share market did well that month. In July, all A-share indexes went up. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 3.74%, the Shenzhen Component Index by 5.20%, and the ChiNext Index by 8.14%.</p>
            <p>Morgan Stanley Fund stated that they are positive about the growth of technology, especially AI applications and semiconductors, as they offer better value. They also like "Made in China" products, such as high-end machinery, cars, military items, and even medicine. Good companies in these areas are important. They also expect new ways of spending money to help listed companies earn more.</p>
            <p>"21st Century Business Herald" reported on August 5th that changes in the number of new A-share accounts are a key sign to watch. This is in addition to how fast borrowing money increases and how much foreign money flows in. Market analysis this year shows that the average daily trading amount in the A-share market is directly related to the number of new accounts opened at the same time.</p>
            <p>The report said that as the amount of money traded in the stock market keeps going up, the number of new accounts also continues to grow. This year, the stock market has not changed as much as last year, but more new accounts have been opened compared to last year. This shows that the market is giving people a chance to earn money, bringing more and more investors to join.</p>
            <p>Securities Times reported on August 5th that a big increase in new accounts means more money is coming into the market. More investors are actively putting money into A-shares. They expect the market to do well in the long term. This shows that the A-share market is getting better because of money coming in and good feelings from investors.</p>

            <h1>Chen Cheng-hung Wins Rural Navigator Award for Protecting Jincheng Wu Tree Landscape</h1>
            <p>Chen Cheng-hung, who leads the Wanan Community Development Association in Chishang Township, Taitung County, has worked hard in his village. He stopped electricity poles from being put in farming areas like Brown Avenue and the Jincheng Wu Tree. Because of this, he won the Rural Navigator Award from the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture's Rural Development and Soil and Water Conservation Agency held the 4th Rural Navigator Awards. Thirty-one people who do great work in rural areas were chosen first. In the end, 10 people received the "Rural Navigator Award" and 10 became "Rural Promotion Ambassadors." Chen Cheng-hung was one of the winners of the Rural Navigator Award.</p>
            <p>Rao Ching-ling said today in a press release that Taitung's "slow economy" and the idea of "three lives (production, ecology, and living) growing together" need more people like Chen Cheng-hung. These people take action to meet the needs of their land and community. This award for Chen Cheng-hung also shows the Wanan community's ability to improve itself and what it can do in the future.</p>
            <p>She said that since Chen Cheng-hung became the leader, he has actively worked on community management and green care. He has focused on teaching in the countryside, helping older people, and building the community. He has brought together Chishang's farm culture and local features. He has led the Wanan community to become a friendly rural area that teaches and lets people take part. Last year, he also led the Wanan community to win a gold award in the "3rd Golden Rural Competition."</p>
            <p>The Taitung County Government's Department of Agriculture said that 20 years ago, Chen Cheng-hung led the people of Wanan community to stop electricity poles from entering their farmland. This helped keep the old farm area of Chishang with its special culture. It also created the place for the Brown Avenue Autumn Harvest Art Festival every year and made the Jincheng Wu Tree (Evergreen Teatree) a famous tourist spot.</p>
            <p>The Department of Agriculture added that Chen Cheng-hung hopes his hometown will have "three lives growing together" and lasting development in 30 years. He continues to work for the whole community's growth. For the rice industry, he helps small farmers and young farmers with processing and packaging. This reduces the pressure of buying expensive equipment and makes the quality of processed goods better. So far, 12 "National Rice Kings" have worked with him. Chen Cheng-hung also led the Wanan community to join the small farmer carbon farming project. They have signed agreements for 200 hectares of farmland, which increases farmers' income and aims for the land to be useful for a long time.</p>
