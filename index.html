            <h1>UN General Assembly to Open: Official in Chicago Says Taiwan's Participation is Very Important to the US</h1>
            <p>The United Nations General Assembly will start next week in New York. A newspaper in Illinois, USA, called "Daily Herald," published an article by an official from Taiwan's office in Chicago. The article asked the US to support Taiwan joining UN meetings and systems. It also asked the US to stop Communist China from wrongly using UN Resolution 2758.</p>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly will begin on September 9th in New York. On September 1st, the "Daily Herald" in Illinois published an article. The article was written by Lai Yen-feng, who is the head of Taiwan's office in Chicago. The article's title was "Taiwan's Participation in the UN is Very Important to the US."</p>
            <p>Lai Yen-feng wrote that the international system, which is based on rules, needs to be clear, fair, and open to everyone working together. However, China is increasingly using the UN's systems for its own political goals. It is very important for the US to fight against these actions.</p>
            <p>If Taiwan joins the UN, it will help to stop Communist China from controlling these systems. Taiwan is also a good partner for the US in protecting democratic rules and global peace.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is good at democratic rule, making things better for the future, and new technology. These strengths match many of the important goals of the UN. Letting Taiwan join the UN will make international cooperation stronger. It will also stop Beijing from trying to control what everyone says in the world.</p>
            <p>The article explained that Beijing keeps twisting UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. It uses false reasons to stop Taiwan from joining UN systems. This resolution does not give China any power over Taiwan.</p>
            <p>If Taiwan continues to be kept out, it will make the UN less trusted. It is a bad sign if expert groups become too political. The UN was created to help people around the world, not to stop them.</p>
            <p>People with Taiwan passports are not allowed into UN buildings. Taiwanese reporters are also not allowed to cover UN events. This goes against basic human rights, like the freedom of the press. Strong governments that do not allow freedom are growing around the world. So, it is very important to let Taiwan be part of UN discussions. This helps keep talks open, information clear, and international laws respected.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's involvement in the UN will help the UN focus on important global issues. It will not have to give in to political pressure.</p>
            <p>Letting Taiwan join UN systems is not just about Taiwan. It also matters for how right and effective the UN is. We hope the US will lead the way to make sure Taiwan can take part in UN meetings and systems. This will protect future international cooperation from unfair political influence.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Rumors of His Death are "Fake News": "I Was Very Active All Weekend"</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump did not appear in public for several days last week, which was unusual. Because of this, rumors spread online that Trump had died. Today, he responded to these rumors. He said he heard about them and called them "fake news." He also said that he was "very active all weekend."</p>
            <p>Trump, who is 79 years old, often has public events since he came back to the White House. But last week, he did not show up in front of the media for a few days. This led to the rumors online that he had passed away. However, during the weekend, the media saw Trump at a golf course.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Trump announced in the White House's Oval Office that the US Space Command headquarters will move from Colorado to Alabama. He also answered questions from the media. The press conference lasted about 48 minutes, and Trump looked fine.</p>
            <p>The media asked about the widespread rumors on social media that Trump had died. He answered that he didn't see the rumors himself, but he heard about them. He said it was "a bit crazy" and called it "fake news."</p>
            <p>Trump explained that he held several press conferences last week. Then, he didn't hold any for two days. That's when people started saying, "Something must have happened to him."</p>
            <p>He said he appeared on many TV shows. He also posted a lot on his own social media platform, "Truth Social." He also visited some people. Last weekend was a holiday in the US called Labor Day. He said, "I was very active all weekend."</p>
