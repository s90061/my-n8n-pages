            <h1>Fishing Boat on Fire in Keelung Badouzi, 6 Crew Members Jump into Sea to Escape</h1>
            <p>Tonight, a 56-ton fishing boat from Shenao, New Taipei, named "Jin De Cai," caught fire at Badouzi Fishing Port in Keelung. The fire was strong, and black smoke went high into the sky. The fire was controlled around 10 PM. The six crew members on the boat saw the fire and jumped into the sea to escape. Luckily, no one was hurt. The cause of the fire is still being investigated.</p>
            <p>The Keelung City Fire Department received a report at 9:32 PM that a fishing boat was on fire about 200 meters from the shore. They quickly sent 12 different vehicles and 24 firefighters to help. When the firefighters arrived at the parking lot next to the Keelung District Fishermen's Association, they saw the whole fishing boat was on fire, with black smoke going straight up. They immediately started spraying water to put out the fire.</p>
            <p>Firefighters kept spraying water. Around 10 PM, the fire started to get smaller. However, because the boat was on fire, it was hard to tie it with ropes, so it floated away from the shore. This made it difficult for firefighters to put out the fire well. The Coast Guard sent fire boats to help and pulled the fishing boat closer to the shore. Working together, the Coast Guard and firefighters controlled the fire at 10:43 PM. They are now taking care of the last small fires.</p>
            <p>The boat's captain, Mr. Luo, said that after they finished unloading the fish, he was moving the boat to tie it up and park it. He then saw a lot of smoke and fire coming from inside the boat. To stop the fire from spreading to other fishing boats, he quickly moved the boat away from the shore. The six crew members on the boat jumped into the sea to escape. Luckily, no one was injured.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Returns to Asian Cup Top 8, Half-Taiwanese He Dan Honored to Play for Taiwan</h1>
            <p>With the help of He Dan, who scored 18 points, the most on the team, the Taiwan men's basketball team won against Jordan 78 to 64 in today's playoff game. This means they are back in the top 8 of the Asian Cup after 12 years. He Dan, who is half-Taiwanese, said he feels very honored to play for Taiwan in international games.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan men's basketball team, led by captain Chen Ying-chun, went to the Asian Cup with the bad memory of losing to Jordan with a last-minute shot in the previous cup. They promised to return to the top 8. This time, the team also had the "He brothers," He Dan (Adam Hinton) and He Bo (Robert Hinton), who are half-Taiwanese. This made the team much stronger. In their first group game, they beat strong opponent the Philippines and moved to the playoffs as the second-place team.</p>
            <p>However, their opponent in the playoff game was Jordan again. But this time, He Dan scored 18 points, the most in the game. Captain Chen Ying-chun also added 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists, including two important three-point shots in the fourth quarter. Also, "New Taiwanese" Kao Pai-kai scored 9 points, got 12 rebounds, and blocked 7 shots to protect their basket. Finally, they got revenge for their loss three years ago. After 12 years, they are back in the top 8 of the Asian Cup.</p>
            <p>He Dan, who is called "Super Dan," spoke to the media after the game. He said that the key to winning was everyone working together. He also praised Kao Pai-kai as a "rebounding monster" who helped the Taiwan team get many rebounds. He added that Captain Chen Ying-chun made several important three-point shots. "He shot from places like Curry and Lillard would. This was very important for this win," He Dan said.</p>
            <p>When foreign media asked about how he started playing for the Taiwan team, He Dan explained that his mother was one of the biggest reasons. He also said he is truly honored to play for Taiwan, especially playing and fighting alongside his younger brother He Bo on the international stage. "I couldn't ask for more. This moment feels like a dream come true."</p>
            <p>Next, the Taiwan team will play against strong opponent Iran to try and reach the top 4. Head coach Gianluca Tucci said it might be a very intense game. He added that when facing a very confident team, they must stay humble and try to limit the opponent's performance. "We will get ready like we did for the game against the Philippines. I believe the players are also looking forward to and excited for the next game."</p>
