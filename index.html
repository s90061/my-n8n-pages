            <h1>Dalun Optoelectronics Shows Drone Command Systems at Defense Show</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan International Aerospace and Defense Industry Exhibition started today. Dalun Optoelectronics is there for the first time. They are showing their long-term work in broadband communication and AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) for defense. They have complete systems for satellite communication, drone defense, thermal imaging, night vision, and mobile command centers.</p>
            <p>Dalun Optoelectronics said their new low-earth orbit satellite communication system can quickly connect to OneWeb satellites. It works with Wi-Fi and Gigabit Ethernet. You can set it up fast using a special app. This system uses advanced technology that helps save up to 30% of bandwidth.</p>
            <p>Dalun Optoelectronics explained that low-earth orbit satellites are closer to Earth, so they have very little delay. This means they can send messages almost as fast as ground networks. They need high bandwidth and low power, which is good for defense operations or far-off places. This helps make communication stronger for soldiers.</p>
            <p>For drone long-distance communication, Dalun Optoelectronics offers systems for drones that fly long distances and drones that give a first-person view and move quickly. These systems help with long-range patrols, sea search and rescue, and fast tactical responses.</p>
            <p>Dalun Optoelectronics is showing two drones with long-distance communication systems. One is called LARUS. It's made by Valtec, an American company. It can take off and land vertically and also fly like a plane. It can fly 80 kilometers and stay in the air for 2 hours. It can also take off and land on moving ships. It has optical and thermal cameras, which are useful for sea patrols, search and rescue, and delivering supplies.</p>
            <p>The other drone is ASTER SWARM. It can move very fast and gives a first-person view. It can fly up to 140 kilometers per hour and carry up to 3 kilograms. It has passed strong wind tests (up to level 9). This drone can find targets and do tasks by itself using an AI drone control system. It is very fast, can fly for a long time, and can handle strong winds like military drones. This shows its strengths for military tasks.</p>
            <p>Dalun Optoelectronics also has systems to stop other drones, camera and night vision systems, and mobile command centers. These centers have special equipment to control air pressure and can monitor things for 240 hours. They also have low-earth orbit satellite receivers, a power system that uses both wind and solar energy, and smart environmental controls. These features provide a safe and dependable space for medical and command support.</p>

            <h1>New Law Changes Money for Cities, Transportation Ministry Asks Cities to Pay More for Projects</h1>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Transportation said that the budget for public projects was originally NT$220 billion. But after the law about how money is shared was changed, the budget was cut in half. Now, local governments have more money than before, so they should take responsibility. For example, Taipei City got NT$45.2 billion more in taxes. If they use just one-tenth of this, they can keep their metro projects going smoothly.</p>
            <p>There is a disagreement about the law that shares money. Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an continues to ask for more money for metro construction. He also supports Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai. They all want to tell the central government how they feel about the cut in metro construction funds.</p>
            <p>In the evening, Deputy Minister of Transportation Wu Sheng-yuan explained in a video that local governments should have more power over their own matters. He said the central government is never outside the problem. "We are always the strongest support for local areas. For transportation projects, the central government is always involved. We give full support and share the responsibility."</p>
            <p>Wu Sheng-yuan gave an example. For the year 2026, the Ministry of Transportation first asked for NT$220 billion for public projects. This included money for local metro systems. But because the money-sharing law changed, the central government's money was divided differently. The Ministry of Transportation only received NT$110.1 billion, so their budget was cut in half. He said, "We have very little room, but even so, we try our best to be fair to all parts of the country and help where it's most needed. This is a very difficult job."</p>
            <p>Wu Sheng-yuan pointed out that this year, Taipei City got an extra NT$45.2 billion from the changes to the money-sharing law. If they use just one-tenth of this, they will have enough money for their metro projects. Taichung City also got an extra NT$29.5 billion from the same law. If they use just one-seventh of this, they will have enough money to keep their metro projects going without stopping.</p>
            <p>Wu Sheng-yuan stated that local governments actually have the ability to cover the money gap themselves. He believes that local governments must be responsible for how they share and use this money. He thinks that these new funds are meant to give local areas more freedom and power to plan big construction projects.</p>
            <p>Wu Sheng-yuan also sincerely reminded everyone, "Getting the money is not the end; it's the beginning. How will you use it? Where will you use it? Will you focus on the projects that people care about most? These are the questions local governments must answer to their citizens."</p>
            <p>Wu Sheng-yuan stressed that local governments now have much stronger finances than before. The central government will not avoid its responsibility and will continue to offer support with rules and resources. However, local governments must also show that they can manage their money actively and effectively, and plan projects well.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation once again called on local governments. Since they are getting a lot more money from shared taxes, local governments should put the needs of their citizens first. They should make sure they have enough money for metro and railway projects. They need to actively push forward with transportation projects and help their areas grow.</p>

            <p>Sunfun International and its company, Great Research Biotech, held a meeting for investors. The general manager of Great Research Biotech, Lin Tung-ching, announced that the company will divide its stock. One share will become ten shares. This will make it easier to buy and sell shares and let more people invest. It shows the company's strong wish to grow in international markets and make its shares more valuable for owners.</p>
            <p>Today, Chang Chia-ming, the chairman of Sunfun International and Great Research Biotech, held a special meeting for investors.

Chang Chia-ming personally invited people on PTT, a social media site, and more than 600 internet users came. At the meeting, fried chicken and bubble tea were given out.</p>
            <p>Looking to the future, Lin Tung-ching said that after Great Research Biotech sells its shares on the stock market, about 80% of its money will go into running and buying health product businesses in Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. The other 20% of the money will be used for new projects, like the "Great Research Healthy Retirement Village." This plan aims to fully prepare for future care for older people.</p>
            <p>Also, Chang Li, the chief financial officer of Sunfun, said at the investor meeting that Sunfun's newest plan is to keep growing in digital social media and e-commerce.

            <p>Furthermore, Chang Li said that their dating apps, SweetRing for serious relationships and weTouch for younger people, focus on their own groups of users. In 2024, they started Meifangjia International Real Estate and created Meifang.com. This website allows people to list properties for free. It helps people find homes to live in or properties to invest in. Tens of thousands of landlords and real estate agents have joined. They also plan to start international short-term rental services to find new business chances in the travel market.</p>
