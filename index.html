A former rescue training teacher, Ye Tai-xing, was accused of making fake certificates and teaching with them. He earned nearly 3.4 million New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) this way. A court in Taipei has sentenced him to two years in prison, but he will not go to jail if he behaves well for five years. This is called probation.

The court said that Mr. Ye only had a basic rescue worker qualification. But he pretended to be approved by an international rescue group, IRIA. From 2009 to 2019, he used his job to create fake IRIA certificates and teach classes.

Mr. Ye and his wife, Ms. Liu, told people they were important members of IRIA in Taiwan. They convinced fire departments in different cities to pay for their classes. They gave out 2065 fake certificates. They charged between 800 and 6432 NTD for each. The fire department found out and stopped working with them.

The court decided to be lenient because Mr. Ye and Ms. Liu admitted what they did and showed they were sorry. They also gave back the money they got illegally. Neither of them has been in trouble with the law before. Mr. Ye got two years and Ms. Liu got one year and eleven months, both with five years of probation. They also need to pay money to the public and do community service.

**Missile Truck Almost Hits House During Drill, Air Force Says No Damage**

During a military exercise yesterday, an Air Force truck carrying a Patriot missile almost crashed into a house. The Air Force stated today that no one was hurt and there was no damage. The truck was moving at night and found itself too close to a house's rain roof while turning a corner. It stopped immediately. The police came to help, and the truck was able to move away safely.

News reports said that the military truck, which had a Patriot missile and its launcher, was turning in Xindian District, New Taipei City. It seemed to get stuck near a shop's rain cover because the turn was too tight. Because they worried about damaging it, the truck stayed in the same spot for two hours.

The Air Force headquarters released a statement, saying that their anti-aircraft unit was moving vehicles when the event happened. The driver noticed that there was not enough space between the truck and a rain shelter by the road. They stopped at once. With help from the police, the truck got free, and there was no damage to anyone's property.

The Air Force also said they will keep telling their units to check the areas carefully when they move, to make sure everything is safe. They also thanked the public and the police for helping them during the exercise.

**Control Yuan Asks Courts to Agree on "Major Case" Rules**

Members of the Control Yuan, Wang Mei-yu and Yeh Ta-hua, have asked courts and prosecutors to agree on what makes a case "important and highly watched." They believe this will help protect people's rights and make the justice system work better and faster.

The two members recently looked into a case where a former chairman of a company was allowed to leave without paying bail and then seemed to disappear. This made people question if the court was slow or if prosecutors didn't use technology to watch him. The Control Yuan has approved their report on this matter.

The Control Yuan members said that making strict rules for how long courts have to finish a case might not be practical. While it could stop accused people from hiding evidence or running away, courts also need time to handle cases with many people, complex details, and time for lawyers to read documents.

They also mentioned that if a court believes someone is not guilty, it cannot use technology to watch that person. They respect the court's choice in the specific case they investigated.

The members of the Control Yuan also pointed out that different courts and prosecutor's offices have different ideas about what an "important and highly watched case" is. This difference can affect how quickly and clearly decisions are made about keeping people in jail before trial. So, they need to have one clear standard to protect human rights and ensure the justice system is efficient.

They also believe that having special courts just for deciding about things like keeping someone in jail, searching places, or stopping people from leaving the country would make decisions clearer and fairer. The Judicial Yuan should continue to support these special courts and check how well they work.

Lastly, to stop accused people from running away when courts and prosecutors don't agree on keeping them in custody, there were ideas in the past to hold them longer during appeals. But the situation is different now. Just giving courts a time limit might not stop people from hiding or escaping and might not be practical. A more basic change to the system is needed.
