<a href="https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/semicon-taiwan-%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8E%E9%AB%94%E5%91%A8-201000087.html">News Link</a>

The global semiconductor industry's annual event, "SEMICON Taiwan 2025," officially started on the 17th. Marking its 30th anniversary, SEMI, the International Semiconductor Industry Association, announced that the exhibition will be upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week." Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the US-China tech war, with Trump pressing allies to bring companies back with high tariffs, major manufacturers like TSMC face even greater pressure to invest in the US. In the future, semiconductor companies will be forced to "pick sides," and supply chains will accelerate regional reorganization. Semiconductors have shifted from being commercial goods to strategic assets, with decision-making moving from "market efficiency" to "national security resilience."

With "Leading with Collaboration. Innovating with the World." as the theme for SEMICON Taiwan 2025, this year marks the debut of International Semiconductor Week. Key international forums will be held on September 8th and 9th, followed by the exhibition from September 10th to 12th. Cao Shi-lun, SEMI Global Chief Marketing Officer and President of SEMI Taiwan, stated that in the first quarter of 2025, global semiconductor equipment shipments reached $32.05 billion, a 21% year-on-year increase, mainly driven by the growing demand for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and edge computing applications, showing strong growth momentum.

However, he also stated that the industry faces challenges like supply chain restructuring and geopolitical issues. The US government is using methods such as equipment embargoes (ASML), talent cut-offs (US experts), and supply chain decoupling, forcing companies to "pick a side." Semiconductor industry professionals believe that with accelerated regional reorganization of supply chains, they need to re-evaluate production and investment plans to deal with policy risks and geopolitical uncertainties.

Regarding ongoing semiconductor tariffs, relevant industry players noted that according to Section 232 of the Commerce Department's regulations, after the Commerce Secretary initiated an investigation on April 1st this year, a report must be submitted within 270 days, meaning it will be released by December 27th at the latest. The US President then has 90 days after receiving the report to make a decision, which means the semiconductor tariff deadline will fall around March 27th next year. However, the actual situation may vary due to political considerations or the complexity of the investigation.

Diversifying operations is the best approach. TSMC, as the leading wafer foundry, is increasing its investment in the US to meet customer demand. Industry players stated that geopolitical factors are driving supply chain independence, which helps support demand for semiconductor equipment. In addition, the demand from AI/HPC applications is driving the adoption of advanced manufacturing processes (GAA), the growth of HBM demand, and the development of advanced packaging technologies, which will also increase investment in semiconductor equipment.

**US Added Over 1,000 New Millionaires a Day Last Year, UBS Report Says**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-added-over-1-000-090239309.html">News Link</a>

ZURICH (Reuters) - Wealth grew at an exceptionally fast rate last year in the United States, where over 379,000 individuals became new U.S. dollar millionaires. This amounts to more than a thousand new millionaires every day, according to a report released on Wednesday.

The net worth of private individuals globally increased by 4.6%, and by over 11% in the Americas. This growth was driven by a stable U.S. dollar and strong financial markets, as detailed in the 2025 Global Wealth Report by UBS. The United States accounted for almost 40% of the world's millionaires in 2024.

In 2023, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa had led a recovery in global wealth after a decrease in 2022.

Greater Chinaâ€”which the report defined as mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwanâ€”led last year for individuals with a net worth between $100,000 and $1 million, making up 28.2% of this group. Western Europe followed with 25.4%, and North America with 20.9%.

However, the majority of people worldwide were below that financial level, with over 80% of adults in the UBS study having a net worth under $100,000. Overall, about 1.6% of the surveyed adults had a net worth of $1 million or more, the report indicated.

Over the next five years, the Swiss bank predicts that the average wealth per adult will continue to grow, primarily led by the United States, and to a lesser extent, Greater China.

**Taiwan is 'of course' a country, president says in rebuke to China**

<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te stated on Sunday that Taiwan is "of course" a country. He argued that China lacks both historical and legal evidence to support its claims of sovereignty over the island, strongly rejecting Beijing's increasing political and military pressure.

China views democratically-governed Taiwan as "sacred" Chinese territory, asserting it has belonged to China since ancient times and is merely one of its provinces, with no right to be called a state.

President Lai and his administration firmly reject this perspective and have repeatedly offered talks with China, which have been declined. China labels Lai a "separatist."

In the first of a series of ten speeches titled "uniting the country," Lai discussed Taiwan's history, including the ancient connection of its indigenous people to other Austronesian groups, such as native Hawaiians. He used this to illustrate what he believes is Taiwan's distinct development separate from China.

He added that the people of Taiwan have a history of resisting invasion, citing uprisings against Japan's colonial rule from 1895-1945. Furthermore, under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for a mere eight years.

"Of course, Taiwan is a country," Lai declared during a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, also highlighting its presidential elections. "But China insists that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of business hours. China maintains that the 1971 United Nations resolution, which removed Taipei's seat and gave it to Beijing, serves as one of the legal foundations for its claims.

Lai, who in March referred to China as a "hostile foreign force," asserted that Beijing's claim about the U.N. resolution being related to Taiwan's sovereignty was "totally wrong," as the resolution only addressed which government was represented at the organization.

Lai also emphasized that China's threat to Taiwan is real, pointing to Beijing's daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone approve of this?" he asked, receiving applause.

The defeated Republic of China government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists, and this remains the island's official name.
