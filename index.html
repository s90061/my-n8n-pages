            <h1>Trump Again Says Putin Disappoints Him; UK PM Starmer Asks for More Pressure on Russia</h1>
            <p>There has not been much progress in stopping the war between Russia and Ukraine. US President Trump said today that Russian President Putin has disappointed him. Trump said, "He is killing many people, and he is losing more people than he is killing." Trump also said that if oil prices go down, Putin will have no choice but to stop the war. The UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, also said that countries must put more pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump is on a state visit to the UK. Today, he met with Keir Starmer at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country home, which is about 1.5 hours' drive from London. They held a joint press conference. Earlier, they signed a technology partnership agreement. This agreement will make the two countries work more closely on artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and nuclear energy.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked how to make the Russia-Ukraine war stop, Trump said that Vladimir Putin disappointed him. Trump said, "He is killing many people, and he is losing more people than he is killing... Russian soldiers are dying more than Ukrainian soldiers."</p>
            <p>Starmer also pointed out that Putin recently showed his true intentions. Russia launched its biggest attacks on Ukraine since the war started, killing more innocent people. Also, Russian drones flew into the airspace of NATO countries. Starmer said, "These actions are not what a person who wants peace would do."</p>
            <p>He emphasized that more pressure must be put on Russia. To help Ukraine, the UK and France are working together. They are ready to lead this support and do what is needed.</p>
            <p>Before, Trump said that if all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil, he would put "big punishments" on Russia. Today, he also said that if oil prices fall, Putin will have no choice but "to leave that war." Trump hopes there will be good news soon.</p>
            <p>Starmer admitted that this is a problem for Europe. Some European countries use too much energy from Russia. "But we really need to try harder and work with our European friends," he said.</p>
            <p>News reports said that since Russia fully attacked Ukraine in 2022, the European Union (27 countries) has stopped most Russian oil imports. Now, only Hungary and Slovakia still buy Russian oil. These two countries are friendly with Russia and Trump.</p>

            <p>Starmer said that this investment "will make us richer and more free." He added that it shows the United States and the United Kingdom are determined to win this race together.</p>
            <p>He also stated, "We are asking companies to join us."</p>

            <h1>Three Typhoons Form in One Day; Hpakasa May Become a Medium Typhoon and Be Closest to Taiwan on Sept 23-24</h1>
            <p>After Typhoon Mita formed this afternoon, two tropical low-pressure areas became Typhoons Hpakasa and Kajiki tonight. These were the 21st and 22nd tropical low-pressure areas of the year. The Central Weather Administration (CWA) says that Typhoon Hpakasa might get stronger and become a medium typhoon when it gets near Taiwan. A warning for ships at sea could be announced as early as the afternoon of September 21.</p>
            <p>The CWA said that Typhoon Mita, the 17th typhoon this year, formed this afternoon. It is expected to move northwest towards Guangdong, China. It is not likely to directly hit Taiwan, but its outer winds will affect Taiwan's weather.</p>
            <p>The CWA announced tonight that two new typhoons have formed. The 21st tropical low-pressure area, which was west of Guam, became Typhoon Hpakasa (the 18th typhoon this year). The 22nd tropical low-pressure area, which was northwest of Wake Island, also became a light typhoon, Typhoon Kajiki (the 19th typhoon this year). With these two new typhoons, a total of three typhoons formed in one day.</p>
            <p>The CWA said that Typhoon Hpakasa is expected to move west-northwest. It will be near the sea northeast of the Philippines starting on September 21. A sea typhoon warning might be issued as early as the afternoon of September 21.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Hpakasa will start to get close to Taiwan on September 22. Its outer winds will cause weather changes. The CWA said that Hpakasa will be closest to Taiwan from September 23 to the morning of September 24. When it is close, it might get stronger and become a medium typhoon.</p>
            <p>The CWA pointed out that because of Typhoon Hpakasa and its outer winds, the eastern and southeastern parts of Taiwan, and the Hengchun Peninsula, are likely to have showers or thunderstorms from September 23 to the morning of September 24. The rain will last a longer time, and there is a chance of heavy rain or very heavy rain in some areas. Also, the northern, northeastern, and southern parts of Taiwan, and the mountain areas in the middle of Taiwan, will have short showers or thunderstorms. Northeastern Taiwan, Pingtung, and other mountain areas might also have heavy rain.</p>
            <p>As for Typhoon Kajiki, the CWA said it is expected to move west-northwest towards Japan and will not directly affect Taiwan.</p>
