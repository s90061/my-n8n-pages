            <h1>US Interest Rate Cut Unclear, European Stocks Show Mixed Results</h1>
            <p>News from London on August 5th: New information shows that prices in the United States are going up faster. This makes it harder to know if interest rates will go down soon. Because of this, the stock markets in Europe did not all move in the same direction today. Some went up, and some went down.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up a little bit, by 14.43 points, which is 0.16%. It closed at 9142.73 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up by 88.38 points, which is 0.37%. It closed at 23846.07 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 10.97 points, which is 0.14%. It closed at 7621.04 points.</p>

            <h1>US and Ukraine Plan Drone Partnership, Nordic Countries Give 500 Million Euros in Aid</h1>
            <p>Kyiv, August 5th: Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said today that Ukraine and the United States have finished a first plan for working together on drones. They will talk more about the details later. Mr. Zelenskyy had earlier said this plan could be worth as much as 10 billion US dollars (about 298.8 billion New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Mr. Zelenskyy shared on social media that he talked with US President Donald Trump. They discussed how Ukraine and the US can work together on defense, including the drone project. He said this could be "one of the most important agreements."</p>
            <p>Mr. Zelenskyy also said that during the call, they talked about Russia's recent big air attacks. He noted that Mr. Trump fully understood Russia's attacks on Kyiv. They also discussed what actions could be taken against Russia. Mr. Zelenskyy stated, "If Russia had not purposely made the war longer, it should have ended months ago."</p>
            <p>Last month, the "New York Post" in the US reported that Mr. Zelenskyy said in an interview that Ukraine and the US were talking about working together on drones. Ukraine planned to give the US its drone technology, which has been tested in real war, in exchange for weapons made in the US. Mr. Zelenskyy called this a "win-win" situation.</p>
            <p>Also, after the Netherlands became the first NATO country to say it would buy weapons directly from the US, Mr. Zelenskyy said today that Sweden, Norway, and Denmark will also give military help worth 500 million Euros (about 17.3 billion New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>NATO, Ukraine, and the US recently created a new way to work together. They will use a list called "Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List" (PURL) to arrange for the US-made weapons Ukraine needs.</p>
            <p>With this system, Ukraine will list the weapons it needs most. Each time, about 500 million US dollars in aid will be given. NATO member countries, with the help of Secretary General Mark Rutte, will decide which country will give or buy the necessary military equipment.</p>

            <h1>Trump: No Meeting with Xi Jinping Without a Trade Deal</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 5th: People are wondering when US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet. Today, President Trump said that if the US and China make a trade agreement, he will probably meet with Mr. Xi Jinping before the end of the year. But if they do not make a deal, he will not meet Mr. Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump also said that they are very close to reaching an agreement.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump was on a phone interview with CNBC, a business news channel, for the program Squawk Box. When asked about meeting Mr. Xi Jinping, he said that Mr. Xi Jinping asked to meet him. If the US and China agree on a trade deal, he will likely meet Mr. Xi Jinping before the end of this year. He stated, "If we don't have a deal, there will be no meeting."</p>
            <p>He also said, "What is the point of meeting if both sides will not agree?" But he also stressed that the US and China are now very close to making a deal. He added, "We are getting along very well with China."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he thinks the US and China are ready to make a deal. Before this, US and Chinese officials had their third round of trade talks in Sweden at the end of July. They were trying to solve their economic problems. Their goal was to make the current pause on tariffs, which started in mid-May, last longer.</p>
            <p>In May, the US and China had talks in Geneva and made an agreement. Both sides greatly lowered high tariffs for 90 days. This break in the trade conflict will end on August 12th.</p>
            <p>The US and China had already made initial agreements in May and June. They were trying to stop the actions of putting tariffs on each other and to prevent China from stopping its export of rare earth minerals. Now, with the August 12th deadline coming soon, China needs to make a lasting tariff agreement with the United States.</p>
