            <h1>Tai San Company Asks Jiekou Company to Return Money: Court Case Continues on September 1st</h1>
            <p>Tai San Company's new leaders went to court to ask Jiekou Financial Technology to return almost 3.6 billion New Taiwan dollars. Tai San won the first court case. Today, the second court case started. Jiekou Company said that the first court's decision had big mistakes and should be canceled. The judge said there are many questions about whether Jiekou, which collected the money, must return it. The case will continue to be discussed on September 1st.</p>
            <p>On May 5, 2023, the old leaders of Tai San Company held a meeting. They decided to buy 40.39% of Jiekou Financial Technology, the parent company of Jiekou Electronic Payment, for 3.6 billion New Taiwan dollars. The new leaders of Tai San say that this meeting's decision was against the law and not valid. They also say that agreements signed by the former representative, Zhan Jing-chao, with Jiekou Financial Technology and others do not apply to Tai San.</p>
            <p>On August 30, 2023, Tai San sued Jiekou Financial Technology to get back their investment money, about 3.5958 billion New Taiwan dollars. The Taipei District Court decided in May of this year that Tai San won. Jiekou Financial Technology must return all the money plus 5% interest each year. If Tai San gives 1.1986 billion New Taiwan dollars as a guarantee, they can start to collect the money.</p>
            <p>Tai San then gave over 1.1 billion New Taiwan dollars to the Taipei District Court as a guarantee. They asked the court to freeze Jiekou Financial Technology's bank accounts. Because this did not work, they tried to freeze Jiekou Financial Technology's other properties. On the 10th, a court officer from the Taipei District Court went to freeze Jiekou's assets.</p>
            <p>Jiekou Financial Technology was not happy with the first decision and appealed. The Taiwan High Court is hearing the second case, and it started today.</p>
            <p>Jiekou Financial Technology's lawyer said that the first court's decision had big mistakes. They asked the court to cancel the decision and send the case back for a new trial. They also said they tried to use a "set-off" defense during the first trial, but the decision did not explain why it was not accepted. They want the court to finish the case quickly.</p>
            <p>Tai San's lawyer said that Jiekou collected the money for Dorian Company. If Jiekou could not complete the necessary steps with the Investment Commission, they should return the money to Tai San. This process was not finished, so Jiekou must return the money. Jiekou was holding this money for both sides. Where the money goes depends on whether the Investment Commission's process is completed. Tai San's lawyer also said that Jiekou mentioned "set-off" before, but they have not used this defense for a year and a half.</p>
            <p>The judge asked both sides to explain, using a table, how Tai San signed two agreements: a "share purchase agreement" and a "new share subscription agreement." They also need to list any proof.</p>
            <p>The judge pointed out that there are many important questions. These include how Tai San's board meeting made decisions about the two agreements (including how the meeting was called and if the decisions are valid), if the former representative Zhan Jing-chao had limits on his power, if Jiekou was a fair trading partner, and what the legal relationship and duty to return the money are for Jiekou after they received it. The judge asked both sides to get their information ready. The case will continue to be heard on September 1st at 4:00 PM.</p>

            <h1>Many Villages in Yunlin County Flooded; Chiang Wan-an Calls to Show Concern and Offer Help</h1>
            <p>Because of a low-pressure area and southwest winds, Yunlin County had over 300 millimeters of rain by 11 AM today. Beigang area had serious flooding, and many villages were under water. Yunlin County Mayor Chang Li-shan visited the affected areas today and said that Taipei City Mayor Chiang Wan-an called to show he cared and offered to help.</p>
            <p>The Weather Bureau issued a heavy rain warning. Because of a low-pressure area and southwest winds, there will be strong short-term rain. Today, Yunlin, Chiayi County, Chiayi City, and Tainan will have local heavy or very heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Many villages in Shui-lin Township are under water. Today, Chang Li-shan, with Shui-lin Township acting mayor Chang Dong-kai and Water Resources Department director Hsu Hong-bo, visited Ciaosung, Songbei villages, and Beichen Elementary School in Shui-lin Township to check the damage. She told the relevant departments to work hard to help with draining water and fixing things. Some homes were flooded, so residents moved all their belongings to higher places to reduce financial losses.</p>
            <p>Chang Li-shan said that the Ciaosung area of Shui-lin Township received over 300 millimeters of rain from midnight until 11 AM today. This large amount of rain in a short time, plus the ground sinking over time, made the drainage system unable to handle the water, causing serious flooding.</p>
            <p>Chang Li-shan asked the county government to fully get ready. They put many water pumps in areas that easily flood and quickly brought in their own pumping machines from within the county to help. Chang Li-shan also said that Chiang Wan-an called specially to show he cared and offered to help if Yunlin County did not have enough equipment.</p>
            <p>Hsu Hong-bo said that according to Chen Guo-yuan, the Songbei Village chief, it started raining from 12 AM today. The strongest rain was from 3 AM to 7 AM. During this time alone, over 200 millimeters of rain fell. By 11 AM, the total rain was over 300 millimeters. This is considered very strong rain, and it is much more than the usual flood protection standards. So, it was expected that there would be flooding.</p>
            <p>Because of the heavy rain, the Yunlin County Disaster Response Center started its second level of operations. Related departments are closely watching the water levels and rain, and are ready to act at any time.</p>
