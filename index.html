**Starbucks to Roll Out Olive Oil-Infused Coffee 'Oleato' Across the US**

Starbucks is expanding its olive oil-infused coffee line, Oleato, to all of its US stores after initial launches in select markets like Chicago and Seattle. The coffee chain hopes this innovative beverage will attract new customers and boost sales. The Oleato drinks, which blend Starbucks arabica coffee with Partanna extra virgin olive oil, have been met with mixed reactions. Some customers praise the smooth, rich flavor, while others find the texture unusual. Despite the divided opinions, Starbucks is confident that Oleato will become a popular addition to its menu. The company is investing heavily in marketing the new line, highlighting the health benefits of olive oil and the unique sensory experience of the drink. Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz, believes Oleato represents the next big innovation in coffee and could revolutionize the industry.

**AI-Powered Tool Predicts Potential Heart Attack Risk Years in Advance**

Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence tool that can predict a person's risk of having a heart attack up to five years before it happens. The AI analyzes medical images, specifically CT scans of the heart, to identify subtle changes in arteries that are often missed by the human eye. This early detection system could allow doctors to implement preventative measures, such as lifestyle changes and medication, to significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks. The AI has been tested on thousands of patients and has shown impressive accuracy, outperforming traditional risk assessment methods. The developers hope that this technology will become widely available to help save lives and reduce the burden of heart disease on healthcare systems. While the tool shows great promise, further research is needed to validate its effectiveness across diverse populations.

**Italy Introduces New Rules to Combat Overtourism in Popular Destinations**

Italy is implementing stricter regulations aimed at tackling overtourism in its most visited cities, including Venice and Rome. These new rules include limiting the size of tour groups, banning loudspeakers on guided tours, and introducing entrance fees to certain attractions. The goal is to protect historic sites from damage and improve the quality of life for local residents. Venice, in particular, has struggled with the influx of tourists, leading to overcrowding and environmental concerns. The city is experimenting with a reservation system and a daily fee for day-trippers. Other popular destinations are considering similar measures to manage visitor numbers and preserve their cultural heritage. Critics argue that these restrictions could negatively impact tourism revenue, but authorities believe they are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry and the preservation of Italy's cultural treasures.
