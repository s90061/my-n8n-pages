            <h1>Southwest Winds Influence, Kaohsiung and Pingtung Mountain Areas Should Prepare for Heavy Rain or Torrential Rain</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration has given a heavy rain warning. Because of the southwest winds, there will likely be strong, short-time rainfall. Today, the mountain areas of Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County may have heavy rain or very heavy rain in some places. There is also a chance of heavy rain in some parts of Penghu, Kinmen, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and the mountain areas from Nantou to Tainan.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration reminds people to watch out for lightning and strong winds. In low-lying areas, be careful of water collecting and flooding. Because it has been raining for many days, people in mountain areas should be careful of loose soil, landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides. You should not go to mountain areas.</p>

            <h1>Trump's New Tariffs Coming Soon; Experts Expect Taiwan to Reach Agreement with US Before August 7th</h1>
            <p>On July 31st, US President Trump announced new tax rates on goods that will start on August 7th. These new taxes include a 20% tax on goods from Taiwan. But talks between Taiwan and the US are still happening. Some experts from other countries believe that places like Taiwan or India might reach an agreement within the seven-day period.</p>
            <p>News from AFP says that Trump often sets deadlines for trade but then cancels or changes them. This has led to people saying, "Trump always backs down." But experts think he will not back down this time.</p>
            <p>Matthew Aks, an expert on public policy at Evercore ISI, said that he does not expect big changes to the new order. However, some places like Taiwan or India might make a deal in the seven days.</p>
            <p>Josh Lipsky, an international economics expert from the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, also believes that Trump "is not backing down." He is "keeping and even going beyond" the promises he made about taxes during his election campaign.</p>
            <p>Before announcing the new tax rates, Trump had difficult talks and made many compromises. The most important ones were making agreements with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. Trump set different tax rates and said that the US would get a lot of investment.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te wrote on Facebook that the US's new tax policy had reached a good point. The US government told them that the tax rate was lowered from 32% to 20%. But the final meeting has not happened yet, so the final tax rate is not decided. This is why the 20% tax is "temporary."</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chiun, the Vice Premier of Taiwan, and her team recently had more talks in Washington about the new US tax rates. She returned to Taiwan this morning and said, "The talks must continue. We will keep working hard to get a better tax rate."</p>

            <h1>Financial Holding Companies' Overseas Exposure Drops to NT$27 Trillion, Biggest Quarterly Decrease Ever</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has reported that by the end of the second quarter, the total money that financial holding groups had risked overseas was 27.02 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. This amount went down by 2.09 trillion New Taiwan Dollars in just one quarter, which is a decrease of 7.2%. This is the biggest decrease ever since they started collecting data in 2015. This happened because the New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger in the second quarter. Out of this, 9.56 trillion New Taiwan Dollars were risked in the United States, which is still the country where financial groups risk the most money. However, the amount risked in the US as a part of all overseas money went down to 35.39%.</p>
            <p>Since the second quarter of 2015, the FSC has been sharing information every three months about the money that financial holding groups risk both in Taiwan and overseas. This includes money lent to other banks, loans given, and total investments.</p>
            <p>In the first quarter of this year, the total overseas money risked by financial holding groups reached a new high of 29.12 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. But when the amount of overseas money, which is in US dollars, was changed back to New Taiwan Dollars, the strong increase of 10.97% in the New Taiwan Dollar's value in the second quarter also changed the overseas risk numbers.</p>
            <p>The FSC's data shows that by the end of the second quarter, the overseas money risked by financial holding groups went down to 27.02 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. This was a large decrease of 2.09 trillion New Taiwan Dollars in one quarter. However, the total money risked by financial holding groups in Taiwan kept going up to 47.56 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, an increase of 1.12 trillion in one quarter. The total money risked both in Taiwan and overseas was 74,587.971 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is 974.503 billion less than the previous quarter.</p>
            <p>Looking at the top 10 countries or areas where financial holding groups risk money overseas, they are the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. Compared to the first quarter, only the money risked in Japan increased. The money risked in all other countries decreased.</p>
            <p>The money risked in the United States is 9,563.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is still the highest. But the money risked by financial groups in the US went below 10 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, with a big decrease of 792.3 billion in one quarter. This is the biggest decrease for US risk in one quarter. The part of total overseas money risked in the US also went down a little, from 35.56% to 35.39%. Compared to the first quarter of this year, both loans and investments went down. However, changes in exchange rates also played a part.</p>
            <p>Next, China is still the second biggest country for financial holding groups to risk money overseas. By the end of the second quarter, the total money risked by financial holding groups in China was 1,895.8 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is the lowest amount ever recorded, and it is the first time it went below 2 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. It decreased by 149.9 billion in one quarter. If we look at why this changed, we see that net investments, net loans, and money lent to other banks all went down.</p>
            <p>Among the top 10 overseas risk countries, financial holding groups risked 1,127.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars in Japan. This was an increase of 12.309 billion in one quarter, mainly because net investments increased. Because of this, Japan moved up to 6th place, passing South Korea again. Financial holding groups risked 1,073.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars in South Korea, placing it 7th. This was a decrease of 52.536 billion in one quarter.</p>
