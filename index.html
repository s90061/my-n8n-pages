            <h1>Ukraine Finds Defense Corruption Case: Electronic Warfare and Drone Prices Overcharged</h1>
            <p>(Kyiv, August 2nd, Central News Agency) Ukrainian authorities said today that they have arrested several politicians. These politicians are involved in a large corruption case in the defense department. This happened after public protests began because the independence of Ukraine's two main anti-corruption agencies was taken away. After these protests, the parliament passed a new anti-corruption law.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Ukraine passed a law at the end of July this year. This law took away the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO). It gave control to the Prosecutor General, who is chosen by the country's leader.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave in on July 31st. He gave back the independence of these two agencies. This happened after strong disagreement from allied countries and the first street protests against the government in Ukraine since Russia's full invasion in 2022.</p>
            <p>The National Anti-Corruption Bureau stated today that it, along with the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office, found "a case of regularly taking money that local governments set aside for the army's needs, and also a large amount of illegally taking and giving money."</p>
            <p>The National Anti-Corruption Bureau said that this corruption case involves charging too much for electronic warfare and drone equipment. Then, 30% of the contract money was taken for other uses.</p>
            <p>The people suspected in this case include a member of parliament, several heads of regional and city offices, members of the National Guard, and managers of defense companies.</p>
            <p>The National Anti-Corruption Bureau noted that they have made 4 arrests so far, but they have not shared the names of the people arrested.</p>
