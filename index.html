UK inflation has dropped to 3.9% in November, according to the Office for National Statistics, a bigger fall than most experts predicted. This is good news for families struggling with the rising cost of living, and it might make the Bank of England think about cutting interest rates sooner than planned. Lower inflation means things aren't getting more expensive as quickly as they were, which could help people feel more confident about their spending.

The fall was mainly due to cheaper petrol and diesel prices, as well as a slower increase in food prices compared to last year. While the headline rate is down, core inflation, which excludes energy and food, also decreased. This suggests that underlying price pressures in the economy are easing. The Bank of England will be closely monitoring these figures as it decides whether to raise or lower interest rates in the coming months.

The government welcomed the news, stating that it shows their plan to tackle inflation is working. However, they also acknowledged that there is still work to be done to bring inflation back to the target of 2%. Some economists warn that it's too early to celebrate, as global events could still push prices up again.

**Title: Innovative Startup Tackles Food Waste with AI**

A new startup is using artificial intelligence to help restaurants and supermarkets reduce food waste. The company, called "WasteNot," has developed a system that uses cameras and sensors to track the types and amounts of food being thrown away. This data is then analyzed by AI algorithms to identify patterns and predict future waste.

WasteNot provides businesses with recommendations on how to optimize their ordering, preparation, and storage practices to minimize waste. For example, the system might suggest adjusting portion sizes or changing menu items based on customer demand. The startup claims that its technology can reduce food waste by up to 30%, saving businesses money and helping the environment.

Several restaurants and supermarkets have already adopted WasteNot's system, and the results have been promising. One restaurant reported a 20% decrease in food costs after implementing the recommendations provided by the AI. The company is now planning to expand its operations to other countries and develop new features, such as a system for connecting businesses with excess food to local charities.

**Title: Machu Picchu Announces New Visitor Limits to Protect Ancient Site**

Peruvian authorities have announced new restrictions on the number of visitors allowed to enter Machu Picchu each day. This is to protect the ancient Inca citadel from damage caused by over-tourism. From January 2024, the maximum number of daily visitors will be reduced by 10%, and new time slots will be introduced to manage the flow of people more effectively.

The move comes after years of concerns about the impact of tourism on the site's fragile environment and historical structures. Experts have warned that the constant flow of visitors is causing erosion and damaging the stones. The new regulations aim to strike a balance between allowing people to experience Machu Picchu and preserving it for future generations.

Visitors will now need to book their tickets in advance for a specific time slot, and tour guides will be required to follow strict routes and limits on group sizes. The authorities are also investing in new infrastructure to improve visitor management, such as new restrooms and rest areas. While some tourism operators have expressed concerns about the impact on their businesses, most agree that the changes are necessary to protect this important cultural heritage site.
