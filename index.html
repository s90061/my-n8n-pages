<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8837479">https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8837479</a>

Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of accepted universities and colleges from mainland China. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been removed from this list. This change means there are now 154 universities and 191 colleges still recognized.
The Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-Yao, said earlier this year that schools controlled by China's United Front Work Department are not truly academic. He stated it was important to stop working with them, and Taiwan would no longer accept degrees from these schools. The Ministry of Education removed Jinan University because it has been managed by China's United Front Work Department since 2019. They believe students should learn in a normal academic setting without specific political goals.
The Ministry also stressed that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair and respectful. Schools that arrange exchange trips to China should follow Taiwan's rules. They should be careful of events organized by China that have political aims or spread political messages. Schools should not accept free trips or help with political advertising from China. If schools are unsure about an event or its organizers, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for help. The Ministry hopes to continue exchanges for young students to learn from each other, but reminds everyone to be aware of possible risks, especially regarding the political goals of the organizers.

**Car Catches Fire on Kinmen Bridge for the First Time: Video Shows It Became a Fireball**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7320/8837477">https://udn.com/news/story/7320/8837477</a>

Today, for the first time, a car caught fire on the Kinmen Bridge at 2:16 PM. A car likely had a tire blowout, which made it lose control and hit the middle divider. It then caught fire. The driver and one passenger safely got out of the car and were not hurt. Police and firefighters arrived quickly, stopped traffic, and put out the fire. The car was completely burned. The police are now looking into why the accident happened.
The Kinmen County Fire Department got a call at 2:10 PM about a car on fire at the Kinmen Bridge. They sent four fire trucks and 12 firefighters. When they got there, the car was stuck on the divider and on fire, but the people inside had already escaped. Firefighters quickly used water hoses to put out the fire and cool the car down.
Police found that the driver, Mr. Lin, heard a tire burst while driving towards Lieyu. His car then slid, hit the divider, and caught fire for an unknown reason. A breathalyzer test showed the driver had no alcohol in his system.
After the accident, one lane of the bridge was closed to traffic. Later, the car was moved, and the road was cleaned. Then, both lanes were reopened.
The fire department advises drivers to always check their car and keep a safe distance from other vehicles. If there is a car accident or fire, call 119 right away and clearly explain what happened and if anyone is hurt.
Kinmen police also advise drivers what to do if a tire blows out: do not brake suddenly. Instead, take your foot off the gas, keep the steering wheel steady, turn on your hazard lights, and try to slowly move to the side of the road. If you cannot control the car, you can rub against the guardrail to slow down and avoid flipping over. If your car stops by the road after an accident, follow seven steps to keep everyone safe, especially at night or in bad visibility. You should place a warning sign further away to alert other drivers.

**"Couldn't Even Cry from Fear": Lu Pei Xiao Wei Says She Received Threatening Call in Guizhou**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7331/8837460">https://udn.com/news/story/7331/8837460</a>

Xiao Wei, a Chinese spouse, had her residency in Taiwan canceled. She was sent back to Guizhou, China, in April because she was accused of saying things on TikTok that supported China taking Taiwan by force. After returning to China, Xiao Wei started sharing her life in the countryside. But she continued to speak her mind. She recently made a video saying that a village leader in Guizhou's Guanzhou Town had not given her money for land that was flooded by a dam. Now, she says she received a threatening phone call late at night from the Chinese police. She cried and said, "I am really scared, so scared that I couldn't even cry."
Xiao Wei posted a video on TikTok today saying she is very scared. She said she is a farmer and a good person who has not broken any laws. She only asked the village committee why she had not received her compensation money. Then, on June 28th, around midnight, she got a threatening call from the Guanzhou police station.
In the video, Xiao Wei stated that she is a good farmer and cannot handle being scared. She questioned why the police called her and on what grounds they were giving her a warning. She said she was shaking while filming the video and asked if there was still justice. She angrily told the police, "How do you work as officers in a police station? Is this how you treat farmers? Calling to show off your power?"
Xiao Wei said she was truly very scared, so scared she could not cry. At the end of her video, she asked for help, saying, "Please, relevant government offices, protect us farmers. The more I think about it, the more scared I get. We farmers have no powerful friends, so we can only use the internet to ask for justice. Please pay attention to our situation."`;
