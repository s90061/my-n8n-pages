            <h1>Tseng Chun-hsin Loses in US Open Men's Singles First Round, Still Waiting for First Grand Slam Win</h1>
            <p>After three years, Tseng Chun-hsin, "Taiwan's No. 1," played in the US Open again. Today, he played in the first round of men's singles. Sadly, he lost to Belgium's good player Bergs with scores of 3-6, 4-6, 3-6. He will have to wait longer for his first win in a Grand Slam main draw.</p>
            <p>The US Open is the last of the four big tennis tournaments. Tseng Chun-hsin, ranked 118th in the world, got a direct spot in the men's singles main draw this time. He is the only hope for Taiwan in singles. In the first round, he played against Zizou Bergs from Belgium, who is ranked 48th in the world. Tseng wanted to get his first win in a Grand Slam main draw.</p>
            <p>Tseng went into the match wanting to attack his opponent. In the first set, Tseng fought hard with Bergs. But in the 8th game, Tseng's serve was broken, and he lost the set 3-6. Luckily, Tseng adjusted well in the second set. He used the chance when Bergs' serves were not good and was leading 4-2. But then, Tseng also had problems with his serve. His serve was broken twice, and he lost the set 4-6.</p>
            <p>Tseng had no choice but to fight hard in the third set. But he still could not play well. He lost his serve twice and was far behind at 1-5. Even though he broke Bergs' serve back and tried to keep the match going, he hit the net when trying to volley. So, he lost the match 3-6. He cannot go to the second round of the US Open men's singles, and he is still waiting for his first Grand Slam main draw win.</p>
