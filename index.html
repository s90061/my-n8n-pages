            <h1>北投國中女壘奪冠 北市將再投百萬獎勵及補助</h1>
            <p>Taipei City Education Bureau said today that the Beitou Junior High School girls' softball team won the championship at the 2025 Babe Ruth League U16 Women's Softball World Series. The city quickly congratulated them. They will also give another NT$1 million. This money will be for rewards and special help.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Babe Ruth League U16 Women's Softball World Series took place in Alabama, USA. On August 9th, local time, the Beitou Junior High girls' team played against Puerto Rico. They won the game 12 to 1. This is the first time Taiwan has joined this competition and won.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, and Taiwan's representative in the US, Yu Da-tsai, sent messages right away to congratulate the team for their great success. Ambassador-at-large Liu Po-chun helped the team go to the US. She hopes this trip will encourage the players to "see the world."</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Education Bureau said the team showed amazing skill. They won 7 games in a row. They played against strong softball teams from countries like the United States, Japan, Australia, and Canada. To thank them for bringing honor to Taipei City, the city will provide another NT$1 million. This money will be used for rewards and special support.</p>
            <p>The Education Bureau explained that the money will be used to reward individual players for their good work. It will also recognize the coaches' team effort. The money will also help the school with its needs. This includes making training places better, getting new sports gear, and buying things that are used up quickly. It will also help set up sports protection stations.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Education Bureau said that before the competition, they had already given NT$300,000 to help with travel costs. They also cared for students from poor families on the team. Through a special foundation, they gave an extra NT$114,000 to these students. This, along with the hard work from the school and coaches for a long time, and the students' daily practice, made this excellent result possible.</p>

            <h1>文化世博「魔幻台灣—台灣文學展」大阪登場</h1>
            <p>The event "We TAIWAN Culture in Osaka, Kansai Expo" started today with the "Magical Taiwan - Taiwan Literature Exhibition." Wang Shih-sih, who is the Deputy Minister of Culture, said the exhibition place feels like a magical world. It brings spirits, monsters, and mythical creatures into a classic building. Chen Ying-fang, the head of the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, hopes this literature exhibition will help people in Taiwan and Japan feel a connection. She also hopes it will show the many different kinds of literature in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The exhibition is held at the Osaka City Central Public Hall. This old building was built in 1918 in a Western style. On the ceiling of the exhibition room, there are paintings of Japanese myths. The Taiwan literature exhibition uses three stage-shaped displays that have two sides. These displays show six topics: "Indigenous Culture," "The Influence of Japanese Culture," and "Finding Taiwanese Folklore Again," among others.</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sih said that the Osaka City Central Public Hall is a place full of magic. This very old building fits well with the National Museum of Taiwan Literature. The museum is in the "Tainan State Hall," a historical building from 1916. She said, "Today, we bring ghosts, spirits, and mythical creatures into this space. We also make this place full of good wishes."</p>
            <p>She explained that in Taiwan, the way people and gods relate is special. "We are a country that treats gods like friends." In many books, plays, and poems, you can see people's hopes, desires, things they wanted to do but couldn't, and strong feelings. These feelings become characters in stories and stay in our memory forever.</p>
            <p>She said that when we see these spirits, monsters, and mythical creatures, we can think about them differently. Maybe in literature, they are not really scary. Instead, they might be desires and wishes that could not come true in this life. These wishes have continued in different times and different stories. They have finished their purpose and made the world of humans, gods, ghosts, and mythical beasts complete.</p>
            <p>The National Museum of Taiwan Literature planned this exhibition. Chen Ying-fang said they worked specially with the Tainan City God Temple. This temple is the first City God Temple in Taiwan. When they introduce spirits, monsters, and mythical creatures, they also want to show Japanese visitors how special Taiwanese gods are. Taiwanese gods are not only strong protectors; they also mean good luck and blessings. This unique idea about culture, like Taiwan's literature, is rich and open. It can accept many different ideas and voices.</p>
            <p>She said she hopes that this literature exhibition will help people in Taiwan and Japan feel a connection. At the same time, it will help everyone understand their differences. This is the main idea that she hopes to share with people through this exhibition.</p>
            <p>Chen Ying-fang explained that this literature exhibition starts by talking about indigenous literature. This shows how much Taiwan's literature has grown over time. It not only shows indigenous literature but also includes works by Japanese writers who lived in Taiwan and wrote about it from an outsider's point of view. For example, Nishikawa Mitsuru (1908-1999) and Sato Haruo (1892-1964) showed Taiwan's unique look from different cultural perspectives.</p>
            <p>She also said that the exhibition shows how Taiwanese folk traditions are a very important source for new creative works. It shows how modern writers combine Taiwan's real society and natural environment. They create stories that mix history, nature, and magical realism. Also, Taiwanese poetry is very good. Through different types of works, they hope Japanese visitors can feel the charm of Taiwanese literature, which is like a magic trick with words.</p>
