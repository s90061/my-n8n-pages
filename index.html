<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s overseas branch plans to issue $10 billion in new shares. This is their largest effort yet to manage changes in foreign exchange rates, according to a company statement. This is the third such agreement since 2024, and all have happened when the Taiwan dollar tended to get stronger. These actions give TSMC Globalâ€”which handles overseas investments and currency protectionâ€”more financial freedom to deal with exchange rate risks.

The recent increase in the Taiwan dollar has made people in Taipei concerned about the economy's heavy reliance on exports. In May, the currency had its biggest one-day gain since the 1980s, leading Taiwan's central bank to call for measures to control speculation.

Philip McNicholas, an Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco in Singapore, explained that more currency volatility usually means banks might change their margin requirements. He added that issuing new shares and providing immediate cash could help companies manage these requirements for both current and new hedges.

TSMC, the main chipmaker for companies like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is by far Taiwan's largest company and exporter because most of its production is local. A stronger Taiwan dollar hurts exporters because the US dollars they earn from international sales would convert into less local currency, or they would need to increase their prices abroad, risking a drop in demand.

In June, CEO C. C. Wei informed shareholders that the company's operating profit margin had decreased by several percentage points due to the stronger local currency.

**Taiwan's China Airlines postpones retirement of older planes due to Boeing 787 delays**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-china-airlines-postpones-retirement-051339368.html">News Link</a>

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - China Airlines, Taiwan's national airline, is delaying the removal of some of its older aircraft from service. This is happening because of delays in receiving Boeing 787-9 jets, which might lead to compensation payments from Boeing, according to the airline's new chairman.

China Airlines, established in 1959, is currently updating its fleet. Last year, it split an order for new long-haul aircraft, worth almost $12 billion at list prices, between Boeing and the European company Airbus.

China Airlines has also ordered 24 Boeing 787s for regional and some longer-distance flights. This includes 18 of the 787-9 model and six of the larger 787-10 version.

However, Chairman George Kao stated that China Airlines' plan to replace its older Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s with 787-9s and A321neos is being affected by delays in new aircraft deliveries, especially for the 787-9s.

"We are currently facing a significant impact. Some aircraft that were supposed to be retired or returned at the end of their lease agreements will now stay in service, and their leases will be extended," he told Reuters in an interview at the airline's headquarters in Taoyuan, where Taiwan's main international airport is located.

Boeing has not provided China Airlines with an exact schedule for the 787-9 delays, although it has said that deliveries will "basically" start by the end of 2025, added Kao, who is a trained pilot, started as a flight attendant, and became chairman in March.

"This is stated in the contract," he said, when asked if China Airlines would seek compensation.

"For example, if the delay is caused by issues in the supply chain, Boeing is responsible and must provide some compensation. But if it's not, then there is no compensation. It's all clearly written in the contract."

Boeing did not respond to a request for comment.

Other airlines are experiencing similar problems.

Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global airline organization, recently described predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade as "completely unacceptable."

Despite this, Kao expressed optimism about expansion plans. He mentioned the more fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s ordered last year, which will allow for increased capacity on routes such as New York and London. He also noted a new third terminal at Taoyuan airport, with its first section expected to open later this year.

He also hinted at more aircraft for Mandarin Airlines, a subsidiary that mainly operates domestic flights with ATR-72 turboprops. Mandarin Airlines is being reorganized to focus on regional routes from southern and central Taiwan using new jet aircraft.

"I can discuss this with aircraft lessors," he said, without revealing the specific jet models that might be added. "We have this plan to help Mandarin Airlines grow."

China Airlines competes domestically with its long-time rival EVA Air and the fast-growing Starlux Airlines, which recently ordered 10 additional A350s.

Kao explained that while the Taiwanese market itself is small, transit traffic, a key focus for all three airlines, means that supporting three full-service airlines is not a problem.

He added that Seoul's Incheon airport is too large, making it easy for passengers to get lost, Tokyo's landing fees are too expensive, and Hong Kong has "political issues." In contrast, Taoyuan airport's new terminal will significantly improve the travel experience.

"Our passengers are not all Taiwanese; many are transit. Because Taiwan's location, connecting the Pacific to all of Asia, is really very convenient."
