            <h1>Female Boxer Khelif Appeals Against Gene Test Rule by World Boxing Group</h1>
            <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport said today that Imane Khelif, a female boxer from Algeria, has made an appeal. Last year, she was part of a gender issue at the Paris Olympics. She wants to stop the World Boxing group (WB) from making female boxers take a gene test.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said that World Boxing (WB) decided Imane Khelif could not join their next boxing events. This was because she had not done a first gene test. Khelif does not agree with this decision.</p>
            <p>During the Paris Olympics, Khelif and a good boxer from Taiwan, Lin Yu-ting, both had problems about their gender. Both of them won gold medals in the end. Lin Yu-ting will not be at the WB World Boxing Championships this week in Liverpool, UK.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-ting did all her important tests more than a month ago. She sent the results to World Boxing. Now, World Boxing needs 4 to 6 weeks to talk about the rules. Because of this, Lin Yu-ting cannot join this year's world championships for now.</p>
            <p>Last month, Khelif, who is 26 years old, said that what her old manager said was not true. Her old manager said she had stopped her boxing career.</p>
            <p>Khelif wrote on Facebook, "I want everyone to know that the news about me stopping boxing is wrong."</p>
            <p>She said that her old manager, Nasser Yesfah, "betrayed my trust and my country with untrue and bad words."</p>
            <p>She also said, "This person cannot speak for me anymore."</p>

            <h1>US-India Alliance Against China Changes as Trump Criticizes India's High Taxes</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump said that India puts very high taxes on goods from the US. This happened while India's Prime Minister Modi was showing unity with leaders from China and Russia at a meeting. Trump said India offered to make these taxes zero, but it is too late.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that Prime Minister Modi is in China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting. At this meeting, China's President Xi Jinping talked about his idea for a new world order for safety and money. He said that countries in the "Global South" should be more important. This idea is a direct problem for the US.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the US and India have become better friends. This started during Donald Trump's first time as president. Both countries were worried about China becoming more powerful.</p>
            <p>But when Trump came back to the White House, things changed for the US and India working together against China. India did not stop buying oil from Russia. Because of this, Trump added a 25% tax on goods from India.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social." He said, "Not many people know that we do very little business with India. But India does a lot of business with us. This means they sell many things to us, and they are our biggest buyer. But we sell very few things to them."</p>
            <p>He also said, "India has put very high taxes on our goods until now. These taxes are the highest from any country. Because of this, our businesses cannot easily sell things in India. This is a very unfair situation! Also, India buys most of its oil and army equipment from Russia, not from the US."</p>
            <p>Trump also stated, "Now, India is saying they will make the taxes zero. But it is too late. They should have done this much earlier."</p>
