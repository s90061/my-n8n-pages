Klook, a travel booking website, announced on July 11th that it is working with Hoshino Resorts, a Japanese hotel group. They want to encourage travelers to visit smaller cities in Japan, away from crowded big cities. They will offer special packages that include stays at Hoshino's "Kai" hot spring hotels and JR Passes, making it easier for people to book their trips and transportation.

Over-tourism is a problem around the world, especially in Japan. Many people from Taiwan visit Japan, and Klook wants to help them discover new places. By working with Hoshino Resorts, Klook will promote the beauty of Japan's less-known cities. They also plan to add more Hoshino hotels and use AI to help travelers plan their trips.

A survey by Klook shows that 63% of travelers in Asia prefer to avoid crowded places. In the first half of this year, bookings for less famous Japanese cities like Kunigami (Okinawa), Mie (near Kyoto), and Nagakute (near Nagoya) increased a lot. This shows that Taiwanese travelers are interested in exploring new areas.

**Four Chinese Coast Guard Ships Enter Kinmen Waters for Second Day, Taiwan Coast Guard Drives Them Away**

For two days in a row, four Chinese Coast Guard ships have entered the waters near Kinmen, Taiwan. On July 11th, the same four ships came into Kinmen's waters in the afternoon. The Taiwan Coast Guard said that recently, Chinese Coast Guard ships have been turning off their tracking systems (AIS) to enter secretly.

On July 10th, four Chinese Coast Guard ships turned off their AIS and entered Kinmen's waters. The Taiwan Coast Guard drove them away. The next day, on July 11th, at 2:45 PM, the same four Chinese ships entered again, also with their AIS off. They sailed from west to east near Dadan Island in Kinmen. The Taiwan Coast Guard sent four patrol boats to sail next to them and make them leave. The Chinese ships left by 5 PM.

The Taiwan Coast Guard in Kinmen said that Chinese Coast Guard ships have bothered Kinmen's waters 79 times so far. They often use sneaky methods, like turning off their AIS, to test how the Taiwan Coast Guard reacts. The Taiwan Coast Guard is watching closely and reacting quickly to protect Taiwan's land and keep the country safe.
