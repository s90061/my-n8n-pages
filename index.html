            <h1>Summer Koshien Tournament: School Leaves Due to Bullying, School's "Victim" Stance Criticized</h1>
            <p>A famous baseball high school in Hiroshima, Japan, called Koryo High School, has pulled out of the Summer Koshien baseball tournament. This happened after their first game, which they won. This is the first time a school has left the tournament because of a bullying problem. The school said they received bomb threats and that students were being looked for online. They said they decided to leave to protect students from further harm. But critics say the school is blaming social media to hide its own poor handling of the bullying.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Koryo High School's principal, Hori Masakazu, held a press conference yesterday in Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture. He said that the baseball team's violence was widely shared on social media. The students who did the bullying were identified, and their names and photos were put online. The school dormitory also got a bomb threat. Students were also yelled at on their way to and from school. To "put the safety of students, teachers, staff, and local residents first," they decided to leave the tournament. They also stopped coach Tetsuyuki Nakai from coaching for a while.</p>
            <p>This is the first time in the Spring and Summer Koshien tournaments that a school has left after the start because of a scandal.</p>
            <p>In January this year, there was violence within the Koryo High School baseball team. In March, the Japan High School Baseball Federation (Kohyoren) gave the school a "serious warning." Before the Koshien tournament began, news about the incident was already spreading online. However, because the punishment was finished, Koryo High School still decided to play. Kohyoren also decided that there was "no problem" with them playing.</p>
            <p>The school said that in January this year, four second-year baseball players went to a first-year player's dorm room. They hit him in the chest and slapped him, among other violent acts. The school stated that the four students apologized to the victim. The victim moved to a different school at the end of March. The school first told the Hiroshima Kohyoren and gave them a report. The Japan Kohyoren gave a serious warning in March but did not tell the public about it.</p>
            <p>Koryo High School won its first game against Asahikawa Shino High School on the 7th. However, at the same time, another violent incident was being shared online.</p>
            <p>Koryo High School said at the press conference that a second incident was already being investigated by a third-party committee in June. But it kept getting negative comments online. The school felt that "this would stop the tournament from working well and harm the good name and trust of high school baseball." Because of this, they decided to leave the tournament.</p>
            <p>Koryo High School is a strong team in Koshien. They have won the Spring Koshien tournament three times. Their win in the first game will not be taken away. However, their second game against Tsuda Gakuen High School from Mie Prefecture will be counted as a loss without playing.</p>
            <p>Toshiko Abe, the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, said about the incident, "This is a very sad and unacceptable act." As for Koryo High School playing in the tournament, she said, "This was a proper decision made by the Japan Kohyoren, and I will not comment further on it."</p>
            <p>This incident caused a lot of strong reactions in Japanese society. Many people criticized the school for not handling the bullying problem well. They said that adults ignored real "justice" just to get into Koshien.</p>
            <p>Sports writer Shinya Kobayashi explained that strong baseball schools like Koryo High School mainly want to play in and win Koshien. Because of this, they often do not pay enough attention to helping victims. As for Kohyoren's decision that "it was not necessary to stop them from playing," Kohyoren usually accepts the school's investigation reports without question and rarely does its own investigation.</p>
            <p>Taichi Muneki, a city council member in Hiroshima, wrote on social media platform X, "Koryo High School pulling out has indeed made 'It's all SNS's fault' a popular topic." He said, "Blaming SNS and making the school look like the victim has been seen through."</p>
            <p>He criticized the idea that they were "forced to leave because of SNS." He said, "The real issue is that the school and the Japan Kohyoren did not understand the violence enough, which led to a bad and slow response at the beginning."</p>

            <h1>Nuclear Power Plant in Northern France Stops Working Because Jellyfish Block Cooling Pumps</h1>
            <p>EDF, a French electricity company, said that four reactors at the Gravelines nuclear power plant in northern France stopped working automatically. This happened because a large number of jellyfish blocked the pumps that cool the reactors. Because of this, the power plant had to stop operating today.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that, according to EDF's website, the nuclear reactors shut down on their own because jellyfish unexpectedly appeared in the filter drums of the cooling pump station. However, "the safety of the plant, its workers, and the surrounding area was not affected."</p>
            <p>EDF stated that three of the reactors stopped working automatically last night, and the other one stopped working early this morning. The nuclear power plant had to stop completely because its other two reactors were already offline for maintenance.</p>
            <p>EDF said, "The plant's team has started working and is doing the necessary checks and repairs. This is to make sure the power units can start working again safely."</p>

            <h1>New Taiwan Dollar Falls Slightly; 6 Major Life Insurers' July Profits Down 70% to NTD 18.3 Billion</h1>
            <p>The New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) got 10% stronger against the US dollar in the second quarter. This caused a big increase in losses for life insurance companies from currency exchange. This affected the profits of the six biggest life insurance companies in April and May. In June, the NTD's changes became much smaller due to the central bank's actions. In July, the NTD dropped slightly by 0.05%. All six major life insurance companies made a profit in July. Together, they earned NTD 18.329 billion. However, this profit was still 70% less than the same month last year.</p>
            <p>Among the six major life insurance companies, Taiwan Life and KGI Life announced on August 5th and 7th that they would use new rules from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) for setting aside money. Taiwan Life added NTD 15.128 billion and KGI Life added NTD 23.402 billion to their reserves for currency changes. Adding this to what Nanshan Life, Fubon Life, Cathay Life, and Shin Kong Life had announced before, all six major life insurance companies have now asked to use these reserves.</p>
            <p>Fubon Life made a net profit of NTD 5.93 billion in July after tax. Their total net profit for the first seven months was NTD 30.48 billion after tax, which is 57% less than last year. Fubon Life said that in July, their main earnings came from stock dividends in Taiwan, interest, profits from selling stocks and funds in Taiwan and other countries, and income from fund payouts. In the stock market, their Taiwan stock investments earned dividends and profits from sales. The US dollar has become more stable recently, so they will adjust their investments to protect against currency changes as needed.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life's net profit after tax in July was NTD 4.25 billion. Their total net profit after tax reached NTD 23.04 billion, which is 64% less than last year. Cathay Financial Holdings explained that both Taiwan and US stock markets went up. Cathay Life's profit improved because of better dividend income and stock market profits from sales compared to June. This helped their profit for the month.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life's reserve for currency changes dropped from NTD 56.4 billion at the end of June to NTD 35.4 billion at the end of July. Cathay Financial Holdings pointed out two main reasons for this. First, among the currencies they use to protect against risks, the Korean Won and Singapore Dollar lost more value than the New Taiwan Dollar. Second, even though the Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) rate dropped from over 8% in June to nearly 5% in July, the value change also dropped. This meant they used more reserves. Overall, they still have enough room to manage currency changes.</p>
            <p>KGI Life earned NTD 3.818 billion in July, helped by dividend income and profits from stock sales. Their total profit for the first seven months was NTD 4.889 billion, which is 72% less than last year. KGI Life stated that they started using the FSC's temporary rules for life insurance companies' reserves in July. All the released insurance reserves will be used to strengthen their reserve for currency changes.</p>
            <p>Taishin Financial Holdings and Shin Kong Financial Holdings officially merged to become "Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings" on July 24th. Taishin Financial Holdings announced that Shin Kong Life's profit in July was NTD 1.8 billion. This was mainly due to dividend income and stable profits from investments. However, this profit was only for the period from July 24th to 31st, which is just 8 days.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Life's net profit after tax in July was NTD 1.742 billion. Their total profit for the first seven months was NTD 8.958 billion, which is 54% less than last year. Taiwan Life explained that the main reason for increased losses from currency exchange was the US dollar's big drop of 8.7% this year. However, their insurance business continued to grow, and new policy premiums increased by 17% compared to the same time last year.</p>
            <p>Nanshan Life's profit after tax in July was NTD 0.79 billion. Their total reported profit for the first seven months was NTD 15.18 billion, which is 56% less than last year. Nanshan Life's new policy premiums in July totaled NTD 7 billion. Their main sales were investment-linked annuities, wealth management products, and high-protection products.</p>
