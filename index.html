            <h1>Man's Car Smells Strange, Police Find Many Drug Packs in Taichung</h1>
            <p>Taichung police were on patrol. They saw a car parked wrongly in Xitun District. They went to check the car. They noticed a strong smell, like drugs burning. They found 35 packs of drug coffee on the car floor. The police arrested the driver, a 35-year-old man named Lin.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Branch of Taichung City Police said that on the evening of July 31, police officers from He'an Police Station were patrolling. They saw a black car stopped in a red zone at the corner of Hankou Road Section 2 and Daxin Street in Xitun District. The car engine was still on. The driver looked nervous. Police thought something was wrong and went closer.</p>
            <p>The police car sounded its siren, but the driver did not move. When the police came close to the car window, the 35-year-old Mr. Lin quickly opened the door and got out. He told the police, "I was replying to messages, so I didn't see the parking sign." But he smelled strongly of something like burning drugs.</p>
            <p>Police looked inside the car. They saw many drug packs on the car's floor mat. They counted 35 packs of drug coffee. They arrested Mr. Lin right there. After questioning, he was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for drug offenses. Police are still looking for where the drugs came from.</p>

            <h1>World Children's Painting Exhibition Shows Local Life and Hopes for Peace</h1>
            <p>The 56th World Children's Painting Exhibition had its awards ceremony today. Many winning paintings show special things about local cultures. They show what children think about their daily lives and big problems in society. For example, a student from Taitung drew a picture about the harvest season. A student from Ukraine drew a picture showing hopes for peace.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Association for Children's Fine Arts Education organized this exhibition. The Taiwan Arts Education Institute helped. Countries like the USA, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand, a total of 41 countries, joined this year. Over 50,000 paintings from Taiwan and over 10,000 from other countries entered the competition. 88 special awards and 256 excellent awards were given to paintings from Taiwan. From other countries, 25 gold medals, 35 silver medals, and 60 bronze medals were given.</p>
            <p>Many winning paintings show local culture. They show children's experiences, social issues, and cultural features. For example, Su Xuan, a student from Jieda Elementary School in Jinfeng Township, Taitung County, won a special award for her painting "Harvest Season."</p>
            <p>Su Xuan explained that her painting has mountains, rivers, red quinoa, and peanuts. People can hunt in the mountains and catch fish in the rivers. Red quinoa and peanuts are food. She hopes her painting helps everyone feel the happiness of a good harvest.</p>
            <p>Lin You-chen, a student from Wenshan Elementary School in Nantun District, Taichung City, drew a painting called "Big Illegal Building Underground." She thought about how there might be more trains underground when she traveled by subway. She used rabbits as characters and showed social problems in a creative way.</p>
            <p>Paintings from other countries were also very different and interesting. For example, a student from Ukraine drew "My City." This painting shows that the child hopes for peaceful days to come, so children can learn and live happily again. A student from Belize drew "How Children Will Manage the Future World." This painting focuses on Mother Earth and shares love for the world and care for all people.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Arts Education Institute is showing the winning paintings now in its Third Exhibition Hall and Art Space. There will also be other exhibitions around Taiwan and special events. Experts will talk about the children's paintings with teachers, students, and parents in a fun way.</p>

            <h1>Lin Yi-fang Changes from Gangster to Comedian in New Drama; Bai Bing-bing Says: 'I Made Him Do It'</h1>
            <p>Actress Bai Bing-bing made a new TV drama called "Heaven Knows" and also acts in it. She invited her friends Lin Yi-fang and Ni Qi-min to be in the show. In this show, Lin Yi-fang plays a gangster leader. But he also has to be funny, which was a very difficult acting challenge for him. When they talked about filming, Bai Bing-bing laughed and said: "I made him do it."</p>
            <p>Bai Bing-bing's drama "Heaven Knows" is very popular now. Bai Bing-bing shared in a press release that she recently visited Zhulin Cixuan Temple in Tamsui to give thanks. She also thanked Cai Jin-xian, who is the head of the temple and a New Taipei City council member. He helped them find places to film. She said, "It was hard to find many filming spots, but he helped us get them."</p>
            <p>Bai Bing-bing said she asked Lin Yi-fang to act in this show. She wanted him to play a sneaky, mean, and strong gangster leader. Lin Yi-fang laughed and said this was the most challenging gangster role he had ever played. He said, "First, they wanted me to be fierce and tough, but then the producer Bai Bing-bing asked me to be funny." Bai Bing-bing then laughed and said, "I forced him to do it. I made him a comedian."</p>
