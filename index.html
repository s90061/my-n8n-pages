            <h1>Mexican Cargo Train Hits Double-Decker Bus: At Least 8 Dead, 45 Injured</h1>
            <p>Mexican officials reported that a cargo train hit a double-decker bus today. This happened in a town northwest of Mexico City, the capital. At least 8 people died, and 45 people were hurt.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press said this big accident took place in Atlacomulco, a town northwest of Mexico City.</p>
            <p>The civil defense agency of Mexico State shared on social media platform X that officials are still working at the accident site.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that the reason why the cargo train hit the double-decker bus is still not clear.</p>
            <p>A video shared on social media shows the double-decker bus slowly driving across train tracks. Then, a fast-moving train suddenly appeared and hit the bus in the middle.</p>
            <p>Another video shows the bus stopped next to the train tracks after the crash. Its roof was gone.</p>

            <h1>French Prime Minister Bayrou to Resign After Losing Confidence Vote in Parliament</h1>
            <p>In France, the Parliament held a vote today to decide if they trusted Prime Minister Bayrou's government. But Mr. Bayrou, who has only been in his job for nine months, did not win the vote. Now, President Macron will look for a new Prime Minister, and France is facing a new political problem.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that in the confidence vote in the National Assembly, 364 members said they did not trust the government. Only 194 members said they did trust it.</p>
            <p>The speaker of the National Assembly, Yael Braun-Pivet, said that according to Article 50 of the French Constitution, the Prime Minister must resign with all of his cabinet members.</p>
            <p>Someone close to Bayrou, who did not want to be named, told Agence France-Presse that Bayrou will tell President Emmanuel Macron tomorrow morning that he is resigning.</p>
            <p>The French President's office has already stated that Macron will name a new Prime Minister in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Bayrou is the sixth Prime Minister President Macron has had since he became president of France in 2017. He is also the first Prime Minister in modern French history to be removed from power by a confidence vote, not a no-confidence vote.</p>
            <p>Bayrou's government, which had fewer members, recently tried to get enough support for its budget plan to save money. He announced on August 25 that he would ask for a confidence vote in Parliament. This news surprised French politicians.</p>

            <h1>Trump Loses Appeal in Case of Defaming Female Writer, Must Pay Almost NT$2.6 Billion</h1>
            <p>A jury in Manhattan, New York, decided last year that former President Trump must pay a writer named E. Jean Carroll 83.3 million US dollars (about 2.56 billion New Taiwan Dollars) for saying bad things about her. Trump tried to appeal this decision, but today, an appeals court said the original decision was correct.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the jury found Trump acted with bad intentions when he spoke publicly about Carroll many times. In January last year, they decided Trump had to pay 65 million US dollars as punishment, 7.3 million US dollars to make up for damages, and 11 million US dollars for online activities to help Carroll's good name.</p>
            <p>When this civil court decision was announced in the federal court, people were surprised because the amount Trump had to pay was much more than the 10 million US dollars Carroll had asked for.</p>
            <p>At that time, Trump used his own social media platform, "Truth Social," to post many insulting messages. He attacked Carroll, the court process, and the judge.</p>
            <p>Today, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said: "We believe the federal district court did not make any mistakes in its decisions that were questioned. Also, because of the special and very bad facts of this case, the amount of money the jury decided Trump must pay is fair."</p>
            <p>Carroll, who is 81 years old, accused Trump of defaming her in 2019. That was when she first publicly said Trump had sexually assaulted her. But Trump said, "She's not my type," and that she made up the story to sell more copies of her memoir.</p>
            <p>In another civil case in 2023, a different jury in New York decided that Trump was responsible for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996 and for defaming her in 2022. At that time, Trump called her story "a complete fraud." The jury then decided Trump had to pay Carroll 5 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>The appeals court wrote in its decision today: "We agree with the federal district court that the jury had good reasons to believe that Trump would not stop defaming Carroll unless he faced a very large payment."</p>
            <p>Trump was not asked to be in court or give a statement, but he used this case to get media attention. He said he was being treated unfairly, and he used this to help his campaign to become president again.</p>
