Amazon is planning to provide free primary healthcare services to employees and their families in several U.S. cities. This new benefit aims to improve access to essential medical care and reduce healthcare costs for its workforce. The program, called "Amazon Care," will offer a range of services, including preventative care, vaccinations, and treatment for common illnesses.

Amazon is partnering with healthcare providers to establish physical clinics and virtual care options. This approach allows employees to choose the method of care that best suits their needs and preferences. The company believes that by offering accessible and affordable healthcare, it can improve the overall well-being of its employees and create a more productive work environment. The initial rollout will focus on cities with a significant Amazon presence, with plans to expand the program nationwide in the future.

**Article 2: Dutch Design Duo Creates Sustainable Furniture from Recycled Plastic**

Two Dutch designers are gaining recognition for their innovative approach to furniture design, creating stylish and functional pieces from recycled plastic waste. Using discarded materials such as plastic bottles and packaging, they transform them into unique and durable furniture items. Their work highlights the potential of sustainable design and the circular economy.

The designers employ a specialized process that involves shredding the plastic waste, melting it down, and then molding it into new shapes. This process not only reduces landfill waste but also creates furniture with a distinctive texture and appearance. Their collection includes chairs, tables, and lamps, all made entirely from recycled plastic. By showcasing the beauty and practicality of recycled materials, they hope to inspire other designers and consumers to embrace sustainable practices.

**Article 3: Iceland's Tourism Sector Adapts to Changing Travel Trends**

Iceland's tourism industry is adapting to evolving travel trends by focusing on sustainable and responsible tourism. Following a period of rapid growth, the country is now prioritizing the protection of its natural environment and cultural heritage. Initiatives are being implemented to manage visitor numbers, promote off-season travel, and encourage responsible behavior among tourists.

Efforts are underway to diversify tourism offerings beyond the popular attractions, showcasing the less-visited regions of Iceland. This includes promoting hiking trails, local cuisine experiences, and cultural events. By spreading visitors across the country and throughout the year, Iceland aims to reduce the environmental impact of tourism and provide a more authentic experience for travelers. The government is also investing in infrastructure improvements to support sustainable tourism, such as improved waste management systems and eco-friendly transportation options.
