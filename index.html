Berlin is experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 40 degrees Celsius this week. People are finding ways to stay cool, especially since most homes in Berlin do not have air conditioning. Lakes and pools are very popular, with many people going there to swim and relax.

Many Berliners go to lakes or outdoor swimming pools when it's hot. Some also stay home and close their curtains to keep their houses cool. There are over 3,000 lakes around Berlin, which are good places to escape the heat.

In Berlin, it is common to see people without clothes in parks and by lakes. This is part of a German tradition called "FreikÃ¶rperkultur" (FKK), which means "free body culture." This tradition started in the early 1900s and encourages being naked in nature for health and well-being.

As the weather gets hotter, more people are taking off their clothes at lakes and parks. This is due to the rising temperatures, the FKK tradition, and Berlin's relaxed party culture. However, experts warn that too much sun can cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer.

**Groups in Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, and Hualien Gather Outside Legislature for Recall Efforts; Cao Xingcheng Says "Big Recall is a Fight for Survival"**

Groups from Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, and Hualien held a rally outside the Legislative Yuan tonight. They are pushing for a recall vote, which is now less than three weeks away (July 26). Flags supporting the recall were flying, and people shouted "Big recall, big success!" despite the hot weather.

Cao Xingcheng, the former chairman of UMC, spoke at the event. He said that this recall is a very important moment, like fighting with your back against a wall. He warned that if the recall fails, there will be serious problems.

Other speakers also shared their reasons for supporting the recall. A retired teacher from Hualien, Ye Chun-lien, said she is worried because some lawmakers are passing laws without following proper rules, which she believes helps China's plans for Taiwan. She urged everyone to work together for the recall.

Another speaker compared the Legislative Yuan to an operating room, saying that some lawmakers are like bad surgeons. He said people should make them leave and that "big recall, big success" is the only choice.

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Shen Po-yang said that polls show more people, including those who usually support the KMT, are now willing to vote for the recall. He mentioned that if the recall fails, there could be many negative consequences, such as more Chinese people moving to Taiwan and financial problems. He believes voting for the recall is the right path for Taiwan.
