            <h1>Peng Jin-long: Promoting "Financial Grand Rebate" in 3 Stages, Hopes Companies Develop Unique Rebate Programs</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) shared an idea for a "Financial Grand Rebate Program" late last year. Today, Chairman Peng Jin-long explained that the plan will be carried out in three steps. First, when companies apply for new business, they should think about how they can give back to society. They should also create unique ways to give back. Second, companies will be asked to share their rebate plans on their documents or websites. Finally, the FSC will check and support good financial institutions with positive actions.</p>
            <p>The Economic Daily held a forum on financial rebates this afternoon. Peng Jin-long said today that the FSC first suggested the "Financial Grand Rebate Program" in December last year. The goal is for financial companies to use money from the public to do good things and earn trust. If people trust the financial system, the financial market can grow more. This was the main idea behind the program.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long pointed out that many research papers also support the idea of financial companies giving back. If financial institutions care about giving back to society and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, they will benefit in many ways. Taking good care of employees can also make companies more competitive, and international investors will want to invest in such companies. Giving back can mean raising salaries, improving benefits, and offering training for employees. It also includes giving back to customers, like making services better and offering good product deals.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long said that financial groups gave a lot of money during the recent storms in central and southern Taiwan. This is a clear example of financial companies giving back. He hopes that every financial institution can create its own special ways to give back, becoming more organized, complete, and forward-looking.</p>
            <p>The FSC plans to use encouragement, transparency, and support to carry out the "Financial Grand Rebate Program" in three stages.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long explained that first, financial institutions will slowly be guided to make giving back to society a main part of their business. At the start, they will be encouraged. When they apply for new business, they should think about how they will give back when they make profits. There are no limits on how or to whom they can give back. For example, in Kaohsiung's special asset zone, many trial businesses are allowed. Companies have stated in their applications how they will give back when their business makes money.</p>
            <p>Second, financial institutions will be encouraged to put their rebate plans in public documents or on their websites, like in sustainability reports. By doing this in an organized way, they can show their plans and activities for social responsibility. Companies can create their own unique financial rebate programs without comparing themselves to others.</p>
            <p>The third stage is evaluation. Peng Jin-long said that the FSC will give positive encouragement and support, through evaluations and special rules, to financial institutions that do very well. This is to help the industry and society work together on the "Financial Grand Rebate Program." The goal is to make financial companies more connected to society, creating new financial value that people can feel and share. This will make financial institutions more than just numbers and deals; they will be closer to people.</p>
            <p>Tong Zheng-zhang, head of the FSC's Banking Bureau, said that the main purpose of the financial industry is public service. A stable society is the basis for financial growth. He hopes financial institutions can build trust and make their brand stronger. He also offered four areas for diverse ways of giving back: improving financial education and knowledge, supporting local areas and disadvantaged groups, green finance and sustainable development, and being good corporate citizens.</p>

Joanne Tseng shared her recent life, saying she has been with her boyfriend for over seven years. She does not plan to get married right now. She believes being happy with her current life is more important.</p>
            <p>Joanne Tseng looked great today at the press conference for her brand, appearing with BL drama stars Zhang Zhe-wei and Chen Jun-ting. Joanne Tseng said she chose to work with them because her boyfriend suggested it. She joked that she and her boyfriend often tell each other about handsome men and beautiful women they know.</p>
            <p>Zhang Zhe-wei laughed and said he grew up watching Joanne Tseng's TV dramas at 8 PM, and he was a loyal viewer of "The fiercely independent women in the Family" and "Night Market Life." Chen Jun-ting said he was excited and hopeful to work with Joanne Tseng this time. He praised her as a very good senior in the acting world. They have also agreed to sing and dance together in the future.</p>
            <p>Joanne Tseng has been in a stable relationship with her boyfriend for over seven years. She does not plan to get married at the moment. She said, "Getting married is not the most important thing in my life, although it is still important. But at my age, being happy with life is the most important." Joanne Tseng also believes that love and marriage are good, but a woman's career must be separate from a man's. She often asks her boyfriend for advice about work.

            <p>Speaking about her skincare business, Joanne Tseng said that sales breaking 100 million are normal.

When asked if she would focus only on her side business, Joanne Tseng said, "I will not leave the entertainment industry. Every part is me. An artist can't truly leave the entertainment industry forever; they will still be looked at and talked about."</p>
            <p>In the future, Joanne Tseng will continue to have different roles. She still has plans for her acting career. She hopes to sing warm songs for everyone to comfort them.</p>

            <h1>Trump Raises Tariffs, Canadian Prime Minister: Over 85% of US-Canada Trade Remains Tariff-Free</h1>
            <p>After US President Donald Trump recently increased tariffs on some Canadian goods, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said today that more than 85% of trade between the US and Canada is still free of tariffs.</p>
            <p>Carney had said he was disappointed with Trump's decision last week to raise tariffs on certain Canadian imported goods from 25% to 35%. This change started on August 1st.</p>
            <p>However, Carney emphasized that it is very important that Trump decided to keep all goods that follow the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) free from tariffs. This agreement was signed during Trump's first term and he often praised it.</p>
            <p>Carney said in British Columbia, on Canada's west coast, that the average tariffs the US charges Canada are among the lowest compared to other countries.</p>
            <p>He stated, "More than 85% of US-Canada trade continues to be tariff-free in both directions."</p>
            <p>When Trump explained why he raised tariffs on Canadian goods, he said that Canada has not done enough to stop fentanyl from entering the US. Fentanyl has made the opioid drug crisis in the US much worse.</p>
            <p>Carney pointed out that the amount of fentanyl coming into the US from Canada is "almost nothing" when compared to other sources.</p>
            <p>According to US data, between 2022 and 2024, fentanyl found at the US-Canada border was less than 0.1% of all fentanyl found.</p>
            <p>Carney told the media that he has not spoken with Trump since the tariff announcement last week.</p>
            <p>He said, "We will talk when the time is right." He also expressed hope that negotiators from both sides can still work towards a complete agreement between the two countries.</p>
