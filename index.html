            <h1>UK and US Work Together to Fight Big Online Scams, Chinese Crime Boss Punished</h1>
            <p>London, October 14 â€“ The UK and the US are working together to fight online scams across different countries. Today, they announced punishments against a large scam network based in Southeast Asia. A total of 12 companies and people are on the list. All of them are connected to the crime boss, Chen Zhi, who was born in Fujian, China.</p>
            <p>The money and property of these people and companies will be frozen. This includes 19 expensive properties in London. The US government said that Chen Zhi's crime group is one of the biggest in Asia.</p>
            <p>The British government plans to release a new plan to fight scams later this year. Next year, they will hold a "Countering Illegal Money Summit" in London.</p>
            <p>London is a big center for international money. Also, places like the Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands, which are British territories, have often been used to hide money. Because of this, people are watching closely to see if the UK will do more to fight "dirty money" (illegal money).</p>
            <p>The UK Foreign Office said that the scam networks in Southeast Asia not only steal money but also force people from different countries to do scams. They do this by human trafficking, threatening, and hurting people, taking away their human rights. British people have also been victims of these scams.</p>
            <p>According to British government information, the crime boss Chen Zhi, who was punished today, was born in 1987. He has citizenship from Vanuatu, Cambodia, and Cyprus. He owns companies like Prince Global Group and is a director at companies like Uni More Group. He is accused of doing scams and washing money in Cambodia through companies and platforms like Prince Global Group and Jin Bei Group.</p>
            <p>Chen Zhi and his group started companies in the British Virgin Islands. They also bought property in London. This includes a luxury house bought for 12 million British pounds (about 500 million New Taiwan Dollars) in 2019. In 2020, they bought a whole office building in London's financial district for 95 million British pounds. They also bought 17 apartments in good areas of London.</p>
            <p>Besides property in London, Chen Zhi's companies, Prince Global Group and Jin Bei Group, also own and run casinos and hotels in Cambodia and other places.</p>
            <p>Today, the British government put Prince Global Group and Jin Bei Group on the list for punishment. Another company, Golden Fortune Resorts World Company, was also punished.</p>
            <p>Even though Golden Fortune Resorts World Company has "Resorts World" in its name, it is actually a scam center outside Phnom Penh. It was built by a company under Prince Global Group, including Uni More Group. It was made to look like a "science and technology park." Uni More Group was also punished today.</p>
            <p>The cryptocurrency platform Byex Exchange, which is connected to Prince Global Group and Jin Bei Group, is also on the list for punishment. Another company on the list is Cambodian Heng Xin Real Estate, a property company in Cambodia. It is accused of helping to build and run the scam centers.</p>
            <p>Besides Chen Zhi, other people punished by the British government today include Chhay Guy and Dara Ing from Cambodia, and a man named Zhu. Also, Lei Bo from China, and a man named Qiu who was born in China and has passports from Hong Kong, Cambodia, and Cyprus.</p>
            <p>The British government estimates that about 3.44 million adults in England and Wales were victims of scams in the 12 months up to March this year.</p>
            <p>Today, the US government also announced punishments for people and companies connected to Chen Zhi. They have seized Bitcoin virtual currency worth up to 15 billion US dollars. This was illegal money made by Chen Zhi and his group, and used to wash money.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Justice said in a press release that Chen Zhi and his group used their "political influence in several countries" to hide their criminal activities. They also bribed officials. Chen Zhi started these cross-border scams and money laundering around 2015. Now, his activities have spread to more than 30 countries.</p>

            <h1>German Foreign Minister Says China and Russia Harm World Order, Actions in Taiwan Strait Threaten Asia-Pacific Safety</h1>
            <p>Berlin, October 14 â€“ German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul warned that China and Russia are trying to change the global order, which is based on international law. He specifically mentioned China's military actions in the Taiwan Strait and near Japan. He said these actions threaten the safety of the Indo-Pacific region. He also criticized Beijing for supporting Russia's attack on Ukraine, which weakens the world's system of rules.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Wadephul attended an event in Berlin for the 40th anniversary of the Japan-Germany Centre (JDZB). He talked with Shogo Akagawa, a special editor for Nikkei newspaper in Europe. They discussed topics like Germany-Japan relations, safety in the Indo-Pacific, and economic plans.</p>
            <p>Wadephul said that China has been increasing its military activities in the waters around Japan. It has also shown a strong attitude in the Taiwan Strait. These actions not only put Indo-Pacific safety at risk but also weaken the world order that relies on rules.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that China and Russia are working together to challenge international law. They are trying to create new international rules that benefit only them. He criticized China for saying it supports working together and many countries having a say in global matters. However, in reality, China allows North Korea to avoid UN punishments, ignores sea laws in the South China Sea, and supports Russia's attacks. This hides China's own desire to be powerful.</p>
            <p>"Russia is testing how strong NATO is and directly threatening Europe's safety," Wadephul stated. He said that Russia has often flown into the airspace of the EU and NATO. It has also spied on important German buildings and tried to spread false information to harm democracy and public talks. Russia is not only breaking peace in Europe but also affecting safety in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
            <p>He gave an example: North Korea gives soldiers and weapons to Russia, and China gives political and economic help. This allows Russia to continue its war. He added, "These connections across regions show that the safety of Europe and Asia are closely linked."</p>
            <p>As the Japan-Germany Centre in Berlin celebrates its 40th year, Wadephul asked Germany and Japan, as democratic countries, to play a more active role in keeping the international rule-based order. He said that both countries are on the east and west sides of where China and Russia have power. They must work more closely to deal with the political challenges from China and Russia.</p>
            <p>The Japan-Germany Centre was started in 1985 by the governments of Japan and Germany. Its goal is to encourage political, economic, cultural, and academic exchange between the two countries. It also promotes talks about public policies and social issues. The center is in Dahlem, Berlin. For many years, it has held forums, academic meetings, and youth exchange programs, acting as an important bridge for relations between Germany and Japan.</p>

            <h1>Looking at Old Photos: The Hsu Tzu-chiang Case, a 21-Year Legal Mistake</h1>
            <p>(CNA website) The Taiwanese TV show "Presumed Innocent" is based on one of the most debated cases of legal unfairness in Taiwan's history, the "Hsu Tzu-chiang case." The case started on September 1, 1995 (Republic of China Year 84). A rich businessman, Huang Chun-shu, was kidnapped and then immediately killed. However, the criminals continued to call and ask for ransom money. The police arrested Huang Chun-chi when they tried to get the ransom.</p>
            <p>Huang Chun-chi told the police about two other people involved: Hsu Tzu-chiang and Chen Yi-lung. On October 22, when Chen Yi-lung was caught, he said the main planner was Huang Chun-chi's older brother, Huang Ming-chuan. But Huang Ming-chuan had already escaped to Thailand and was killed by enemies in December of that year.</p>
            <p>Hsu Tzu-chiang gave himself up to the police on June 24, 1996 (Republic of China Year 85), with his lawyer. He always said he was innocent. The whole case went through 21 years of court trials. Hsu Tzu-chiang was sentenced to death 9 times and life in prison 2 times. A total of 72 judges looked at his case. During this time, on July 23, 2004 (Republic of China Year 93), the Council of Grand Justices made Interpretation No. 582. It clearly stated that a person cannot be found guilty only because another person involved in the crime says so. This rule helps lower the risk of people being found guilty just because someone else makes a statement.</p>
            <p>On September 1, 2015 (Republic of China Year 104), in the ninth retrial, Hsu Tzu-chiang was found not guilty for the first time. The Supreme Court rejected the prosecutor's appeal on October 13, 2016 (Republic of China Year 105). The case was finally closed, and Hsu Tzu-chiang was allowed to live freely again. Hsu Tzu-chiang was held in prison for a total of 5,624 days. He finally received 28.12 million New Taiwan Dollars as payment for being wrongly imprisoned. This is the second highest amount in Taiwan's legal history for such a case, after the Chiang Kuo-ching case.</p>
