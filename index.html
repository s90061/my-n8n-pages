            <h1>Mazu's Only Starry Night Marathon: 600 Runners Start at Dongju Lighthouse</h1>
            <p>The "2025 Mazu Juguang Starry Night Marathon," the only night race in Mazu, started this evening on Dongju Island. More than 600 people finished the race under the stars and sea breeze. The organizers also offered a "all-you-can-eat" supply of seasonal mussels, which the runners really enjoyed.</p>
            <p>From 4 PM on the 13th, runners for the 7.5 km and 21.7 km groups started their race in front of the Dongju Lighthouse. They ran one or three laps around Dongju Island, enjoying the sunset and sea breeze, before reaching the finish line. The organizers also provided many special local foods. These included mussels, Dongju tofu, Roselle tea, and eel soaked in rice wine, allowing runners to fully experience Mazu's local flavors.</p>
            <p>To welcome the 600 runners from all over Taiwan and Mazu, the Yun-Tai Combat Skills Team from the Mazu Defense Command started the event before the race began in the afternoon. In the evening, the "runners' night" event also included the third quarter Yun-Tai exercise by the Mazu Defense Command for the first time. During the exercise, there were loud gunshots and bright lights over the sea. Cannons and bullets flew through the sky, making red and blue lines. People shouted, "I love our military," and this made the atmosphere very exciting.</p>
            <p>Chen Ming-chieh, the acting secretary-general of Lienchiang County Government, said that runners are welcome to come to Juguang to try the special race course. They can also enjoy Mazu's unique culture, art, and food. Chen Le-li, the head of Juguang Township, told CNA reporters that this year, registration was full in just four days, which was a new record. He hopes to continue the event next year and make it bigger to attract more runners.</p>
            <p>Here are the results of the "2025 Mazu Juguang Starry Night Marathon": In the 21.7 km challenge group, the first place for men was Lin Chih-chieh, second was Chu Chih-chin, and third was Lin Po-chao. For women, the first place was Liu Su-ya, second was Cheng Hsiu-ju, and third was Hsu Ling-yu. In the 7.5 km fun group, the first place for men was Chen Yung-cheng, second was Chen Ping-hung, and third was Huang Kun-chun. For women, the first place was Hsu Hsiang-lan, second was Chou Hsiu-chuan, and third was Chen Yu-chiao.</p>

            <h1>U18 World Cup: Taiwan Hopes to Hit Better on September 14th Against South Korea for Third Place</h1>
            <p>In the U18 Baseball World Cup, Taiwan lost to Japan today. This game did not affect their chance to move forward in the tournament. Tomorrow, Taiwan will play against South Korea for third place. Coach Liao Hung-yuan said that the team's hitting felt better today, and he hopes it will be even better tomorrow so they can win third place.</p>
            <p>It was decided yesterday that Taiwan will play South Korea for third place on September 14th in the U18 Baseball World Cup. Today, in the Super Round, Taiwan played Japan. The Taiwanese team hit 7 times, including a triple hit by Tsai Sheng-chieh.</p>
            <p>Coach Liao Hung-yuan said that the team's hitting felt a bit better against Japan today. He hopes they can play even better in the game for third place.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's starting pitcher today was Chang Yi-an. Lin Chun-hsi was the relief pitcher, and Pasulra Takisilnian was the closing pitcher. All three are good at both pitching and hitting. Chang Yi-an and Pasulra Takisilnian pitched for the first time in this competition today.</p>
            <p>Chang Yi-an's fastest pitch before this game was 144 kilometers per hour. Today, he pitched for 1.1 innings. He allowed 6 hits and 6 runs (4 earned runs). His fastest pitch was 139 kilometers per hour. Taiwan lost the game 1-9, and Chang Yi-an was recorded as the losing pitcher.</p>
            <p>Liao Hung-yuan said that Chang Yi-an had pitched in warm-up games, but today was his first time pitching in a real game. His speed was not as good, and he allowed more hits. However, the pitchers who came in later were able to control the game better.</p>
            <p>Lin Chun-hsi pitched for 2 innings in relief today. He allowed 1 hit, struck out 2 batters, and allowed no runs. His fastest pitch was 145 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Lin Chun-hsi said that when he faced the Japanese team, he felt no pressure and aimed for the strike zone, which was what he expected. He noted that their bats were very strong and hard to deal with. But he felt he did his job well and was happy for the chance to play in the World Cup.</p>

            <h1>Mooncake Packaging Problem Causes Mold; SunnyHills Stops Production and Offers Refunds</h1>
            <p>SunnyHills, a famous pastry brand, recently heard from customers that their mooncakes had mold. SunnyHills said that the problem was caused by a fault in the sealing of the packaging on a new production line. Because of this, they have decided to immediately stop making this year's mooncakes. They apologized to their customers and will allow people to cancel orders and get their money back.</p>
            <p>SunnyHills released a statement saying that some customers recently reported mold on mooncakes. The company started to investigate all possible reasons for the problem. After checking many times, they confirmed that the problem was a fault in the packaging seal from their new mooncake production line.</p>
            <p>SunnyHills explained that even though this was a rare problem, during the Mid-Autumn Festival delivery period, there wasn't enough time to find a perfect solution. Because they care about their customers, they decided to immediately stop making this year's mooncakes and also stop sending out all mooncakes.</p>
            <p>For mooncakes that have already been sent to customers, SunnyHills said they will give refunds to all customers who bought mooncakes. Customers can get a refund with their receipt. For orders that have not yet been sent, customers can cancel their order and get a refund, or they can choose to swap for other products if they agree.</p>
