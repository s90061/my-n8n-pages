            <h1>Hsieh Kuo-liang and Chiu Pei-lin Each Donate One Month's Salary to Help Hualien</h1>
            <p>Hualien's Guangfu Township was badly hit by the Matian Creek landslide dam overflow. Keelung City Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang and Deputy Mayor Chiu Pei-lin are each giving one month of their salary. The Keelung City Government is also joining with citizens to give NT$2 million through a special social welfare account. This money will help Hualien during this difficult time.</p>
            <p>Today, Hsieh Kuo-liang said in a press release that he hopes this act will encourage more companies, groups, and people to help. Everyone should work together to help Hualien rebuild. The Keelung City Government will keep looking for resources to give more help to Hualien. They also ask everyone in society to join in and support Hualien strongly.</p>
            <p>Also, yesterday, the Keelung City Government's Public Works Department and Environmental Protection Bureau sent 13 vehicles, machines, and 25 staff members to Hualien. They arrived around 11 PM. This morning, they received their tasks and started clearing about 400 meters of mud from Futian 1st Street.</p>

            <h1>International Medical Staff Report Severe Injuries in Gaza Civilians, Children's Burns Show Bone and Muscle</h1>
            <p>A new study shows that international medical workers who treated Palestinians in Gaza hospitals during the Israel-Hamas war say the injuries there are much worse than what civilians get in other modern conflicts. This study was published today.</p>
            <p>The study was in the important "British Medical Journal" (BMJ). Seventy-eight medical workers from Europe and North America answered a survey. They described how bad, where on the body, and what caused the injuries they saw in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>Omar El-Taji, a British surgeon and the main author of the study, told AFP that two-thirds of the medical workers had worked in other conflict areas before. Most of them said the injuries in Gaza were "the most severe they had ever seen."</p>
            <p>The study recorded over 23,700 cases of trauma and almost 7,000 wounds caused by weapons. These numbers are similar to what the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported.</p>
            <p>The study calls the injuries of Gaza residents "unusually serious." In Gaza, more than two-thirds of the weapon-related wounds were caused by explosions. This happened because of heavy bombing and shelling by the Israeli army.</p>
            <p>The study also says that this number is more than twice the number of civilians injured by explosions in other modern conflicts.</p>
            <p>The study states, "The number, spread, and military level of severity of injuries show that the pattern of harm in (Gaza Strip) is far worse than what has been recorded in past modern conflicts."</p>
            <p>El-Taji also mentioned that there was an unusually high number of third-degree or fourth-degree burns among the injured. These burns go deep through all layers of skin, under the skin, and even reach muscle and bone.</p>
            <p>El-Taji said he saw something shocking in Gaza last year. "Many injured children were brought in, and their burns were so bad you could actually see their muscles and bones."</p>
            <p>Also, poor nutrition and not enough water are the most common health problems in the Gaza Strip. Last month, a UN-backed group called the "Integrated Food Security Phase Classification" (IPC) officially said that some areas there are now facing famine.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Cultural Bureau Chief Charged for Helping Businesses and Overstating Ritual Costs</h1>
            <p>The head of Hualien County Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau and a section chief let the "General's Residence Park" open for business even though it had not passed safety checks. They are accused of helping a company illegally. They also falsely reported costs for religious ceremonies to help spirits and worship local gods. Today, the Hualien District Prosecutor's Office charged both of them with corruption.</p>
            <p>The Hualien District Prosecutor's Office received a report. It said that the "General's Residence 1936 Park," which the Cultural Affairs Bureau hired a company to run, did not meet some rules. But Bureau Chief Wu Jin-yi and Section Chief Tseng Chun-hsiang still allowed the company to operate for a trial period and then officially. They also reported false information for small purchases, like hiring Taoist priests for ceremonies and prayers. Wu Jin-yi is also accused of using a government car for personal trips.</p>
            <p>Prosecutor Hsiao Bai-lin of the Hualien District Prosecutor's Office led the investigation with the Northern Investigation Division of the Agency Against Corruption, Ministry of Justice. Today, the investigation finished, and charges were filed for corruption.</p>
            <p>Wu Jin-yi, who was kept in custody during the investigation, was moved to court this morning. The Hualien District Court has not yet made a decision by noon today. Tseng Chun-hsiang, who was released on bail earlier, told a CNA reporter by phone that he will let his lawyer and the court find out the truth.</p>
            <p>The Hualien District Prosecutor's Office said in a press release that Mr. Wu has been the Director of the Hualien County Cultural Affairs Bureau since September 15, 2020. Mr. Tseng has been the Section Chief of the Cultural Affairs Bureau's Administration and Cultural Facilities Section since December 7, 2021.</p>
            <p>In 2023, the two managed the project to let a company run the "Japanese Dormitory Group by Meilun Stream" (General's Residence Park). In May last year, the General's Residence Park had not yet received permission to operate under an updated plan. However, they allowed the park to make money by calling it "stress testing" or "trial operations." This illegally helped the company gain NT$632,300.</p>
            <p>The indictment also mentioned that after Mr. Wu became the Bureau Chief, he often said that construction projects for the Cultural Affairs Bureau needed traditional ceremonies. These included asking Taoist priests to inspect sites, holding ceremonies for spirits, worshipping local gods, and ceremonies for starting, building, and finishing projects. He is accused of falsely reporting higher costs for these ceremonies to pay back debts to temples. He is also involved in several cases of using government cars for personal use.</p>
