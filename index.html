            <h1>PLG Basketball Draft's Top Pick, Yeh Wei-chieh, Aims for Rookie of the Year and Hopes to Play Against Lin Chih-chieh</h1>
            <p>Yeh Wei-chieh was the first player chosen in the Taiwan PLG basketball league draft. He was a talented player who had studied in America. Today, at the team's opening event, everyone was looking at him. He wore diamond earrings and said his goal is to become the "Rookie of the Year." He also looks forward to playing against Lin Chih-chieh, who is playing his last season.</p>
            <p>Yeh Wei-chieh went to Nanshan High School. There, he won a dunking contest in the HBL basketball league. People called him the "Nanshan Flyer." After high school, he went to Alabama A&M University in the US. This year, in the Jones Cup basketball tournament, he played for the Taiwan White team. He made many exciting dunks there too.</p>
            <p>Today, he spoke to the media. He said the team is still getting to know each other, but the team spirit is good. Everyone lives in the dorms and talks about basketball after practice. He often talks to Chang Chen-ya, who also went to Nanshan High School, to ask about things to know in professional basketball.</p>
            <p>Yeh Wei-chieh said that he will stay calm for the new season. His main goals are to improve his scoring and shoot more accurately. He explained that he has been a good shooter from outside the basket since he was young. He believes that every new player wants to be the Rookie of the Year.</p>
            <p>As a new player on a new team, Yeh Wei-chieh feels positive. He said, "Even though I am the youngest, I can grow a lot on a new team. I think it's most important to show a good attitude during games, no matter how the team performs."</p>
            <p>Yeh Wei-chieh then smiled and said, "I am very lucky. In my first year as a professional, I can still play against Lin Chih-chieh. I grew up watching him play. I am excited to play against him in the new season and to see his last game at the Taipei Arena."</p>

            <h1>Chef Who Cooked for George W. Bush Deported After Overstaying US Tourist Visa for Many Years</h1>
            <p>News from Waco, Texas: The US immigration agency (ICE) sent a chef back to his home country. This chef used to cook for events related to former President George W. Bush when he was in office. The chef came to the US with a tourist visa but stayed for many years after it expired. He had lived in the US for 36 years, where he got married and had children.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, when President Trump returned to the White House, he quickly started a plan to deport many immigrants who did not have legal papers. This was an important promise he made during his 2024 election campaign. He said that these deportations would focus on people who had committed crimes. But news reports show that some people who were sent back had only committed small offenses, old violations, or no crimes at all.</p>
            <p>This case is about a chef named Sergio Garcia Silva from Waco, Texas. He had lived in the US since 1989. His case shows worries about the deportation policy and has caused many discussions in the local community.</p>
            <p>According to "The Waco Bridge," Garcia came to the US at 29 with a tourist visa. He did not plan to stay long. But he soon started working in Texas restaurants, made friends, and met Sandra, who later became his wife. Because of this, he stayed longer than his visa allowed. At that time, he sold ceviche in foam cups at a local football field. In 1995, he opened his own restaurant.</p>
            <p>President George W. Bush liked Garcia's cooking. Garcia provided food for reporters who covered Bush during his two terms as president. Reporters from the White House often ate at his restaurant. Because of this, he started to cater for events related to the White House.</p>
            <p>President Bush and the First Lady, Laura Bush, even took happy photos with Garcia. In one photo, they signed it with "Best wishes."</p>
            <p>Garcia's food truck was popular for a long time in Waco.</p>
            <p>Garcia and his family lived in the US for 36 years. He never had any criminal record, except for an old order to be deported from decades ago. "The Waco Bridge" reported that in March this year, special agents from the US immigration agency arrested him at his food truck. Just one day later, he was sent back to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.</p>
            <p>However, in April this year, he walked back into the US. He was then immediately deported again.</p>
