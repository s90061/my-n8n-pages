            <h1>Macron says 26 countries will give security help to Ukraine after the war; Italy will not send soldiers.</h1>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron said today that 26 countries have promised to help Ukraine with its safety after the war. This help includes creating an international team of soldiers for land, sea, and air. Italy, however, said again that it will not send its soldiers to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that President Macron also said he talked to US President Donald Trump after meeting with many European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The US help for security is expected to be decided in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Today's meeting brought together leaders from 35 countries who want to help Ukraine. The goal was to finalize security promises for Ukraine and get President Trump's support. European countries clearly said that Trump's approval is very important for these security promises to work.</p>
            <p>President Macron said at a press conference at the Elysee Palace in France: "The security promises will start when the conflict ends."</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy, who was there, said: "We know what is needed for real security. We already have a basic plan."</p>
            <p>President Macron first said that these 26 countries would send their soldiers inside Ukraine. But then he said that some countries would give help from outside Ukraine. For example, they would help train and give equipment to Ukrainian soldiers.</p>
            <p>President Macron did not say how many soldiers would be part of the security help.</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy also said that 26 countries want to join. They are now preparing documents with each country to explain what kind of help they will give. He was not ready to say how many soldiers might take part in patrols on land, at sea, or in the air.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Italian Prime Minister's office said Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke with other leaders online today. She repeated that Italy will not send soldiers to Ukraine. But she added that Italy can help check on any peace agreement if one is made.</p>
            <p>The war where Russia fully attacked Ukraine in 2022 is still going on. These security promises are meant to make Ukraine feel safe and stop Russia from attacking Ukraine again after the war. European officials admitted that peace seems far away now, but they hope to be ready when the war finally ends.</p>

            <p>Today, the US stock market started slowly but then went up. This happened because people think that fewer new jobs will make the central bank lower interest rates. The S&P 500 index reached a new high when the market closed.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 350.06 points, which is 0.77%. It closed at 45621.29 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index went up by 53.82 points, which is 0.83%. It closed at 6502.08 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology companies, went up by 209.97 points, which is 0.98%. It closed at 21707.70 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 75.04 points, which is 1.34%. It closed at 5667.86 points.</p>

            <h1>Oil prices drop by about 1% as US oil supplies grow and OPEC+ thinks about making more oil.</h1>
            <p>Today, global oil prices went down by about 1%, reaching their lowest point in two weeks. This happened because the amount of crude oil in the US went up unexpectedly last week. Also, people think that OPEC+, a group of oil-producing countries and their friends, might decide to produce more oil at their meeting this weekend.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures dropped by 65 cents, or 1.0%. They closed at $66.95 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil dropped by 49 cents, or 0.8%. It closed at $63.48 per barrel.</p>
