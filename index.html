            <h1>Shanghai and Taiwan Agricultural Seminar: Chairman Hopes for More Exchange</h1>
            <p>To help farming exchange between Taiwan and Shanghai, a meeting for young people from Shanghai and Taiwan about farming was held today in Shanghai's Chongming Island. Mr. Xiao Hanjun, the head of the National Farmers' Association, was there. He said that both sides help each other in farming. He hopes that in the future, people and skills can be exchanged even more.</p>
            <p>The event was called "Growing New Fields Together, Making Youth Dreams Come True." It was planned by a group from the Shanghai Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises. It happened today in Chongming, Shanghai. Around 150 farming experts and business owners from both sides came.</p>
            <p>During the event, people from Taiwan visited different farming places in Chongming. They saw orchid farms, a farming innovation center, a special farm called Taihe Good Seasons, and an eco-park. They learned about how farming is growing in Chongming.</p>
            <p>Also, three agreements were signed at the event. These agreements are about working together in farming and countryside areas. There was also a ceremony to open a new farming center for Shanghai and Taiwan's innovation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Xiao Hanjun spoke at the event. He said he hopes both sides can have more good discussions about farming. He was surprised that a big city area like Shanghai still has farming. He praised Chongming Island for its good natural environment. He said it has a special advantage, like a garden for Shanghai, where people can come on holidays to enjoy farm life.</p>
            <p>Later, Mr. Xiao told reporters that mainland China is an important place for Taiwan to sell its farm products. The amount of farm products sold to China is about the same as to the United States. However, the United States now adds a 20% tax on products from Taiwan. In comparison, most Taiwanese farm products sold to China have no tax because of the ECFA agreement. This is better for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He said that farming in mainland China and Taiwan works well together. He thinks people and farming skills should be shared more. He will continue to help this exchange happen.</p>
            <p>Many Taiwanese farm business owners also came to look at the market in China. Mr. Zhang Yuyong from the Butterfly Orchid part of the Chiayi Dalin Township Wenxin Orchid group said they plan to invest in other countries. They are still deciding where, but they have looked at Vietnam and are also thinking about China. Right now, they believe China has good sales opportunities and lower production costs.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Shihong, who manages the Yilan Dongshan Township Farmers' Association, said he mainly wanted to visit Chongming Island to see different farming methods in different places and natural settings. He said, "They can grow many kinds of plants and have ecosystems that we cannot." He thinks Taiwan might be able to learn from them. </p>

            <h1>Diabolo Theatre in Matsu: Over 1500 People Enjoy the Show</h1>
            <p>The last show of the Ministry of Culture's "Cultural Equality Tour - Village Theater One-Day Event" was in Lienchiang County, also known as Matsu. The Diabolo Theatre, which once showed Taiwan's culture at the Osaka Expo, performed tonight. More than 1500 people came to watch. They saw a special show that mixed diabolo tricks with modern technology.</p>
            <p>A very big stage was built in Banmawang Park in Nangan Township. Even during practice, local people came to watch and talk about it. People came from all the different islands in the county to see the show. Some even traveled from Dongyin Township, which takes 2 hours by boat. To make it easier for people to see the show, the Lienchiang County Government added extra boat trips between Nangan and Beigan tonight.</p>
            <p>Before the show started, Ms. Li Jinghui, the Deputy Minister of Culture, and Mr. Wang Zhongming, the head of Lienchiang County, began the event. They held glowing balls, which meant the show was starting.</p>
            <p>During the Diabolo Theatre's show, people watched carefully and clapped for the amazing performers. When the performers came off the stage to talk to the audience, many people excitedly shouted, "Pick me, pick me!" The atmosphere was very lively.</p>
            <p>A report from the Ministry of Culture said that the Diabolo Theatre uses traditional diabolo skills. They combine them with dance, music, new circus acts, and modern technology. They performed a moving show called "Light of Life." The stage had bright and beautiful changing lights. Diabolos flew between the stage and the audience, making pretty lines like shooting stars in the sky. It felt like everyone watching was in a world made of light with the performers.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry of Culture said that this year, they continued their idea of making culture fair for everyone. From July to September, they held three shows on three different faraway islands. The first show was by the Tang Mei-yun Taiwanese Opera Troupe. They performed a fun and magical musical play, "Meng Po Inn: Century Wedding - Starlight Edition," for the people of Penghu.</p>
            <p>After that, the Ming Hwa Yuan Arts and Culture Group performed outdoors in Kinmen after 10 years. They presented their big and exciting mystery play, "Cat God."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture said that the "Cultural Equality Tour - Village Theater One-Day Event" wants to help performing arts and ensure everyone can enjoy culture. Since 2023, this event has worked with local governments and performance groups. They have held 23 shows all over Taiwan and its islands. More than 350,000 people have come to watch. They hope that everyone who saw a show in their village had a wonderful and memorable time.</p>
