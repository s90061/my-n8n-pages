            <h1>Bloomberg: Microsoft says Chinese hackers used SharePoint weakness to get into systems</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg reported today that Microsoft says hackers supported by the Chinese government used a weakness in SharePoint software. They used this weakness to get into document systems of governments in many countries. People who know about computer security say that US federal and state governments were also affected. The Chinese embassy in the US said they are against cybercrime and against making accusations without proof.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Microsoft wrote in a blog post that Chinese government-backed hackers, called "Linen Typhoon" and "Violet Typhoon," used a flaw in SharePoint software. This software helps customers manage and share files on their own computers, not through Microsoft's cloud. The hackers used this flaw to get into customer systems.</p>
            <p>Also, a hacker group from China called Storm-2603 used the SharePoint weakness to get into the document systems of governments and businesses in different countries.</p>
            <p>Microsoft said they are still looking into other groups that might be using the SharePoint weakness to hack into customer systems. These attacks can change quickly. The hacker groups keep working together to attack.</p>
            <p>The Chinese embassy in the US said about the report that China strongly opposes any kind of cyberattack or crime. They also strongly oppose making accusations without clear proof. They hope that everyone will handle cyber incidents in a careful and professional way, with enough evidence, instead of just guessing and blaming.</p>
            <p>People who know about the issue, but who want to stay unknown, said that the hackers used the software weakness to get into government computer networks in Europe and the Middle East. They also got into systems for US education-related groups, the Florida tax office, and the Rhode Island state government.</p>
            <p>Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich who studies Chinese cyberattacks, said that looking at the targets, the computer methods used, and early evidence, these attacks are similar to past attacks supported by the Chinese government.</p>
            <p>A company called Eye Security helped 60 affected organizations. These included energy companies, consulting firms, and universities in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Oman, and the UAE. They removed hundreds of bad programs from servers.</p>
            <p>Adam Meyers, a senior vice president at the US security company CrowdStrike, said that hackers might have tried to attack two important targets on July 7th. His company is still looking into it. The early signs of the attack looked like a government-supported action. As the attack spread, it looked like it came from China.</p>
            <p>Microsoft said they have provided instructions on how to fix the weakness in the SharePoint document software. They will also keep helping customers whose systems were hacked and had bad code put into them.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg mentioned a report from another security company that wanted to stay anonymous. This report said that hackers also got into a US healthcare company and were planning to get into a university in Southeast Asia. Organizations in Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK, and the US were also targets that the hackers tried to get into.</p>

            <h1>Trump: Will visit China soon; Philippines leaning towards Beijing before was not good</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C. Special Correspondent Hou Ziying, July 22) US President Donald Trump said today that he might visit China "in the not too distant future." He said US-China relations are good, and China is attracting attention. Also, he said that before, the Philippines might have leaned a bit towards China, which was not good. But now, they are "back on our side," and he does not mind if the Philippines works with China.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump met with the visiting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House. They had a meeting and answered questions from reporters. Marcos Jr. is the first leader from Southeast Asia that Trump has met since he returned to the White House.</p>
            <p>When asked by reporters about when he plans to visit China and if he might meet Russian President Putin during his visit, Trump said, "We have many possible meetings." Chinese President Xi Jinping has invited him.</p>
            <p>Trump said he might visit China "in the not too distant future" and that "we will decide soon."</p>
            <p>Foreign media reported that the Kremlin said yesterday that if Putin and Trump are both in Beijing in September, they might meet.</p>
            <p>Also, when asked how the Philippines balances its relationships with the US and China, Marcos Jr. said that the Philippines' foreign policy is independent. There is no need to choose between the US and China. "Our main concern is to protect our land and use our rights as a country."</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. pointed out that to do these things, the Philippines needs to work with partners. "Our strongest partner has always been the United States." The Philippines also tries to build different groups and work with many countries that share similar ideas.</p>
            <p>Trump then added that he does not mind if the Philippines works with China. Marcos Jr. must do what is right for his country. He also said that the US and China also get along well. "We have a good relationship," and China is "attracting attention."</p>
            <p>Trump said that the Philippines might have leaned a bit towards China before, and he thought this was not good for the Philippines. After he took office, the situation has changed. "They are back on our side." But he also said that the Philippines can and should work with China.</p>
            <p>The Philippines says that according to the "United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea" (UNCLOS), it has the right to use resources in its 200-nautical-mile economic zone in the South China Sea. This area overlaps with China's claims in the South China Sea, which are based on a 10-dash line. The two countries have had many arguments in the disputed waters for a long time.</p>
            <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth met with Marcos Jr. at the Pentagon on July 21st. He promised to give more military help to stop China, including sending advanced missiles and drone systems.</p>
