Amazon has begun using drones to deliver packages to customers in College Station, Texas, marking a significant expansion of its drone delivery program. The service, called Prime Air, aims to deliver packages weighing up to five pounds in less than an hour. This initiative could dramatically change how people receive goods, especially in suburban and rural areas.

The drones are equipped with sophisticated sense-and-avoid technology to ensure safe operation. Before delivering a package, the drone flies to the customer's yard and lowers the package using a tether. Amazon hopes to eventually expand Prime Air to other cities and regions. Some challenges remain, including regulatory hurdles and concerns about noise and privacy.

Despite these challenges, many believe that drone delivery has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce. Amazon sees Prime Air as a key part of its long-term strategy to speed up delivery times and reduce costs. If successful, it could set a new standard for the industry.

**Title: Copenhagen Restaurant Noma Closes Its Doors, Citing Unsustainable Model**

Noma, widely considered one of the worldâ€™s best restaurants, has closed its doors in Copenhagen, Denmark, after 20 years. The restaurant, known for its innovative Nordic cuisine and foraging techniques, announced that its current model was no longer sustainable. The demanding work environment and the high cost of ingredients contributed to the decision.

Chef RenÃ© Redzepi, Noma's founder, explained that the intense pressure to maintain a top-tier restaurant was taking a toll on staff and resources. The restaurant was famous for sourcing unusual ingredients and creating complex dishes. This required a large and highly skilled team, which was expensive to maintain.

Noma plans to transform into a "food laboratory" focusing on innovation and developing new culinary ideas. While the restaurant is closing in its current form, the Noma team will continue to explore the future of food and hospitality. They aim to create a more sustainable and equitable working environment in the culinary world.

**Title: Italy's Cinque Terre Battles Overtourism with New Entrance Fee System**

The Cinque Terre, a picturesque coastal region in Italy, is implementing a new entrance fee system to combat overtourism. The region, known for its colorful villages and stunning hiking trails, has become increasingly popular with tourists in recent years. This has led to overcrowding and environmental damage.

The new system will require visitors to purchase a pass to access certain hiking trails and viewpoints. The price of the pass will vary depending on the time of year and the number of people visiting. Local authorities hope that the fees will discourage mass tourism and generate revenue to help maintain the area.

The Cinque Terre National Park is also implementing stricter rules regarding waste disposal and noise pollution. The goal is to protect the natural beauty of the area and ensure a more sustainable tourism model. Local businesses are also being encouraged to promote off-season travel to spread out the flow of visitors throughout the year.
