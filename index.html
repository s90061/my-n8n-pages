            <h1>Doctors Say Don't Forget Muscle Care After Disaster Cleanup Work</h1>
            <p>Southern Taiwan recently experienced strong winds and floods. Doctors have noticed that many people feel muscle pain or even get hurt while cleaning up after the disasters. They suggest that people rest or see a doctor when needed. Also, people should usually do muscle exercises and take care of their muscles to avoid losing too much muscle.</p>
            <p>Chi Mei Hospital held an event today in their clinic hall called "Exercise for Muscle Strength, Active Dads." They set up a place for people to ask questions. Professional trainers and nutritionists from the sports center gave personal advice. They also asked people to learn how to use elastic bands for muscle-strengthening exercises.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kuo Hsing-dao, who is a vice president at Chi Mei Hospital, said in his speech that because of the recent storms and floods, many people have been helping with rescue and cleanup work. Many volunteers and company workers have also been busy in the affected areas. During this hard work, some people got muscle pain, and many also got injured.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kuo said that fathers, especially, are often very important for their families. Many of them might not exercise or take care of their bodies regularly. So, when they suddenly have a lot more physical work to do, they can get very tired. He hopes that this event will make everyone pay more attention to keeping their muscles strong by exercising and eating well to be ready or to get better.</p>
            <p>Dr. Su Jiong-rui, a main doctor in the Rehabilitation Department at Chi Mei Hospital, explained that human muscles start to decrease after age 30. About 3% to 8% of muscle is lost every 10 years. After age 70, this loss can happen even faster. This is called "sarcopenia," or muscle loss. It not only makes people weaker but also affects how they move and their balance. It can also make them more likely to fall, break bones, and become unable to do things on their own. According to a survey by the National Health Agency, more than 34% of people over 65 have sarcopenia.</p>
            <p>Dr. Su stated that sarcopenia can be reversed and prevented. With the right exercise and enough food, people can get better. Research shows that older people who do muscle training at least twice a week and eat enough protein can keep their muscles and improve their ability to move. Doing resistance exercises with elastic bands is safe and easy to start, and it helps the main muscles in the body very well. It is a very good way to begin exercising.</p>
            <p>He said that some people have been working for many years and lifting heavy things, which caused injuries to their bodies. Because of this, they are afraid to exercise. But this makes their muscles weaker over time. Doctors can use ultrasound to find the injured parts and treat them. After the injured parts are healed, patients can go to the exercise center for muscle training. This helps them get better and slowly return to their normal lives. He asked people who have these problems to see a doctor early.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan People's Party's "Two-Year Rule" Discussed; Huang Shan-shan Supports Skilled Nominated Legislators</h1>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan, a legislator from the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), said today that Wang An-xiang, a person nominated for the party list, has been part of her office's work meetings. She said he might be new to public office but is definitely not new to the work. Instead, he is someone ready to help the parliament right away. People think Huang Shan-shan's words show that she supports the TPP's rule about party-list legislators serving for two years.</p>
            <p>The TPP will have a meeting for party members on August 10. There, they will discuss if the "two-year rule" for party-list legislators should be changed or kept. However, the TPP leader, Huang Kuo-chang, has said strongly that he will not change the system that the former TPP leader, Ko Wen-je, put in place. He emphasized that for the TPP, it's not just about the party growing, but more importantly, about keeping their promises and doing what they say they will do.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan shared on Facebook today that it was the birthday of the TPP and Ko Wen-je. Six years ago, on this same day, Ko Wen-je started the party with the ideas of being "reasonable, practical, and scientific," and he called on people to join him. He has been following these ideas all along. Ko Wen-je also said that we should believe that "the wisdom of many people will be greater than the wisdom of one person," and "one person walks fast, but a group of people walks far." Whether it was during the time in the Taipei City Government or now in the parliament, the TPP has always followed these beliefs.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan pointed out that the TPP's list of nominated legislators is made up of many different kinds of people. This includes people with backgrounds in medicine, nursing, labor relations, news media, politics, law, and experienced elected officials. These partners, from different areas, have been involved in policy discussions over the past year and more. This has allowed the TPP group in parliament to become the strongest team, working better than both the KMT and DPP parties, to oversee the government and protect what is good for the public.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan said that before they started their work on February 1 last year, the TPP group already had a good system. Wang An-xiang has been part of her office's weekly work and law meetings for more than a year. He is also in her office's work group, where he follows the daily news from the parliament and its procedures. He has also shared his ideas on many topics and changes to laws. She said that Wang An-xiang has worked hard to learn about the work of the Finance Committee to make sure he can smoothly do his future work in parliament and help local communities.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan stated that Wang An-xiang provided advice and solutions from the viewpoint of industries and workers during a recent public meeting in parliament about Taiwan-US tariffs. She said that Wang An-xiang might be new to public office, but he is definitely not new to the work and is someone who can help the parliament effectively right away.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Huang Shan-shan said that a judge asked her to be a witness for Ko Wen-je in March. Because of this, she could not attend court hearings for several months. She will go to court tomorrow afternoon to give her testimony for Ko Wen-je. She will tell the truth to help the court find out what truly happened.</p>
            <p>Huang Shan-shan thanked Huang Kuo-chang for bravely leading the TPP forward. She believes that difficult times will pass, and the truth will eventually be known. She said that Ko Wen-je's eight years as the mayor of Taipei were successful and should not be forgotten. She ended by saying, "A-Bei (Ko), we are all here, waiting for you to return."</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Tests Electric-Assist Dispatch Vehicles to Help YouBike Problem at NTU</h1>
            <p>Taipei City has started testing "electric-assist small dispatch vehicles" at National Taiwan University (NTU) today. This is to fix a problem at YouBike stations inside the university. Sometimes there are no bikes to rent, or no empty spots to return bikes. This happens at certain times, like ocean tides. The city hopes this new system will help.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Department of Transportation said that National Taiwan University is the only big university in Taipei that has YouBike stations inside its campus. And many people use them there. The university has 59 YouBike stations, and about 15,000 bikes are rented each day. This is about 6% of all YouBike rentals in Taipei.</p>
            <p>The Department explained that when students go to and leave classes, the YouBike stations on campus often run out of bikes to rent or places to return bikes. To solve this, the city worked with the university and Smile Cycling company (who runs YouBike). They created electric-assist small dispatch vehicles. These vehicles are more flexible than trucks and also good for the environment. They started testing them today.</p>
            <p>He You-ren, the general manager of Smile Cycling company, said that the NTU campus already has 4 trucks and 40 workers who move bikes around. But even with this, sometimes there are not enough bikes in the right places. So, to help the university, they specially made electric-assist dispatch vehicles that can carry 7 YouBikes at one time. They also hired more part-time workers. They hope this will meet the students' needs.</p>
            <p>He You-ren said that they plan to test the electric-assist dispatch vehicles for about six months. They are starting with 2 vehicles. During this time, they will watch how the vehicles work and make improvements. They will add more vehicles later if needed, depending on the situation.</p>
            <p>The director of the Taipei City Department of Transportation, Hsieh Ming-hung, said that the 2 electric-assist dispatch vehicles are expected to help move an extra 400 to 500 YouBikes each day. This will be much more effective than just using trucks. He hopes this will provide a more convenient service for students when the new school year begins.</p>
            <p>The National Taiwan University said that YouBike has become a very important "green" way for people all over Taiwan to travel. They thanked the city government for its help. They believe that the electric-assist dispatch vehicles, which are more flexible, safer, and better for the environment than trucks, will be a good solution for the YouBike "tidal problem" on campus. They also hope to continue working with the city government to make things even better.</p>
