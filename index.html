            <h1>People suggest high school classes start later; education group says curriculum needs to be checked.</h1>
            <p>Recently, some people have suggested that junior and senior high school classes should start later, at 10 AM. An education group said today that if only the start time changes and not the curriculum and other plans, starting later might mean less teaching time. If schools want to be shorter, they must also look at the curriculum and other related plans.</p>
            <p>A few days ago, some people posted a suggestion on a public online platform. They want junior and senior high school classes to start at 10 AM and finish at 4 PM. This is to help students get more sleep and improve their learning. The suggestion was made on September 9th, and by September 14th, it had enough support. Now, more than ten thousand people support it.</p>
            <p>Today, the National Education Alliance sent out a press release. They agreed with the idea of helping students sleep better and learn more. However, they said that similar ideas to start school later have come up many times before. If only the school hours change, and the curriculum and other plans stay the same, teachers might have less time to teach. They might give more homework to make up for lost class time. This could hurt how well students learn and would not help them learn more effectively.</p>
            <p>The National Education Alliance explained that if the number of credits and the way courses are set up do not change, there is almost no way to change the total teaching hours. Making school hours shorter would directly cause teachers to rush through lessons and feel more pressure.</p>
            <p>The National Education Alliance suggested finding out why students sleep late and how they travel to school. They also said schools could try different plans in some areas. For example, they could start later but keep the same total class time, or let students arrive at different times. If schools choose to be shorter, they must also look at the number of credits, how students are graded, and how many teachers are needed. They also need to plan for safe care at school and transportation, especially for families who need help.</p>
            <p>The National Federation of Teachers' Unions believes that students in Taiwan spend too much time studying. If class hours are made shorter, the curriculum must be changed, and problems with courses must be fixed. If the goal is for students to get enough sleep, starting school later or having shorter school days might not solve the problem. This is because students might still go to bed late.</p>

            <h1>China reviews a new law: Breaking national unity from outside China will lead to legal punishment.</h1>
            <p>Last week, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee met to discuss a new law called the "Ethnic Unity and Progress Promotion Law." According to the information released, if people outside China act to harm ethnic unity and progress, they will face legal punishment.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported that after the "July 5th riots" in Xinjiang in 2009, the Chinese government started to change its policies on ethnic groups. It began to focus on building a strong sense of a shared Chinese identity and making ethnic differences less important. The draft of the "Ethnic Unity and Progress Promotion Law" is the first time that "ethnic unity" has been included in the country's main plans for how to govern, using a special law. This draft has an introduction plus 7 chapters, with a total of 62 rules.</p>
            <p>The draft law says that no group or person can stop citizens from learning and using the national common language. It also says that no one can purposefully cause or make problems worse, or disturb public order, based on a person's ethnic group, customs, or religious beliefs.</p>
            <p>For "building a shared spiritual home," the draft law states that people should protect the image of the Chinese nation and respect its history. No one should insult, look down on, or show disrespect to it. The country will fully promote the national common language and help young children learn Mandarin.</p>
            <p>The draft law also says that the country supports Hong Kong and Macau in teaching about Chinese history, culture, and national conditions. This is to guide people in Hong Kong and Macau to willingly protect the country's power, safety, and growth.</p>
            <p>The draft law also states that the country will help economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan. It will also deepen integration in all areas between the two sides. This is to make people in Taiwan feel more connected to, identify with, and proud of the Chinese nation. It also aims to encourage people from both sides to promote Chinese culture together and to strengthen the idea that they are all part of the Chinese nation and are all Chinese.</p>
            <p>The draft law also sets out social conditions and requirements to help different ethnic groups interact and mix. This includes encouraging ethnic groups to live together peacefully and develop in a way that mixes their cultures.</p>
            <p>The draft law also says that if a group or person plans, carries out, or organizes violent terrorist acts, acts that aim to separate ethnic groups, or extreme religious activities, and these are considered crimes, they will be punished by law. If someone encourages or pays for these actions and it's a crime, they will also be punished by law.</p>
            <p>The draft law also stresses that if groups or people outside China take actions against the "People's Republic of China" that harm ethnic unity and progress or cause ethnic separation, they will face legal punishment.</p>

            <h1>African Swine Fever Appears in Yeoncheon, South Korea; Country's Warning Level Becomes "Serious"</h1>
            <p>South Korea's Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters for African Swine Fever (ASF) confirmed on September 14th that African Swine Fever was found at a pig farm in Yeoncheon County, Gyeonggi Province. Today, the country's crisis alert level was raised to "serious," which is the highest level.</p>
            <p>After the Headquarters confirmed the outbreak at the Yeoncheon County pig farm on the 14th, they followed the rules and killed the 847 pigs on that farm. They also sent a team to the area to control who could enter and leave and to do medical tests.</p>
            <p>Today, the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters met with other government departments to check the situation of the pig fever. After the meeting, they changed the national crisis alert level. This is the first confirmed case of pig fever in South Korea in two months, and it is the fifth case this year.</p>
            <p>To stop the disease from spreading, the government has ordered that workers and vehicles related to livestock in five nearby cities and counties, including Yeoncheon and Paju, cannot move around. This order will last until 8 PM local time on the 16th. At the same time, 33 large disinfection machines and vehicles have been sent to clean 294 pig farms and roads near the affected area.</p>
            <p>There are 61 livestock farms within 10 kilometers of the infected pig farm, and 22 farms that had contact with it. All of these 83 farms are now being checked very carefully and quickly. According to Yonhap News Agency, the government plans to do health checks on these 83 farms every week.</p>
            <p>The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters said that the 847 pigs killed are less than 0.01% of all pigs raised in the country. They believe this will not affect the supply of pork in the country.</p>
