            <h1>Oil Prices Go Up as Market Waits for Trump's Statement on Russia-Ukraine Situation</h1>
            <p>The White House said that U.S. President Trump was not happy when he heard that Russia attacked Ukraine at night with missiles and drones. He will make a statement about this later today. After this news, oil prices went up, after falling earlier.</p>
            <p>About two weeks ago, Trump met with Russian President Putin in Alaska, USA. But after this meeting, Russia and Ukraine have not made much progress on stopping the fighting. Last night, Russia attacked Ukraine again. Buildings were damaged, and at least 15 people died.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, said, "He (Trump) is not happy about this news, but he is not surprised. These two countries have been fighting for a long time." Leavitt also told the media that Trump will make another statement about this situation later today.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Brent crude oil futures went up by 57 cents, or 0.8%. They closed at $68.62 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures went up by 45 cents, or 0.7%. They closed at $64.60 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Japan and UK Defense Ministers Talk and Say Peace in Taiwan Strait is Very Important</h1>
            <p>Today, Japan's Defense Minister, Gen Nakatani, and the UK's Defense Secretary, John Healey, met at Japan's Ministry of Defense. They released a joint statement. In the statement, both ministers said again that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important. They believe this is vital for the world to be successful.</p>
            <p>The statement said that global security is becoming more difficult. Security and success in Europe, the Atlantic, and the Indo-Pacific areas are all connected. Both ministers highlighted the strong teamwork between Japan and the UK in military matters. They also confirmed again that they will make their global partnership stronger. To keep world peace and stability, they will make their defense stronger and work together more on security.</p>
            <p>The joint statement mentioned that Japan and the UK will keep and strengthen a free and open world order based on rules. They will also follow the United Nations Charter, which respects countries' independence and borders, and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Japan and the UK will continue to lead in these areas in the world.</p>
            <p>Regarding the situation in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, the defense ministers from both countries again shared their deep worries. They continue to strongly oppose any actions that try to change the current situation by force or threats.</p>
            <p>The joint statement said, "The defense ministers of Japan and the UK said again that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important for the world's success. At the same time, they strongly oppose trying to change the situation by force or threats." Both ministers also strongly criticized North Korea for making more nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</p>
            <p>The defense ministers from Japan and the UK said again, "Russian President Vladimir Putin's illegal, wrong, and unprovoked full invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of Europe, the Atlantic, and the Indo-Pacific. It also clearly breaks the United Nations Charter. Japan and the UK support Ukraine as it fights for freedom, independence, and its borders."</p>
            <p>Both defense ministers welcomed Japan's closer relationship with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) because of its support for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The defense ministers also welcomed the British carrier strike group coming to Japan this year for "Operation Highmast" in the Indo-Pacific. They praised the group's important role in keeping the area stable and following international rules. "Operation Highmast" is a joint training exercise with ships from the United States, Australia, Norway, and Spain. This also directly helps Japan and the UK work better together in the sea and air.</p>
            <p>Also, the defense ministers welcomed British F-35B stealth fighter jets landing on Japan's destroyer "Kaga" for the first time. They confirmed again how valuable it is for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and the British navy and air force to work together well in the future.</p>
            <p>The British aircraft carrier "HMS Prince of Wales" (hull number R09) docked at the U.S. Yokosuka base in Kanagawa, Japan, on August 12. Today, it moved to the Tokyo International Cruise Terminal in Tokyo Port. This is the first time a British aircraft carrier has docked in Tokyo Port since World War II. The aircraft carrier plans to leave Japan on September 2.</p>
            <p>After their meeting and joint press conference, the two defense ministers also went to Tokyo Port for a ceremony to welcome the HMS Prince of Wales to Tokyo Port.</p>
            <p>Japan's Defense Minister, Gen Nakatani, spoke at the ceremony. He said, "The visit of the HMS Prince of Wales shows that security in Europe and the Indo-Pacific is connected. This sends a big message for stability in the region, and it is very important."</p>
            <p>Captain William Blackett of the HMS Prince of Wales spoke to the media. He said, "The HMS Prince of Wales is the largest and most modern warship in the British Navy, and it has advanced technology." He also said, "The HMS Prince of Wales traveled a long way to dock in Japan, and the crew members are very happy. I hope the events held in Tokyo Port will help everyone understand how great the HMS Prince of Wales is."</p>
            <p>When asked by a CNA reporter if the HMS Prince of Wales had sailed through the Taiwan Strait, Captain Blackett did not give a clear answer. He only said, "As captain, I follow orders."</p>
            <p>In June this year, the British Royal Navy patrol ship "HMS Spey" sailed through the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan praised this action, while China strongly criticized it.</p>
