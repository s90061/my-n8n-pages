            <h1>Survey: British People Less Distrustful of China, But Still Worried About National Security</h1>
            <p>London, July 17 (CNA) â€“ A new survey about foreign policy was released today. It shows that British people trust China less than before. Last year, 71% of people did not trust China. This year, it is 62%. However, national security is still the biggest worry when dealing with China.</p>
            <p>The British Foreign Policy Group (BFPG) is a think tank. It is independent and not linked to any political party. Since 2019, it has published reports every year. These reports use surveys to understand how British people feel about world issues and the government's foreign policy. These reports are considered very useful. The latest report used a survey done in late May this year. It included 2,132 people from the UK.</p>
            <p>The report says that most British people do not believe China acts responsibly in the world. But the number of people who do not trust China is 9% lower this year (from 71% to 62%). BFPG thinks this change might be because people are less worried about COVID-19 now. Also, in recent months, important UK government officials have tried to make relations with China better. The report suggests that what the government has done might help people believe that the UK and China can have a more helpful relationship.</p>
            <p>However, for British people, safety concerns are still the most important thing when working with China. BFPG found that when asked about the most important things for the UK to focus on in its relationships with the US and the EU, British people clearly said "improving trade" was number one. This shows that most British people think about foreign policy by putting "trade first." But when it comes to China, British people believe that "keeping the country safe" is the top priority.</p>
            <p>The survey shows that 39% of British people think national security should be the first thing when working with China. Only 31% think "improving trade" should be first. And 19% think "working together on global problems," like climate change, should be first.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that older British people do not trust China as much. Younger people have a more positive view about working with China and letting Chinese tech companies grow in the UK (for example, TikTok).</p>
            <p>The survey shows that over 50% of British people aged 56 and above think national security should be the top priority when working with China. But only 22% of people aged 26 to 35 think the same way. For those aged 18 to 25, this number drops to only 17%.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, over 40% of British people aged 18 to 25 (49%) and 26 to 35 (45%) think that "improving trade" should be the most important thing when working with China.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that even though younger people are more likely to support different kinds of cooperation with China, their opinions are most different from older British people when it comes to Chinese technology companies.</p>
            <p>About 60% of British people aged 18 to 25 (61%) and 26 to 35 (59%) support Chinese tech companies working and growing in the UK. However, for people aged 36 to 45, this number drops to less than 45%. And as people get older, this number continues to fall a lot.</p>
            <p>In terms of national security, the report says that British people see three main challenges. These are: Russia's continuing attacks on other countries (44%), cyber attacks from other countries (42%), and illegal immigration (34%). It is important to note that only 17% of British people aged 18 to 25 agree that "supporting Ukraine" should be a top priority for the UK.</p>
            <p>Also, after Russia fully attacked Ukraine in 2022, the world's security situation changed. This made many European countries invest more in defense. The British government has also said many times that the UK and Europe are now in a "pre-war era." However, the survey shows that British people's awareness of danger and readiness for war are very different from what the government or military are saying.</p>
            <p>The report states that 71% of British people support spending more on defense. But most people do not want to cut money from healthcare, social care, or education, or pay more taxes, to pay for more defense spending. The survey shows that British people especially do not want to cut money from healthcare to fund defense; 60% of people surveyed are against this.</p>

            <h1>Guardians Win with Home Runs; Coach Chen Jin-Feng Says They Need to Improve Hitting with Runners in Scoring Position</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City, July 17 (CNA) â€“ Today, the Fubon Guardians baseball team beat the Uni-President Lions. But all their points came from home runs hit by Chang Yu-Cheng. After the game, the Guardiansâ€™ head coach, Chen Chin-Feng, said directly that the team is good at getting players on base. However, they need to get better at scoring runs when players are already on base.</p>
            <p>Today, Fubon Guardians won against Uni-President Lions 4-1 because Chang Yu-Cheng hit two home runs, each bringing in two runs. After the game, Guardians coach Chen Chin-Feng said that Chang Yu-Cheng played very well. "But actually, we could have done better in this game," Chen Chin-Feng said. He pointed out that their second batter, Tsai Chia-Yen, missed two chances to hit with runners in a good position to score. This part was not done well.</p>
            <p>Chen Chin-Feng mentioned that Tsai Chia-Yen has been practicing in the minor league for some time. "So he needs to understand how to do these things himself. In a game, there are not many chances to hit. There are not many good chances to score. How to take these chances, he needs to calm down. Sometimes you don't need a hit to score a run. He still needs to learn this."</p>
            <p>Chen Chin-Feng said that the team has no problem getting players on base. But when there are runners on base, their hitting against the pitcher is not very good. "If everyone is too eager to hit, they might lose their control. This is an area we need to improve. Sometimes they do very well, sometimes they are not very steady."</p>
            <p>Also, the Guardiansâ€™ starting pitcher, Shawn Morimando, threw 91 pitches in this game. He pitched for 6 innings, giving up 5 hits, 2 walks, and getting 3 strikeouts. He did not let the other team score any runs, which is a good quality start. He got his 5th win this season.</p>
            <p>Chen Chin-Feng said that Morimando's situation is similar to Roenis Elias. They can suddenly have problems. For some time, the pitching and catching coaches have been trying to find ways for the catcher to help the pitcher. "Now they (Morimando and Elias) are quite stable on the field by themselves. We are very thankful to the pitching and catching coaches for this."</p>

            <h1>Tainan City Investigator Accused of Corruption, Prosecutors Arrest Him</h1>
            <p>Tainan, July 17 (CNA) â€“ An investigator named Lin from the Tainan City Investigation Bureau is accused of sharing secrets and taking bribes. Yesterday, the Tainan District Prosecutors Office searched his office and home. They also called Mr. Lin in for questioning. After questioning today, they asked the court to hold him. The Tainan District Court decided tonight to keep him in custody and not allow him to see or talk to anyone.</p>
            <p>The Tainan District Court said tonight that Mr. Lin is suspected of several serious crimes. These include illegally gathering and using other people's private information, a public official revealing secret information not related to national defense, the crime of having unexplained money under the Anti-Corruption Act, and money laundering under the Money Laundering Control Act. The court believes he very likely committed these crimes.</p>
            <p>Also, the court decided that Mr. Lin did not tell the full truth and changed his story. Some people involved in the case have not yet been questioned. Also, some of Mr. Lin's phone messages from certain times were completely deleted. This means there is a risk that he might destroy evidence or talk to other people involved in the crime or witnesses. The court believes his actions are serious and have already caused harm to society. Because of this, the court decided to keep him in custody and not allow him to see or talk to anyone.</p>
