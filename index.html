            <h1>Hollywood Stars Bring Back a Free Speech Group from the Cold War Era, Worried About Trump Stopping Criticism</h1>
            <p>More than 550 famous people in Hollywood, like actress Jane Fonda, have started a free speech group again. This group was first formed during the Cold War. They say that the Trump government is trying to stop people from criticizing it.</p>
            <p>News agencies like AFP, CNN, and NPR reported that over 550 Hollywood stars have restarted the "Committee for the First Amendment." This group was first made during the "Red Scare" time in the Cold War.</p>
            <p>Famous actors such as Natalie Portman, Sean Penn, and Anne Hathaway have joined this new "Committee for the First Amendment."</p>
            <p>Black American director Spike Lee and Aaron Sorkin, who created the TV show "West Wing," are also part of it.</p>
            <p>They released a statement today. It said, "This committee began during the McCarthy era. That was a dark time when the government punished American citizens for their political beliefs. That problem is back again. Now we must stand together to protect our rights given by the Constitution."</p>
            <p>Eighty years ago, Jane Fonda's father, Henry Fonda, along with Lucille Ball, Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, and Judy Garland, started the first "Committee for the First Amendment." They fought against McCarthyism.</p>
            <p>In the early Cold War, Senator Joseph McCarthy from the U.S. led a movement against communism. He used unfair methods to find communists or people who supported communism in the country, including people in Hollywood and the entertainment industry.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Jane Fonda sent a letter to her colleagues in Hollywood. She asked them to join the restarted "Committee for the First Amendment."</p>
            <p>She wrote, "I am 87 years old. I have seen wars, unfair treatment, protests, and boycotts. People have praised me, and they have also called me an enemy of the country. But I can tell you: this is the most frightening time in my life."</p>

            <h1>U.S. Government Stops Working, Around 750,000 Workers Will Not Get Paid</h1>
            <p>The U.S. government shutdown continues. Today, the Senate said no to a plan that tried to fix the money problem between President Trump and Democrats in Congress. This means the try to quickly end the government shutdown failed. Around 750,000 government workers will now have to take unpaid time off.</p>
            <p>Because Trump and members of Congress could not agree on how to keep the government running, many federal offices and groups stopped working at 12:01 AM today. The government ran out of money.</p>
            <p>Democrats in the Senate want more money for healthcare for people with low incomes. So, they would not help the Republican Party, which has most of the votes, pass a bill already approved by the House of Representatives. This bill would have kept the government working for a few more weeks to allow more time for talks.</p>
            <p>About 750,000 government workers will likely have to take forced time off without pay. They will not get paid until they can return to work.</p>
            <p>Important workers, like those in the military and border control, might have to work without pay. Some might not even get their salaries next week.</p>
            <p>The House of Representatives, where Republicans have more power, passed a bill for short-term money. It aimed to keep the government working until late November, giving more time to make a long-term budget plan.</p>
            <p>But the Senate needs 60 votes to send the bill to Trump to sign. Democrats say they will not help pass it if Republicans do not agree to changes in budget cuts, especially for healthcare.</p>

            <h1>U.S. Government Buys Part of a Big North American Lithium Company to Rely Less on China</h1>
            <p>Today, Lithium Americas, a large company that mines lithium in North America, announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has bought a 5% share in the company. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said this is important to stop China from controlling too much of the lithium market.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Lithium Americas is based in Vancouver, Canada. The company is working on one of the biggest lithium mines in the world in northern Nevada, U.S.</p>
            <p>Reports say the U.S. Department of Energy now owns 5% of Lithium Americas. It also owns 5% of the Thacker Pass lithium mine project in Nevada, which belongs to the company.</p>
            <p>According to Bloomberg News and the Associated Press, this project has the largest amount of lithium in the U.S. It is a joint project between Lithium Americas and General Motors.</p>
            <p>The Thacker Pass lithium mine project is considered very important. It helps the U.S. to rely less on China for lithium. Lithium is a key material used to make high-tech batteries for cell phones, electric cars, and energy from natural sources.</p>
            <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that this agreement with Lithium Americas makes the supply chain inside the country stronger. It helps the U.S. depend less on other countries for important minerals.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, when Wright spoke to Bloomberg TV, he said this action is needed to balance China's strong position in the lithium market.</p>
