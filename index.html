            <h1>Sanae Takaichi Plans New Roles: Taro Aso Expected to Be LDP Vice President</h1>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi, the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), started to arrange new job roles today. In the evening, she talked with Taro Aso, a top advisor for the LDP, for about one hour. Aso supported Takaichi when she was chosen as the new leader. It is expected that Taro Aso will become the Vice President of the party. His brother-in-law, Shunichi Suzuki, is likely to become the Secretary-General. These decisions are expected to be confirmed as early as October 7.</p>
            <p>According to the Nikkei newspaper, Takaichi is planning to appoint Taro Aso as Vice President and Shunichi Suzuki, who is currently the chairman of the General Council and part of Aso's group, as Secretary-General. Aso was very important in helping Takaichi win the leadership election.</p>
            <p>Takaichi and Aso talked for about one hour in the evening. It is thought that they discussed who would get important jobs in the party. After the meeting, when reporters asked about the person chosen for Secretary-General, Takaichi only said, "The person has not been told yet."</p>
            <p>Shunichi Suzuki is 72 years old. He worked as the Minister of the Environment under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Later, he was the Deputy Foreign Minister and Minister for the Tokyo Olympics under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. His father, Zenko Suzuki, was a former Prime Minister of Japan. Taro Aso is married to Suzuki's third older sister.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Takaichi spoke at a press conference about the Secretary-General role. She said, "I hope this job will be given to someone who can communicate well with all political parties."</p>
            <p>Besides the top jobs in the party, Takaichi is also working to create a new government cabinet. Reports say that former Defense Minister Minoru Kihara might get an important job. Kihara was the campaign manager for Takaichi in the 2021 LDP leadership election, and they have a close relationship.</p>
            <p>Minoru Kihara is currently the Secretary-General of the Japan-Taiwan Parliamentary Group, so he has good relations with Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Takaichi also mentioned the four people who ran against her in the election yesterday: Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, former Minister in charge of Economic Security Takayuki Kobayashi, and former Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi. She said, "Everyone has great qualities, and I hope they can use their strengths." This means she plans to give them important roles in the government or the party.</p>
