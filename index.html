            <h1>Trump Says Ending Many Wars; Not Getting Nobel Prize Would Be an "Insult" to America</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump believes he has ended many wars. He said today that if he does not receive the Nobel Peace Prize for this, it would be an "insult" to America.</p>
            <p>Trump has long wanted this special award, which will be announced on October 10. After sharing a peace plan for the Gaza area yesterday, he again spoke about deserving the prize today.</p>
            <p>Speaking to hundreds of high-ranking U.S. military officers, Trump said, "Will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not. They give the award to someone who has done nothing."</p>
            <p>"I tell you, it would be a big insult to our country. I don't want to get it; I want our country to get this award."</p>
            <p>"Our country deserves the award because we have never achieved such things before."</p>
            <p>As a Republican, Trump has often felt upset that former Democratic President Barack Obama received the Peace Prize in 2009.</p>
            <p>In his speech today, he repeated that since he returned to the White House in January this year, he has solved seven wars.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that if his Gaza plan, announced yesterday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, works well, "then we will have solved eight wars in eight months. This is amazing."</p>
            <p>Hamas has not yet responded to this plan.</p>
            <p>However, in Oslo, Norway, where the Nobel Peace Prize winner is chosen, most people think Trump has almost no chance of winning this year.</p>
            <p>Oeivind Stenersen, a historian who studies the Nobel Peace Prize and wrote a book about it, told AFP, "This is completely impossible to imagine."</p>
            <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee also said that Trump's strong campaigning will not affect their decision.</p>
            <p>Kristian Berg Harpviken, the committee's secretary, recently told AFP in an interview, "Of course, we notice that some candidates get a lot of media attention, but this actually does not affect the discussions inside the committee."</p>
            <p>The Trump administration recently listed seven wars that he claims have ended peacefully. These include Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
            <p>However, even though Trump quickly took credit for some of these developments, like announcing a ceasefire between nuclear powers India and Pakistan in May this year, many of his statements are only partly true or not correct.</p>
