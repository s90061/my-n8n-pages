            <h1>People See Many Locusts in New Taipei, Agricultural Bureau Says It's Normal for the Season</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Reporter Chao Min-Ya, New Taipei, August 1) People have recently reported seeing locusts in many parts of New Taipei. Today, the New Taipei City Government Agricultural Bureau said that experts told them locusts grow fast in August due to high temperatures. So, it is common to see them now. This is a natural event for the season. If people are worried, they can use pesticides at home to control them.</p>
            <p>The Agricultural Bureau also sent a message. It said that a researcher from the Council of Agriculture's Taoyuan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station believes that the number of locusts will slowly go down when the weather gets cooler or it rains. People do not need to be scared.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, some people posted photos on Threads, a social media website. They said they often saw locusts in Zhonghe and Yonghe districts in New Taipei recently. Other people commented that they also had a "bug problem." They reported similar situations in Xinzhuang, Tucheng, Shulin, Banqiao, Sanchong, Xindian, and Taishan districts.</p>
            <p>The Agricultural Bureau said that the "Áï∞Ê≠ßËîóËùó" (a type of locust) is not currently listed as a farm pest by the central government. The Bureau checked with farmers' associations, and no farmers have reported damage to their crops. So, there is no need to report this to the Council of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.</p>

            <h1>Slovenia Is First EU Country to Stop All Weapon Trade with Israel</h1>
            <p>(Ljubljana, Central News Agency, August 1, reported by foreign press) The government of Slovenia has announced that it will completely stop trading weapons with Israel. This is because of the war in the Gaza Strip. Slovenia says it is the first country in the European Union (EU) to do this.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Slovenian government released a statement late last night. It said: "Slovenia is the first European country to stop importing, exporting, and moving weapons to Israel."</p>
            <p>The statement also said that Slovenia acted "alone." This is because the EU "cannot take strong actions... due to disagreements and a lack of unity inside."</p>
            <p>The Slovenian government's statement also mentioned that in the terrible Gaza war, "people are dying... because they are not getting enough help with food and medicine." It added that "taking action is the duty of every responsible country, even if it means going ahead of other countries."</p>
