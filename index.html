            <h1>Russia-Ukraine-US Meeting Uncertain; Putin Says Conditions Not Ready for Talks with Zelensky</h1>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine is showing small signs of slowing down. Recently, the US and Russia have shown they might want to start peace talks. Reports say that US President Trump plans to hold a meeting with Russian President Putin. After that, he wants to have a three-way meeting that would include Ukrainian President Zelensky. However, both Russia and the US have given different ideas about this, so the future of a three-way meeting is not clear.</p>
            <p>Tonight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke and said that Ukraine has the right to be part of any agreement that affects it. He said that for a fair solution, a meeting with the leaders of all three sides is needed. He thanked Trump for wanting peace, but he also said that "every step must be thought about carefully."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said that Russia's war against Ukraine is a threat to freedom in all of Europe. Because of this, Europe should have a place at any talks. He stated that Ukraine is working to set up meetings to make sure Europe's interests are protected.</p>
            <p>"The war by Russia is against Ukraine, it is a challenge to our freedom, and it is an attack on the freedom of all Europe," Zelenskyy stressed.</p>
            <p>According to Russia's TASS news agency, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is open to meeting with Zelenskyy. But, he said it must happen under the right conditions. "I repeat that I am not against the whole meeting; it is possible," Putin told reporters. "But it needs to meet certain conditions. Sadly, there is still a long way to go to create these conditions."</p>
            <p>Regarding a two-way meeting with Donald Trump, Putin said he suggested holding it in the United Arab Emirates. He also said that Russia and the US have wanted this meeting for a long time.</p>
            <p>Yury Ushakov, a foreign policy advisor to the Kremlin, said that Russia and the US have agreed on a place for the talks. The time is set for next week, and they are now finalizing the details. It is expected to be announced later.</p>
            <p>According to the New York Post, officials from the White House said that Trump's plan for a US-Russia meeting depends on Putin meeting with Zelenskyy first. However, Putin has often refused to talk directly with Zelenskyy in the past. This makes the US-Russia meeting uncertain.</p>
            <p>Ushakov told reporters in Moscow that Russia is now focused on preparing for the two-way meeting with Trump. About the idea of a three-way meeting, he said it was just a suggestion from the US when they visited Russia. Russia has not given a clear answer about it yet.</p>
            <p>Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's former culture minister, led the Russian team in the third round of Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, Turkey. He said that both sides had big differences on ceasefire conditions, so there was no room for a leaders' meeting yet. He used the talks between Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek during the Chinese Civil War as an example. He explained that if there is no agreement, a meeting between leaders will not be truly useful.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported yesterday that Trump recently spoke with European leaders. He said that he would meet with Putin as early as next week. After that, he plans to invite Zelenskyy to join a three-way meeting. But Trump clearly stated that only he and the leaders of Russia and Ukraine would be part of the talks. Representatives from other European countries would not be included.</p>

            <h1>Leaders of Brazil and India Promise to Protect Global Cooperation After Trump's 50% Tariffs</h1>
            <p>After US President Trump put high taxes on goods coming from Brazil and India, Brazilian President Lula and Indian Prime Minister Modi spoke on the phone today. Both leaders promised to "defend multilateralism." Multilateralism means many countries working together.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, the office of the Brazilian President said that both leaders agreed it is important to "defend multilateralism and deal with the economic problems caused by Trump's tariff war."</p>
            <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X (a social media platform) that he wants to make the relationship with Brazil stronger. Brazil is a member of BRICS, a group of important developing countries. He added that "strong partnerships among countries in the Global South, focused on people, are good for everyone."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Donald Trump announced that he would double the tax on goods from India coming into the US to 50%. This is because India buys oil from Russia. Oil is a very important source of money for Russia during its war with Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The first 25% tax on Indian goods started today. The added 25% tax will start in three weeks.</p>
            <p>Trump also put special taxes on Brazil. This is because the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva put Trump's friend, former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, on trial for planning a coup.</p>
            <p>Many products from Brazil, including coffee, have had a 50% tax put on them since yesterday when they enter the US.</p>
