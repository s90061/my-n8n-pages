Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp., is looking to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) on what could be his largest investment yet: a trillion-dollar industrial area in Arizona for building robots and artificial intelligence. SoftBank wants TSMC, which makes advanced AI chips for Nvidia Corp., to play a major role, although TSMC already plans to invest $165 billion in the U.S. and has begun production at its first Arizona factory. Son has listed SoftBank Vision Fund companies that might join the Arizona project, as he aims to boost SoftBank's stock and repay long-term investors.

**US Added Over 1,000 Millionaires a Day Last Year**

According to a UBS report released on Wednesday, the United States gained more than 379,000 new U.S. dollar millionaires last year, which is over 1,000 per day. This was more than any other global market. Together, North America and the U.S. hold over half of the personal wealth in the 56 markets studied. UBS noted that in 2024, wealth growth was strongly focused on North America, mainly because of a stable U.S. dollar and positive financial markets. While the U.S. saw the most new millionaires, Switzerland and Luxembourg had the highest percentage of U.S.-dollar millionaires per person, with more than one in seven adults being a millionaire.

**Oil Tankers Near Iran Appear to Be in Rural Russia Due to Signal Jamming**

On Sunday, an oil tanker named Front Tyne was sailing through the Gulf between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. However, around 9:40 a.m., ship-tracking data strangely showed the large vessel located in Russia, specifically in farming areas known for growing barley and sugar beets. Later that day, by 4:15 p.m., the ship's irregular signals indicated it was near Bidkhun in southern Iran, before continuing to show it moving back and forth across the Gulf. This problem, known as GPS spoofing or jamming, is increasingly worrying in sea navigation, especially in geopolitically sensitive areas. It can make ships appear far from their actual position, raising concerns about safety and possible illegal activities. Authorities and experts are investigating these incidents to understand their impact on global shipping and security.
