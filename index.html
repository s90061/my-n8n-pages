Aishanlin Construction and Development's chairman, Zhu Wen-yu, announced that after 10 years of effort, the company's revenue reached over NT$10 billion in 2024. As they build more of their own projects, Aishanlin will change its main business. Starting next year, construction will be the main source of income, and sales agency will be secondary. The income split will change from 30% construction and 70% sales to 80% construction and 20% sales.

During a shareholders' meeting, Zhu explained that they have been taking on fewer sales agency projects and increasing their own construction projects. This is because they can control the prices of their own projects and offer discounts more easily. He said that when the economy is good, they can do more sales for other companies, but starting this year, their own projects are more numerous. In the future, they will focus on their main construction business.

Looking ahead to the second half of the year, Zhu thinks that if the central bank does not add more rules for the housing market, prices in popular areas where there are more homes than buyers might slowly go up.

He believes that the central bank's seventh set of housing rules last September mainly affected investors and rich people buying second or third homes, not first-time buyers. Most of Aishanlin's current projects are for people who need a home, so they are not affected much.

Regarding sales plans, Zhu said that Aishanlin will lower prices first for their projects in popular areas to sell more homes. He thinks other construction companies will also offer discounts if they want to sell. He stated that people are careful with money now, so a good price is still very important.

**President Lai's Ten Speeches for National Unity: Taichung Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen Hopes for Economic Answers**

President Lai Ching-te gave his third speech in the "Ten Speeches for National Unity" series, focusing on the country's government system. Taichung Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen said today that a recent poll showed 70% of people want the president to talk about the economy. She suggested that the president should offer plans to fix economic problems.

President Lai Ching-te's third speech was about the "constitutional system." Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen was at a meeting for city and county council leaders. Before the meeting, she talked to reporters about the president's speeches. She said that a poll from My-Formosa.com showed that almost 70% of people want the president to talk about the economy. She again suggested that if the president has time to give more speeches, he should discuss economic topics that people care about.

Lu Hsiu-yen said that Taiwan's current international economy is very difficult. The New Taiwan Dollar has gone from 32 to 29 against the US dollar, which is hurting companies that sell goods abroad. This year is a very tough year for the economy. Life insurance companies are also losing a lot of money because the New Taiwan Dollar is getting stronger, losing 50 billion in just a few days. She worries about their ability to pay money in the future.

Lu Hsiu-yen hopes that if the president gives more speeches, he will talk about economic and daily life issues that people care about. She mentioned problems like exchange rates, bad export conditions, taxes, energy, and natural gas supply. She wants to know what plans the country has to deal with these problems and make people feel better.

**Nikkei: Taiwan's Second Largest Chipmaker UMC Aims for Advanced 6-Nanometer Technology**

According to Nikkei Asia, UMC (United Microelectronics Corporation), Taiwan's second-biggest chipmaker, is thinking about making more advanced chips. Currently, TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are the main companies in this field.

Four sources said that UMC is looking for new ways to grow, possibly by making 6-nanometer chips. These 6-nanometer chips can be used for advanced Wi-Fi, radio, and Bluetooth chips, AI accelerators for many uses, and main processors for TVs and cars.

Many sources also said that UMC is looking into working with other companies, for example, expanding its partnership with US chipmaker Intel to make 12-nanometer chips. They plan to start working together in Arizona, USA, by 2027, which will include 6-nanometer technology.

UMC's finance chief, Liu Chi-tung, told Nikkei Asia that UMC continues to explore more advanced chip technologies. However, he also said that making real progress would depend on partnerships and working together to share the financial cost.

Liu did not say if UMC would expand its work with Intel beyond the current 12-nanometer process. Intel did not comment to Nikkei Asia.

Three sources mentioned that UMC is also exploring expanding its advanced chip packaging business.

UMC is the world's fourth-largest chip foundry. With growing tensions between the US and China, UMC is facing pressure from China, which wants to make more semiconductors locally and support its own companies like SMIC.

In terms of income, SMIC has passed UMC to become the world's third-largest chipmaker. Its market value is three times that of UMC, thanks to China's local demand and strong financial support.

A supply chain manager said that UMC knows that there is more competition in making older, more common semiconductors. To stay strong in the market, it needs to find new ways to grow.

The manager said that because China wants to make its own semiconductors, some of UMC's Chinese customers are now giving their orders to local chipmakers. This trend makes it more urgent for UMC to find new opportunities.

However, many industry leaders said that the biggest challenge for UMC to start making 6-nanometer chips is the huge amount of money needed for equipment. Also, finding enough customers to use this extra production will be difficult.

Liu Chi-tung said that if UMC goes into advanced chipmaking, the company will use a "lighter asset" approach. This means they will look for partners to share the costs instead of investing in all the equipment themselves.

UMC's spending on equipment this year is only US$1.8 billion, as the demand for older semiconductors is not growing as fast as expected. SMIC, however, is spending over US$7 billion.

UMC is a major maker of common semiconductors and serves many different customers, industries, and uses. Its customers include global chip developers like Qualcomm, MediaTek, Realtek, Infineon, and Texas Instruments.
