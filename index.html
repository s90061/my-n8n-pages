            <h1>Financial Supervisory Commission: Public Banks Can Lend About NT$30-50 Billion Each Month for New Youth Housing Loans</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced today that new housing loan applications for young people, called "New Youth Housing Loans," that get money after September 1 will not count towards a special limit in the Banking Act. This change helps young people get home loans from public banks when there were no funds available before. In the past year, public banks offered about NT$30 billion to NT$50 billion each month for these loans, which is enough to meet the demand.</p>
            <p>Also, life insurance companies do not offer New Youth Housing Loans, but they can offer regular home loans. Cai Huoyan, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC Insurance Bureau, added that six life insurance companies have given out NT$294.3 billion in home loans by the end of August. On September 3, the FSC also met with these six companies to learn about their home loan services. These companies believe they can offer another NT$330 billion in new home loans by the end of 2026. So, if people need a home loan, they can also ask life insurance companies.</p>
            <p>Section 72-2 of the Banking Act is often called the "real estate loan limit." It says that banks cannot lend more than 30% of their total deposits and money from selling financial bonds for building homes and businesses. This rule is to make sure banks do not put too much money into long-term loans and real estate.</p>
            <p>In 2018, the FSC listed some loans that do not count towards this limit. These include loans for building or buying schools, hospitals, government buildings, long-term care centers, public housing, factories, and urban renewal projects. Also, working capital loans for construction companies doing these projects are not counted. This means that New Youth Housing Loans are now added to this list of exceptions, the first time since 2018. The FSC officially announced this rule today, and it is effective starting September 1.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked if removing New Youth Housing Loans from this rule might cause problems in the housing market again. Tong Zheng-zhang, the head of the FSC Banking Bureau, said in a regular press conference that Premier Cho Jung-tai is very concerned about this. He stressed that there must be a way to check loans. Before, some loans did not follow the policy's original goal. So, the Ministry of Finance has asked public banks to control these loans better, by checking applications carefully and reviewing loans after they are given. They have also taken back over 5,000 bad loans.</p>
            <p>The real estate loan limit cannot be more than 30%. Mr. Tong pointed out that banks usually set their own limits even lower, for example, around 28.5%. Overall, the ratio for all national banks under Section 72-2 of the Banking Act is 26.04%. For the eight major public banks, the ratio is 27.61%, with Cooperative Bank having a higher ratio of 28.3%. This change for New Youth Housing Loans will help solve the problem. Although it is hard to guess how many people will apply, public banks have given out NT$30 billion to NT$50 billion per month for New Youth Housing Loans in the past year, which should meet the needs.</p>
            <p>Regarding whether the FSC has talked with the Central Bank about controlling real estate concentration, Mr. Tong said that financial government offices have ways to communicate and respect the Central Bank's role. Currently, the percentage of bad home loans is about 0.08%, which is much lower than the 0.16% for all bank loans. This shows that banks are doing a good job with real estate loans. This change is not about giving out more money, but about helping people use the Youth Home Purchase Plan so they do not miss out on loans because of limits. For loans for new apartments in urban renewal projects or old building reconstruction, they will be treated as regular home loans and will not get special rules.</p>
            <p>The special interest rate for New Youth Housing Loans will last until the end of July next year. People are watching to see if this deadline will change. Mr. Tong said that this plan starts from September 1. He explained that if all previous New Youth Housing Loans were excluded from the limit, the amount of money available would suddenly become very large, which could affect the housing market. For now, the plan runs until the end of July next year. After that, the Ministry of Finance will review and adjust it as needed.</p>
