            <h1>Abbas at UN General Assembly: Hamas Will Not Govern Gaza After War</h1>
            <p>Palestinian Authority President Abbas told the United Nations Assembly through a video today that Palestinians are against the attack on Israel by the armed group Hamas in 2023. He promised that Hamas will not help govern the Gaza Strip after the war and must give up its weapons.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Abbas spoke to the UN General Assembly. He said that Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have "suffered a war of killing, damage, hunger, and being forced to leave their homes because of Israel."</p>
            <p>Abbas said that the Palestinian authorities "do not support" the attack by the Palestinian armed group Hamas on October 7, 2023, and that Hamas does not speak for all Palestinians.</p>
            <p>Abbas also shared his ideas for how the Palestinian areas should be governed after the Israel-Hamas war. He said that the Palestinian Authority is "ready to take full control of governing and keeping things safe."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Hamas will not be involved in governing," and they must give their weapons to the Palestinian authorities.</p>
            <p>In addition, Abbas was happy that France, the UK, and Canada recently said they recognize a Palestinian state. He asked other countries that have not done so to do the same.</p>
            <p>He also said, "We announce that we are ready to work with US President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia, France, the United Nations, and all partners to make the peace plan supported by the UN General Assembly happen."</p>
            <p>Finally, Abbas added that even though the war is very difficult, Palestinians "will not leave our homes."</p>

            <h1>Ingiant to Buy Color Filter Equipment and Intangible Assets from Japan's Toppan</h1>
            <p>Ingiant, a company that makes small and medium-sized screens, announced important news today. Its board of directors agreed to buy equipment and special rights for color filters from TOPPAN Inc. in Japan.</p>
            <p>Ingiant Technology said that TOPPAN Inc. in Japan plans to close its color filter production line. TOPPAN wants to sell or give the rights to use the machines and special knowledge related to these products to Ingiant. The board of directors agreed to let the general manager sign sales contracts, license contracts, and share transfer contracts. This will happen after all checks are done and if it follows rules and is good for the company. If anything is unclear or needs to change because of laws, the general manager can handle it.</p>
            <p>Ingiant also explained that other contracts for this deal will be discussed by the board and decided on later, once all documents are ready and follow the rules.</p>
            <p>In January, Ingiant announced that its parent company, Toppan Holdings, decided to sell all its shares (53.1%) in Ingiant to Juyi Investment Company. The plan was to transfer the shares in two parts, and it was expected to finish by late August this year. However, Toppan has not made any announcements about this since then.</p>

            <h1>China Starts Trade and Investment Barrier Investigation Against Mexico, Threatens Counter-Tariffs</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce announced tonight that it is starting an investigation into Mexico's trade and investment rules. This is because Mexico plans to raise taxes on cars and other products from China. China said it would take actions if needed.</p>
            <p>On September 25, China's Ministry of Commerce said it has first information that Mexico plans to increase import taxes. This plan was in Mexico's official newspaper on September 9, 2025. Mexico wants to raise taxes on products from China and other countries that do not have free trade agreements with Mexico. China believes this will hurt Chinese companies that trade and invest there. So, China decided to start an investigation into Mexico's rules from September 25, 2025.</p>
            <p>The announcement said that the investigation will look at Mexico's plan to raise import taxes on products like cars and car parts, clothes, plastic items, steel, home appliances, aluminum, toys, furniture, shoes, leather goods, paper, motorcycles, and glass. Other rules Mexico has made recently that limit trade and investment with China will also be part of this investigation.</p>
            <p>The announcement also stated that this investigation will last for six months from today. In special situations, it can be longer, but not more than three extra months.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce also released a press statement to explain its action.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that the US is currently putting high taxes on many products. Because of this, countries should work together against one-sided actions and protecting only their own country. He said countries should not hurt others because of pressure. If Mexico raises its taxes by itself, it will harm countries like China, even if it follows WTO rules. It will also make doing business in Mexico less certain and make companies less likely to invest there. China strongly disagrees with this.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Chinese spokesperson said that China will take necessary actions to protect its fair and legal rights based on the situation.</p>
            <p>On September 10, Mexico's government said it would raise the tax on cars from China and other countries without trade agreements to 50%. This big change to import taxes is to keep jobs safe. Experts think Mexico is doing this to make the US happy.</p>
            <p>On September 11, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government does not want problems with countries like China because of these planned tax increases.</p>
            <p>After this, China's Ministry of Commerce quickly told Mexico to think again. It said that Mexico's choice to raise taxes by itself would seem like giving in to "one-sided bullying."</p>
            <p>Mexico buys the most cars from China. Currently, there is a 20% tax on these cars. If the tax goes up a lot to 50%, it will seriously hurt China's car industry.</p>
