            <h1>Trump Threatens Up to 25% Tariffs on India if Trade Deal Fails</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 29 (CNA) â€“ Today, US President Donald Trump said that if the United States and India cannot agree on a trade deal, he will add up to 25% tariffs on goods from India sold in the US.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that when a reporter asked if India would face 20% to 25% tariffs, Trump answered, "Yes, I think so. India is my friend."</p>
            <p>On July 28, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC, a financial news channel, that more talks are needed for the trade deal with India, which has been delayed.</p>
            <p>Greer said, "They have shown a strong wish to open some markets. Of course, we want to continue talking with them. But I think we need to talk more with our Indian friends to understand how much they want to do."</p>
            <p>In recent trade deals, Trump has insisted that other countries open markets that were closed before. However, the US and India have not yet said what the specific problems are. Last week, India's commerce minister was hopeful about reaching a deal with the US before Trump's August 1 deadline.</p>
            <p>Trump has not yet sent a tariff letter to India, like he did to more than ten other countries. On April 2, Trump announced he would raise tariffs on Indian goods sold in the US to 26%. But he soon stopped these "equal" tariffs.</p>
