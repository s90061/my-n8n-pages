            <h1>Dutch Foreign Minister Resigns After Cabinet Disagrees on Israel Sanctions</h1>
            <p>The Dutch Foreign Minister, Caspar Veldkamp, resigned today. This happened because the Dutch government could not agree on new rules to punish Israel.</p>
            <p>After he resigned, Veldkamp's party, the New Social Contract Party, also left the group of parties that run the government. This made the political situation in the Netherlands more difficult.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Veldkamp said he wanted to take new steps to pressure Israel. He was concerned about Israel's strong actions against Hamas in the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Last month, the Netherlands announced that two Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben Gvir (National Security Minister) and Bezalel Smotrich (Finance Minister), were not welcome in their country.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Netherlands also signed a statement with 20 other countries. This statement criticized Israel's plan to build more settlements in the West Bank. The countries called this plan "unacceptable and against international law."</p>
            <p>But today, the government could not agree on new ways to pressure Israel. Veldkamp told the Dutch news agency ANP that he "could not take any meaningful extra steps."</p>
            <p>He also said, "As Foreign Minister, I felt blocked when trying to set up the necessary process."</p>
            <p>Veldkamp said that his ideas for more actions against Israel were "seriously discussed" first. However, they faced problems in several government meetings.</p>
            <p>Since the war started on October 7, 2023, after Hamas attacked Israel, the Dutch government has faced many protests. People have protested against Israel's military actions.</p>
            <p>A big protest in The Hague had between 100,000 and 150,000 people. It was the largest protest in the Netherlands in 20 years.</p>

            <h1>Sterile Cotton Swabs Are Medical Items: Importing Without Approval Can Lead to Big Fines</h1>
            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Taiwan said today that some cotton swabs are medical items. These are cotton swabs that say "sterile," "disinfected," or "for wound cleaning." The FDA reminds people that if they bring these cotton swabs from other countries or buy them online, they must follow the law. If they do not, they could pay a fine of up to 2 million New Taiwan Dollars (NT$).</p>
            <p>News reports recently talked about a person in Tainan. Two years ago, this person bought cotton swabs from Taobao, an online store. Recently, police came with an arrest warrant. The person was held for one night and had to pay a fine of NT$100,000. This caused a lot of discussion.</p>
            <p>Qian Jia-hong, who leads a team at the FDA, explained that cotton swabs have two uses. If the package clearly says "sterile," "disinfected," or "for wound cleaning," then it is a medical item. If the cotton swab is just for cleaning skin and not for medical treatment, it is a normal product.</p>
            <p>Qian Jia-hong also said that there are rules for selling medical items online. Only certain medical items can be sold on the internet. The sellers must be special medical device shops or pharmacies. The products must also have a special permit from Taiwan. Sellers must show the product name and permit number on their website. People who buy things online should always check for this information.</p>
            <p>He gave an example about medical cotton swabs. If you buy medical cotton swabs for yourself, you can bring up to 200 of them into Taiwan easily. You do not need special permission from the FDA. But you can only do this once every six months.</p>
            <p>If you want to bring more than 200 medical cotton swabs for yourself, Qian Jia-hong said you must apply for special permission. You need to send documents and pay a fee. You can only apply for enough cotton swabs for six months of use. If someone makes or brings in medical items without permission, they can be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$2 million, according to the Medical Device Act.</p>
            <p>Qian Jia-hong said that even though you can apply to bring medical items for yourself, "there is a fee. So, people might need to think if what they buy is worth the cost." He advises people to be careful when buying things abroad. Check if they are medical items and know the rules about how many you can bring and if you can bring them yourself. This helps avoid problems.</p>
            <p>About the person in Tainan who was fined NT$100,000 for buying too many cotton swabs online, Qian Jia-hong explained more. He said the fine was not because of the Medical Device Act. It was because the person did not appear in court when asked. The police are still looking into the case. "The court has not made a final decision yet, so we do not know all the details," he said.</p>
            <p>The FDA added that they are checking online sales of medical items more often. If they find any illegal selling of medical items, they will investigate and deal with it by law. If someone tries to sell or give away medical items that were made or brought in without permission, they could go to prison for up to three years. They could also be detained or fined up to NT$10 million, or both, according to the Medical Device Act.</p>

            <h1>Trump Touches World Cup Trophy as 2026 Draw is Announced for December 5th</h1>
            <p>Today, the President of the United States, Mr. Trump, said that the drawing for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will happen on December 5th in Washington, D.C. He also joked and asked if he could keep the World Cup trophy.</p>
            <p>The 2026 World Cup will have 48 teams playing. The drawing event will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Mr. Trump recently made himself the head of this arts center. He said this was to fight against "woke culture."</p>
            <p>Mr. Trump announced this news in his office at the White House with Mr. Gianni Infantino, the President of FIFA. Mr. Trump said, "This is the biggest event, maybe the biggest event in sports."</p>
            <p>The United States, Canada, and Mexico will all host the 2026 World Cup together. Mr. Trump made sure to say that the World Cup will happen while he is president.</p>
            <p>Mr. Infantino, who has a good relationship with Mr. Trump, brought the World Cup trophy to Mr. Trump's meeting with reporters today. He even let Mr. Trump touch the trophy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Infantino said, "Usually, only the head of FIFA, the leader of the country that wins, and the players from the winning team can touch this trophy. This is because it is only for winners. And since you are also a winner, you can certainly touch it."</p>
            <p>Mr. Trump, who won the election again last year, held the trophy with both hands. He jokingly asked, "Can I keep it? This is a very nice gold item."</p>
            <p>Mr. Trump also hinted that the President of Russia, Mr. Putin, might come to the World Cup.</p>
            <p>He showed a photo that Mr. Putin sent him last week after a meeting in Alaska. Mr. Trump said Mr. Putin "really hopes" to come to the World Cup. He added, "He may or may not come," depending on whether there is peace in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The United States was chosen to co-host the 2026 World Cup in 2018, during Mr. Trump's first time as president.</p>
