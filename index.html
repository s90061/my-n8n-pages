            <h1>Taipei Prosecutors' Office Chief Holds Meeting with Police and Investigators to Stop Interference in Recall Cases</h1>
            <p>To help with the recall vote investigation for the 11th group of lawmakers, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office has created a special team. The chief prosecutor, Wang Chun-li, visited the Taipei City Investigation Bureau and the Taipei City Police Department yesterday and today. He held meetings to discuss how to stop bribery and other actions that might interfere with the recall process. He wanted to understand how they are getting ready for this important work.</p>
            <p>During the meetings, Wang Chun-li said that fair elections are very important for a democratic government and for a country to be honest. He explained that this investigation is not just about stopping bribery and violence. It also needs to focus on using the Anti-Infiltration Act more effectively. They must carefully check any suspicious money from outside Taiwan. They also need to improve how they find out if foreign forces are trying to interfere with the recall vote through certain groups or people.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that because communication technology is common, false information can spread very quickly and cause big problems. He said that all departments must investigate and deal with such cases quickly and strictly. This is to stop the bad effects that spreading false information can cause.</p>
            <p>Wang Chun-li also pointed out that some bad people or foreign forces might set up illegal gambling, offering high payouts for a specific outcome of the recall vote. They might try to trick voters into betting money and then voting a certain way to win. This can seriously affect the election results. So, he said it is very important to strictly investigate these illegal gambling operations. The goal is to stop this kind of gambling and prevent it from influencing the recall vote.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office stated that they will work with police, investigation, anti-corruption, and immigration departments in their area. They will work as a team and follow the rule that they will investigate everything they hear about and handle every case that has evidence. They will strongly fight against bribery and stop any illegal actions.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office also noted that their "Area Investigation Contact Center" is open 24 hours a day to receive reports from the public about cases that interfere with recall. If people find any illegal activities related to the recall, they can call the tip-off hotline at 0800-024-099 to provide information. This way, everyone can help keep elections fair and honest.</p>

            <h1>Myanmar Military Offers Money to Anti-Government Fighters Who Stop Fighting</h1>
            <p>The military government in Myanmar announced today that they will give money to fighters who leave anti-government armed groups. They want these fighters to "return to the right path" before the elections that are planned for the end of the year.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Myanmar has been in a civil war since the military took power in 2021. There have been many pro-democracy fighters and rebel groups from different ethnic groups, making it hard for the military government.</p>
            <p>The military has lost many battles. They say that the elections, which will happen around the end of the year, are a way to achieve peace. However, groups that oppose the military and international observers say that these election plans are not real and are just a trick.</p>
            <p>The state-run newspaper, "Global New Light of Myanmar," reported today that those who bring their weapons and ammunition and "return to the right path" will receive a "specific amount" of money. But the newspaper, which speaks for the military government, did not say exactly how much money would be given.</p>
            <p>The report also stated that since they announced "welcome for defectors" two weeks ago, 14 fighters who were against the military takeover have given up. These include 12 men and 2 women.</p>
            <p>The report said: "These people chose to stop fighting with weapons because they want a peaceful life that follows the law."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan White Team Lets Opponent Score Only 3 Points in Last Quarter, Wins Big Against UAE in Jones Cup</h1>
            <p>In the Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament today, the Taiwan White team played against the UAE team. The game was very close for the first three parts. But in the last part, the Taiwan White team played very strong defense. They only allowed the other team to score 3 points. In the end, Taiwan White won the game 88 to 66. This was their third win in this tournament.</p>
            <p>Taiwan White was ahead by a small amount, 19 to 17, after the first part. In the second part, their guard, Gu Mao-wei-jia, scored 8 points and made 4 assists in that part alone. He helped his teammates attack well. By the middle of the game, Taiwan White was ahead 45 to 37.</p>
            <p>In the third part, the UAE team started to play better, but Taiwan White also played well. Both teams scored 26 points in that part. After three parts, the home team was still ahead by 8 points.</p>
            <p>In the last part, Taiwan White played even stronger defense. Also, the UAE's main scorer, Demarco Christion Dickerson, who was the top scorer in the tournament, twisted his ankle and had to leave the game. Taiwan White scored 17 points while UAE only scored 3 points in that part. This difference helped Taiwan White secure their win early.</p>
            <p>Li Jia-kang, the oldest player on the Taiwan White team, only scored 7 points in the whole game. But he did a great job defending Dickerson, making it very hard for Dickerson to score. Dickerson only made 1 out of 10 shots in the entire game. After the game, Li Jia-kang said, "The coach told me before the game not to let the opponent feel comfortable. I also want to show the younger players that even if you are not playing your best, you can still help the team win by playing good defense."</p>
            <p>Yeh Wei-jie, who went to college in the U.S. after high school, made 3 out of 7 three-point shots today. He was especially good in the third part when he made 3 three-point shots in a row. This made the fans in the stadium very excited.</p>
            <p>After the game, he said that his outside shots have not been very consistent since the start of the tournament. "So I just try my best to take advantage of open shots during the game and make the shots I should make."</p>
