            <h1>US Federal Reserve Likely to Cut Interest Rates, New Taiwan Dollar Rises to 30.522</h1>
            <p>The US job market report was weaker than expected, making it almost certain that the US Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in September. Because the US dollar became weaker and the Taiwan stock market went up, the New Taiwan dollar got much stronger during the day. It went up by 1.61 cents at one point. But the central bank worked to stop it from rising too quickly. So, the New Taiwan dollar closed at 30.522, which is 9.3 cents higher. This is the highest it has been in half a month. The total amount of money traded in the Taipei and Yuanta foreign exchange markets was 1.8675 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>The newest report on US jobs showed much fewer new jobs than people thought. This means the job market is cooling down very quickly. So, it is almost certain that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. The US dollar index fell, which made other currencies stronger.</p>
            <p>Even though the job data made investors worry about the US economy, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which is closely linked to the Taiwan stock market, went up. Also, the Taipei International Semiconductor Exhibition is coming soon, and this topic made the Taiwan stock market rise.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market opened higher today and reached 24729.96 points. This was the highest point ever during trading. Later, the gains became smaller, but it still closed up by 52.8 points at 24547.38 points. This is still the highest closing point ever.</p>
            <p>With the US dollar falling, a lot of money coming into Taiwan, and the stock market rising, the New Taiwan dollar had three good reasons to get stronger. It opened at 30.60 against the US dollar today. Then, it quickly became much stronger, passing the 30.5 mark very fast. It went as high as 30.454, a big jump of 1.61 cents. However, the central bank worked hard to slow down its rise. So, it closed at 30.522, up by 9.3 cents, keeping the total rise within 1 cent.</p>
            <p>Foreign exchange traders said that the US dollar was weaker around the world. Also, foreign investors and investment trusts sent money into Taiwan today. Companies that export goods were also waiting and did not hurry to sell their foreign currency. This made the New Taiwan dollar get stronger without much resistance. If the Taiwan stock market keeps doing well and moves towards 25000 points, more money will come in. This could make the New Taiwan dollar continue to get stronger.</p>
            <p>Foreign exchange traders said that two things are important to watch in the short term. First, where the Taiwan stock market is going. Second, the US Federal Reserve's meeting in September to decide on interest rates. The market has already mostly reacted to the idea of a rate cut. But how the Fed talks after the meeting â€“ if it sounds more gentle (dovish) or more strict (hawkish), and if it will cut rates by two or three times this year â€“ will affect how the financial markets develop later. They think that after the Fed meeting, the market's direction will be clearer.</p>

            <h1>Former Technician from Banqiao District Office in New Taipei City Charged for Helping Elevator Company Get Benefits</h1>
            <p>A former technician named Zeng from the Public Works Department of Banqiao District Office in New Taipei City is accused of creating false reports for re-inspections. This allowed an elevator maintenance company to avoid paying at least NT$20,000 in late fees. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office recently charged Mr. Zeng with crimes like a public official giving unfair benefits in matters he managed.</p>
            <p>According to the charges, Mr. Zeng worked as a technician in the Public Works Department of the Banqiao District Office in New Taipei City from February 25, 2022, to August 31, 2024. He was in charge of a project to buy services for "Elevator Maintenance for Fuzhong Pedestrian Bridge in Banqiao District, New Taipei City for 2024." He was responsible for everything from inviting bids to checking the work and accepting it later.</p>
            <p>A woman named Chen worked for the company that won the elevator maintenance contract. She was responsible for preparing construction photos and other documents for the project. The contract said that the company had to maintain two elevators in 2024: the Jieyunti and Cihuiti at Exit 2 of Fuzhong MRT Station. They needed to replace the elevator cables by mid-June 2024 and take photos. Within 7 days of changing the cables, they had to send the photos to the district office for review. If they did not deliver goods or send documents on time, they would be fined NT$1,000 every day.</p>
            <p>The company changed the main cable of the Jieyunti elevator on March 7. But they did not send the required documents for review within 7 days, as the contract stated. They also waited until July 9, 2024, to change the main cable of the Cihuiti elevator. On July 8, 2024, Mr. Zeng wrote in the inspection report that the problems needed to be fixed by July 19. After that, Ms. Chen wrote false dates, making it seem that the main cables for the Jieyunti and Cihuiti elevators were replaced on May 27 and May 28, 2024, respectively. She then used false letters and photos of the work to get a second inspection.</p>
            <p>In the re-inspection report on July 19, 2024, Mr. Zeng wrote that the company's updated information met the contract's rules. He also checked boxes like "matches contract, drawings, and samples" and "not overdue." These were false statements. He made it seem that the company had finished all its work according to the contract. This helped the company avoid paying at least NT$20,000 in late fees.</p>
            <p>Also, when asking for payment and during the final check, Ms. Chen provided photos of the Jieyunti elevator maintenance that had false dates. She also changed the maintenance date for the Cihuiti elevator. This made people who didn't know the truth think that the company had finished the elevator repair and maintenance work. Because of this, the work was approved, and the company was paid.</p>
            <p>In addition, Mr. Zeng admitted that when he was handling another project called "Supply of Road Paving Materials for Banqiao District, New Taipei City in 2023," he also checked false boxes in the inspection report, saying that the materials met the contract's rules. This made it seem that the company's documents were correct and helped the company pass the inspection.</p>
            <p>Both Mr. Zeng and Ms. Chen admitted their actions during the investigation. The prosecutors charged Mr. Zeng with crimes like a public official giving unfair benefits in matters he managed and using false official documents, which is against the criminal law. Ms. Chen was charged with using false business documents.</p>
            <p>Regarding an accident where the Jieyunti elevator suddenly fell in 2024 and two people were hurt, the prosecutors said they are investigating if the company was also responsible for causing harm due to carelessness. This is a separate case.</p>
