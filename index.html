The US stock market went down today. This happened because President Trump announced new taxes on imported goods. People are worried about how this will affect trade.

The main stock indexes in the US, like the Dow Jones and S&P 500, all lost value. They were at very high levels last week, but now they are lower.

**Global Oil Prices Go Up**

Oil prices around the world increased today. This is because many people want to buy oil.

Even though a group called OPEC+ plans to make more oil, the strong demand still made prices go up. People were also thinking about new US taxes on goods, which added to the market's movement.
