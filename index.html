            <h1>Guardians Win with Home Runs, Manager Chen Chin-feng Says Batting with Runners on Base Needs Improvement</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City, July 17 (CNA) The Fubon Guardians baseball team won against the Uni-President Lions today. However, their points came only from Chang Yu-cheng's home runs. After the game, Guardians manager Chen Chin-feng said that getting players on base was not a problem for the team. But he added that the team needs to get better at scoring runs when players are on base.</p>
            <p>Today, the Fubon Guardians beat the Uni-President Lions 4-1. This was thanks to two 2-run home runs by Chang Yu-cheng. After the game, Guardians manager Chen Chin-feng said Chang Yu-cheng played very well. "But actually, we could have done better in this game," Chen Chin-feng stated. He pointed out that player Tsai Chia-yen, who bats second, missed two chances to score with runners in scoring position. Chen Chin-feng said this was not good.</p>
            <p>Chen Chin-feng mentioned that Tsai Chia-yen has been training in the minor league for some time. "So he needs to understand how to do these things. Because in a game, there are not many chances to hit, and not many good chances to score. He needs to calm down and take advantage of these chances. Sometimes, you don't even need a hit to score, so he still needs to learn," he said.</p>
            <p>Chen Chin-feng noted that the team does well in getting players on base. But when there are runners on base, they do not face the pitcher well. "If everyone is too eager to hit, you will lose your control. This is where we need to get better. Sometimes we do very well, and sometimes we are not very stable."</p>
            <p>In addition, Guardians starting pitcher Shawn Morimando threw 91 pitches over 6 innings in this game. He gave up 5 hits, walked 2 batters, and struck out 3. He did not give up any runs and pitched a good game, earning his 5th win of the season.</p>
            <p>Chen Chin-feng said that Morimando's situation is similar to Roenis Elias. They can suddenly have problems. For some time, the pitching and catching coaches have been trying to help the catcher guide the pitcher. "Now they (Morimando, Elias) are quite stable on the field by themselves. I am very thankful to the pitching and catching coaches for this," Chen Chin-feng said. (Editor: Chen Ching-fang) 1140717</p>

            <p>Tokyo, July 17 (CNA) The latest poll from Japan's Jiji Press shows that the approval rate for the Shigeru Ishiba cabinet has dropped by 6.2 percentage points from last month, falling to 20.8%. This is the lowest it has been since he became prime minister in October last year.</p>
            <p>The Jiji Press poll was conducted from July 11 to 14. The results show that the Ishiba cabinet's approval rate fell to 20.8%, which is a new low since it took office. The disapproval rate for the Ishiba cabinet went up by 6.6 percentage points from last month, rising to 55.0%. This is a new high since it took office.</p>
            <p>The Ishiba cabinet's previous lowest approval rate was 20.9% in May this year. In June, a poll showed that the approval rate for the Ishiba cabinet went up to 27.0% after Shinjiro Koizumi became the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries and solved the problem of rice shortages and high rice prices. But now, it has dropped back to the May level.</p>
            <p>When people were asked why they supported the cabinet (they could choose more than one answer), 8.9% said "there are no other suitable people." 5.2% said "I trust the prime minister." 3.3% said "I support the prime minister's political party."</p>
            <p>When people were asked why they did not support the Ishiba cabinet (they could choose more than one answer), 29.7% said "I cannot expect anything from it." 21.9% said "it lacks leadership." 21.6% said "its policies are not good."</p>
            <p>Regarding political party support rates, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's support rate dropped by 2.5 percentage points from last month, to 16.4%. The largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party, gained 1.1 percentage points, reaching 5.5%. A newer party, Sanseito, gained 2.2 percentage points, reaching 4.7%, becoming the third-largest party.</p>
            <p>The Democratic Party for the People and Komeito both had 3.1%. Reiwa Shinsengumi had 2.1%. The Japanese Communist Party had 1.6%. Nippon Ishin no Kai had 1.5%. The Japan Conservative Party had 1.1%. The Social Democratic Party had 0.3%. Those with no party preference made up 54.9%.</p>
            <p>This poll surveyed 2,000 people aged 18 and older across the country. The surveys were done in person. 59.0% of the surveys were completed.</p>
            <p>Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) announced its poll results on July 14. NHK conducted its poll from July 11 to 13. The results showed that the Ishiba cabinet's approval rate was 31%, the same as last week. The Ishiba cabinet's disapproval rate went up by 3 percentage points, rising to 53%.</p>
            <p>The Japanese House of Councillors election officially started on July 3, and voting will take place on July 20.</p>
            <p>The NHK poll asked people if they would vote. 48% said "definitely will go." 22% said "plan to go." 7% said "have not decided yet." 5% said "will not go." 16% said "have already voted using the early voting system."</p>
            <p>The results showed that 64% of people combined answered "definitely will go to vote" and "have already voted using the early voting system." This is 5 percentage points more than the last House of Councillors election poll conducted three years ago. In that poll, 59% of people gave these two answers, and the actual voter turnout was 52.05%.</p>
            <p>This poll shows that young people are more likely to vote. It will be interesting to see how this affects the overall voter turnout.</p>
            <p>When people were asked if they cared about this House of Councillors election, 32% said "care very much." 44% said "care somewhat." 16% said "do not care much." 4% said "do not care at all."</p>
            <p>When asked "What is most important to you when deciding who to vote for in this election?" (with 7 options listed), 29% chose "social security and low birth rate." 28% chose "measures for high rice prices and general prices." 8% each chose "response to US tariffs" and "politics and money issues." 7% each chose "diplomacy and security" and "policies related to foreigners." 1% chose "optional different surnames for married couples."</p>
