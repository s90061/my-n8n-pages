            <h1>TikTok's US Business Reportedly Moves to Investor Group; Oracle and Others Own Over 80%</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok's business in the U.S. will be controlled by a group of investors. This is part of a plan that the U.S. and China are finalizing. The investor group includes companies like Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
            <p>Sources told The Wall Street Journal that this agreement was discussed by U.S. and Chinese officials this week in Madrid. A new American company will be created to run TikTok's U.S. operations. American investors will own about 80% of this new company. Chinese shareholders will own about 20%.</p>
            <p>Most of the people on the new company's board will be American. The U.S. government will choose one person for the board.</p>
            <p>The talks about TikTok are just one part of the difficult trade discussions between the U.S. and China. Both sides also need to talk about other tough issues, such as what will happen to Nvidia's exports to China. Politicians from both main parties in the U.S. are worried about TikTok because of national security. Many young Americans use the app.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal also said, according to sources, that current TikTok users in the U.S. will have to move to a special U.S. app. TikTok is already making and testing this new app. TikTok's engineers will rebuild the system that suggests content. They will use technology that they are allowed to use from their parent company, ByteDance.</p>
            <p>Oracle, a big American technology company and a long-time partner of TikTok, will manage user data in Texas. Silver Lake, a private equity company, and Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital company, are well-known investors in technology.</p>
            <p>The details of the plan are still being discussed and might change. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new order today. This order extends the time for TikTok until December 16. This is the fourth time he has extended the deadline.</p>
            <p>ByteDance's current shareholders, like Susquehanna International, KKR, and General Atlantic, will also become shareholders in the new company. Together, they will own about 80% of the shares. Chinese shareholders will own less than 20% to follow a U.S. law passed last year. This law says that ByteDance must sell its TikTok assets in the U.S., or TikTok will not be allowed in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Officials from both the U.S. and China will carefully check the details of this deal. They are still worried about possible risks to national security.</p>

            <h1>AIDC Teams Up with Thunder Tiger to Develop Medium-to-Large Unmanned Helicopters</h1>
            <p>AIDC announced today that it is officially working with Thunder Tiger Technology. They will both develop a new generation of medium-to-large unmanned helicopters, called the T-400. This cooperation will make Taiwan's drone supply chain stronger. All parts, from design to making many drones, will be done in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Thunder Tiger's T-400 is a medium-to-large unmanned helicopter. Its main rotor is 4 meters wide. It can be used for many things, like defense spying, carrying goods over long distances, exploring for fish far at sea, and checking offshore wind turbines. It meets both military and civilian needs.</p>
            <p>AIDC explained that Thunder Tiger will lead the design, making, and putting together of the T-400. AIDC will help quickly with important issues during development. These issues include checking the body structure, reducing shaking, and managing heat. This will make sure the product works very well and is dependable. Both companies will work together to make the design better, improve how it works, and develop all its features. This will make the T-400 as good as similar medium-to-large unmanned helicopters in Europe and America.</p>
            <p>AIDC said that their company has been making airplanes for many years. They have a lot of experience in research, making things, testing, and putting systems together. Thunder Tiger has skills in designing and testing drones. In recent years, they have worked hard to develop medium-to-large drones and have done very well. Both companies are part of the Taiwan Excellent Drone International Business Opportunity Alliance (TEDIBOA). This partnership will bring their strengths together and make them even stronger. It will make Taiwan's drone supply chain independent. From development to making many drones, everything will be done in Taiwan. This will create a strong drone industry.</p>
            <p>AIDC stressed that the project is now at the prototype stage. AIDC is using all its main skills to help Thunder Tiger develop the drone faster. They are also planning how to make many drones by themselves. This will ensure good product quality and a steady supply chain in the future. This will help them get new business opportunities in the market.</p>
