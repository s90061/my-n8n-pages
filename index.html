Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the world of work. While some people worry that AI will take jobs, experts believe that new jobs are also appearing, and the way we work will change significantly. Businesses are now looking for employees with different skills that can work together with AI tools.

Jobs that involve repeating the same tasks or processing a lot of information might be affected by AI. However, there is a growing need for "human-centric" skills. These include creativity, which helps in developing new ideas, and critical thinking, which means solving problems in a smart way. Emotional intelligence, or understanding and managing feelings, is also becoming very important for roles that involve working with people.

Companies want employees who can adapt and learn new things, especially about AI. This often means people need to improve their existing skills or learn completely new ones. For example, knowing how to use AI programs or understanding data analysis will be valuable. The future of work is not just about machines replacing humans, but about humans and machines working together more effectively.

**Global Efforts to Tackle Plastic Pollution**

Plastic pollution is a huge problem for our planet, harming oceans, wildlife, and even human health. To fight this issue, countries around the world are now working together. Representatives from many nations recently met in Nairobi, Kenya, for talks about a new global agreement on plastics.

The main goal of these talks is to create a legally binding treaty. This means countries would have to follow strict rules to stop plastic pollution. The agreement aims to cover the entire journey of plastic, from when it is first made to when it is thrown away. This includes how plastic is produced, how it is used, and how it is recycled or disposed of.

While many countries agree that a treaty is needed, there are disagreements on how strong the rules should be. For instance, some nations and environmental groups want to limit the amount of new plastic that is produced. However, countries that produce a lot of plastic are often against strict production limits. Despite these challenges, many see this global effort as a major step forward in protecting our environment from plastic waste.

**New Travel Trends for the Year Ahead**

If you're planning a trip soon, you might notice some new trends in how people travel. After a few years of changes, the travel industry is now focusing on different kinds of experiences. Many travellers are looking for more than just a typical holiday; they want to find something authentic and personal.

One popular trend is seeking out local experiences. People want to connect with the culture of a place, try local food, and explore areas away from the usual tourist spots. Sustainable travel is also growing, with more people choosing eco-friendly options and trying to reduce their impact on the environment. Another trend is "set-jetting," which means visiting places where famous TV shows or movies were filmed.

Work is also changing travel. More people are combining work and holidays, sometimes called "bleisure" trips, or even becoming "digital nomads" who work from different countries. To support these new ways of traveling, airlines are opening new routes, and there are more choices for unique accommodations. Whether it's for adventure, relaxation, or cultural discovery, travel is becoming more varied and personalised for everyone.`;
