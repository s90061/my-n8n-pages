Elon Musk's brain-implant company, Neuralink, has shared some encouraging initial findings from its human trials. The company implanted a chip into the brain of a patient with paralysis. This allows the individual to control a computer cursor using just their thoughts. The first patient, Noland Arbaugh, who suffered a spinal cord injury, can now play computer games and browse the internet more easily.

The technology records brain activity through the implant and sends the information wirelessly to a computer. Neuralink hopes to expand the functionality of the device so patients can control smartphones and other technologies. Although still in the early stages of development, this represents a significant step forward in assistive technology for people with disabilities. Scientists see the potential for Neuralink to treat neurological conditions. There are still ethical considerations and regulatory hurdles to consider.

**Japanese Artisans Embrace Digital Tools to Preserve Traditional Crafts**

In Japan, some traditional artisans are starting to use digital technology to keep their crafts alive. As younger generations pursue other careers, there's a growing concern about losing these skills. Craftsmen are now employing techniques like 3D printing and computer-aided design to streamline some processes. They are also using online platforms to reach new markets and share their knowledge.

While purists might object, many artisans see technology as a way to preserve their heritage. By using these tools to simplify repetitive tasks, they can focus on the creative aspects of their work. This initiative has helped them attract a younger audience interested in learning and appreciating the skills. It also helps them to find ways to keep these unique crafts going.
