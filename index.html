            <h1>Taiwan's Role in the UN is Important for the US, Says Chicago Official as General Assembly Begins</h1>
            <p>Next week, the United Nations General Assembly will start in New York. A newspaper in Illinois, USA, called "Daily Herald," published an article by an official from Taiwan's office in Chicago. The article asks the US to support Taiwan's involvement in UN meetings and systems. It also asks the US to work against China's wrong interpretation of UN Resolution 2758.</p>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly will begin on September 9th in New York. On September 1st, the "Daily Herald" newspaper in Illinois published the article by Yen-Feng Lei, who is the head of Taiwan's office in Chicago. The article's title is "Taiwan's Participation in the UN is Very Important for the United States."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lei wrote that an international system based on rules needs to be open, democratic, and work together with everyone. However, China is more and more trying to control UN systems to reach its own political goals. It is very important for the US to fight against these actions.</p>
            <p>If Taiwan joins the UN, it will help stop China from controlling these systems. Taiwan is also a good partner for the US to protect democratic rules and world stability.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is good at democratic governance, lasting development, and new technology. These strengths match many important goals of the UN. If Taiwan joins the UN, it will make international teamwork stronger. It will also stop Beijing from trying to control what everyone says in the world.</p>
            <p>The article says that Beijing continues to wrongly explain UN Resolution 2758. It uses false reasons to stop Taiwan from being part of UN systems. The resolution does not say that China owns Taiwan.</p>
            <p>If Taiwan continues to be left out, it will make the UN less trustworthy. It is dangerous if professional UN systems become too political. The UN started to help people all over the world, not to stop them.</p>
            <p>For example, people with Taiwanese passports cannot enter UN places, and Taiwanese reporters cannot cover UN events. This goes against basic human rights, like freedom of the press. Authoritarian governments are becoming stronger around the world. So, it is very important for Taiwan to be part of UN talks to keep open conversations, reliable information, and international law strong.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's involvement in the UN will help the UN focus on important global issues, instead of giving in to political pressure.</p>
            <p>Allowing Taiwan to join UN systems is not just about Taiwan. It is also about whether the UN is fair and works well. It is hoped that the US will help make sure Taiwan can join UN meetings and systems. This will protect future international cooperation from wrong political interference.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says 'Death Rumors' Are Fake News: 'I Was Very Active This Weekend'</h1>
            <p>Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump did not appear in public for several days, which was unusual. Soon after, rumors spread online that Trump had died. Today, he replied to these rumors, saying he had heard about them. He said they were "fake news" and stressed that he was "very active all weekend."</p>
            <p>Trump, who is 79 years old, often has public events since he returned to the White House. But last week, he did not show himself to the media for several days. Because of this, rumors about his death spread online. However, reporters saw Trump at a golf course during the weekend.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Trump announced in the Oval Office of the White House that the U.S. Space Command headquarters would move from Colorado to Alabama. He also answered questions from reporters. The press conference lasted about 48 minutes, and Trump looked fine.</p>
            <p>When the media asked about the widespread rumors of his death on social media, Trump said he had not seen them himself, but he had heard about them. He called it "a bit crazy" and said it was "fake news."</p>
            <p>Trump explained that he held several press conferences last week. Then, when he didn't hold one for two days, people started saying, "Something must have happened to him."</p>
            <p>He said he was on several shows, posted many updates on his own social media site, Truth Social, and visited some people. Last weekend was a holiday in the U.S. called Labor Day, and he stated, "I was very active all weekend."</p>
