On Friday, U.S. stocks mostly dropped as investors considered several major global events. Traders are particularly worried about the possibility of the U.S. getting directly involved in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, which is now in its second week. This geopolitical tension, along with uncertainties about the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions and continuing chip trade disputes with China, is contributing to a cautious atmosphere in the market. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines, reflecting these concerns among investors.

**Tencent Music's Shares Soar by Breaking Away from China's Price War**

Chinese technology investors, often tired of the constant price competition in the country's market, can now look at one area that is succeeding by doing the opposite: online music. Tencent Music's shares have notably increased, doubling in value, by not following the typical trend of lowering prices to gain customers. Instead, the company has found a way to grow its business and become more profitable in the online music sector, offering a different and more successful approach compared to many other tech companies in China.

**Nvidia Could Reach $5 Trillion Value as Analysts Raise Price Targets**

Nvidia is receiving new optimistic predictions after its shares rapidly increased over the past five years. Analysts are now suggesting that the chipmaker could grow into a company worth $5 trillion. The company's stock has already seen significant gains, and this new forecast suggests a continued strong performance in the coming years. This positive outlook is largely due to Nvidia's leading position in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market and its strong financial results.
