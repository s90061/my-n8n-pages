            <h1>President Meets New Belize Ambassador, Hopes to Visit Belize</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te today accepted the official documents from Katherine Meighan, the new Ambassador from Belize to Taiwan. The President said he hopes to visit Belize in the future to see the results of cooperation between the two countries.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, President Lai Ching-te, with Secretary-General Pan Meng-an from the Presidential Office and Deputy Minister Wu Chih-chung from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, welcomed Ambassador Katherine Meighan. The President said that Ms. Meighan is an old and good friend of Taiwan. She is a great graduate of National Chengchi University. After finishing her studies, she worked well in Belize's business world and served as the head of the Rotary Club in Belize, receiving much praise.</p>
            <p>The President noted that Ms. Meighan has worked closely with Taiwan's Embassy in Belize for many years. She often joined embassy events and welcomed many Taiwanese trade and investment groups. She has helped a lot to increase trade and business between the two countries.</p>
            <p>The President also said that Ms. Meighan has worked for a long time to help women and develop small and medium-sized businesses. These goals are similar to Taiwan's policies. He believes that Ms. Meighan's experience and ideas will help both countries improve in areas like education, gender equality, and trade cooperation.</p>
            <p>The President shared that next month, the two countries will celebrate 36 years of diplomatic relations. He is happy to see that trade between Taiwan and Belize has grown a lot since their economic cooperation agreement started. In July this year, Taiwan announced it would allow frozen white shrimp and other seafood products from Belize to be imported. He believes that with both sides working together, trade and investment will continue to grow.</p>
            <p>The President mentioned that he had spoken with Belize Prime Minister John BriceÃ±o before and admired his plans for the country. He hopes to visit Belize in the future to see the results of cooperation between the two countries in various fields.</p>
            <p>The President thanked Ms. Meighan for returning to Taiwan as an ambassador. This shows that the Belize government values the friendship between the two countries. He believes they can work together to achieve new growth, new results, and new milestones in their relationship.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Meighan said that the relationship between Taiwan and Belize is a good example of diplomacy. It is strong, lasting, and based on democratic values. Taiwan's support for Belize, through investments in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and technology, has helped Belize grow and has also made the friendship between the people stronger.</p>
            <p>Ms. Meighan explained that coming back to Taiwan as Belize's Ambassador shows that the trust between Taiwan and Belize is still strong and means a promise to make cooperation deeper. She will also work to expand cooperation beyond politics to include cultural and educational exchanges, to help both sides understand each other better. Through shared projects, academic exchanges, and new ideas in areas like technology and climate protection, they can move towards a better and more welcoming future together.</p>
            <p>Ms. Meighan stated that Belize is ready to make its partnership with Taiwan stronger. She also thanked Taiwan for its generous help to Belize and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, supporting their higher education and development.</p>
            <p>Ms. Meighan repeated that Belize strongly supports Taiwan's important participation in international events. She hopes that discussions will continue to turn the shared values of both countries into real benefits for families, businesses, and the nation.</p>
            <p>Ms. Meighan emphasized that friendship is not just a simple feeling, but a strong and shared mission. She hopes the friendship between Taiwan and Belize will continue to shine like a lighthouse. She believes that working together with good principles, respecting each other, and having long-lasting goodwill will lead both countries to a future of peace, success, and shared goals. The friendship between Taiwan and Belize will also be an example to help the world become more cooperative and friendly.</p>

            <h1>Franchise Association Asks for More Event Support to Help Taiwanese Brands Go Global</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Chain Stores and Franchise Association wants to help Taiwanese brands grow in other countries. Recently, its chairman, Wu Yung-chiang, met with James Huang, the head of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA). Wu Yung-chiang said that event business, like trade shows, is an important plan for the government. Taiwan needs to attract more international buyers. He suggested that the government should give more money to bring international buyers to Taiwan's exhibitions. This, along with tourism, will create more economic benefits.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan Chain Stores and Franchise Association released a press statement. It said that the association recently visited Osaka, Japan, and Melbourne, Australia, to learn about business and exhibitions. They also work with TAITRA. Wu Yung-chiang and other association leaders met with James Huang to talk about helping Taiwanese brands go global and supporting young people to start their own businesses.</p>
            <p>Wu Yung-chiang pointed out that currently, the government's support for each exhibition only covers the hotel costs for a few international buyers. This is not enough to truly help brands go global. For example, South Korea always pays for all hotel costs and invites at least 1,000 international buyers to meet. Taiwan could learn from this. Also, Taiwan could invite foreign brands to participate in exhibitions by "exchanging booths" with friendly countries. This would help Taiwanese brands enter markets abroad.</p>
            <p>James Huang replied that Taiwanese products are very competitive in the global market, especially in new markets like Southeast Asia. He gave an example of a bubble tea drink that costs up to NT$150. For local workers, buying such a drink can feel like improving their life quality. This shows that Taiwanese brands have great potential to grow in the international market. The franchise industry is also a key driver for young people to start businesses and find jobs. Many young people choose to join a franchise after graduation to save their first large sum of money. TAITRA will continue to help the franchise industry grow even stronger.</p>
            <p>In late August, the Taiwan Chain Stores and Franchise Association led a group to Melbourne, Australia. They talked with local businesses and found that most food franchises in Australia are international fast-food brands. There are fewer local food franchises. However, service industries like fitness, logistics, education, and long-term care have more chain stores. The group also visited Taiwanese brands like COCO, Jing Sheng Yu, and Gong Cha. They noticed that Australia has strict labor laws and high labor costs. The association will collect this information to help Taiwanese businesses that want to expand into Australia.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Chain Stores and Franchise Association announced that the Japan Franchise Association will visit Taiwan soon to attend the Taiwan Chain Stores and Franchise Autumn Exhibition. During the exhibition, from September 19 to 20, an international forum will be held. Important leaders from international chain companies will be invited, such as Kazuma Otsuka, the chairman and general manager of Taiwan Tsutaya Books; Deric Yeo, the Chief Operating Officer of Malaysia's US PIZZA group; and Jay Lim, the founder of Korea's pizza brand GOPIZZA. They will share information on international market trends, digital changes, and how to grow businesses in a way that helps the environment.</p>
