            <h1>Former Employee Held for Causing Trouble at Kaohsiung Hospital</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, there was a large group causing trouble at Botian Hospital in Kaohsiung. The Kaohsiung police made a special team to look into the case. So far, 31 people have come forward. A former employee named Chen is believed to be the leader. After questioning, the Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office asked the court to hold him in custody for crimes like using force. Six other people who helped were allowed to leave after paying bail of 30,000 to 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars. The rest were released without bail.</p>
            <p>Police officers from the Zuoying Branch of the Kaohsiung City Police Department explained that the incident happened around 3:40 AM yesterday. The police checked many security cameras to find the people involved. They caught Mr. Chen, the main suspect, and many others. They will continue to look for other people who were involved.</p>
            <p>The Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office announced tonight that Prosecutor Li Kan-ying led the criminal investigation team and the Zuoying Branch of the Kaohsiung City Police Department to investigate the case at Botian Hospital. This case involves disturbing public order, limiting freedom, causing injury, and damaging property. They arrested the leader and those who used force or threats.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors said that a total of 31 people have been arrested or came forward on their own. After questioning, Prosecutors Li Kan-ying, Lin Shih-hsun, Shih Chia-hung, and Liang Yung-chun believed that Mr. Chen was the leader. They thought he might try to connect with other people involved or witnesses. So, they asked the Qiaotou District Court to hold him and not allow him to see visitors. This is for crimes like disturbing order, causing injury, using force, and damaging property. The six people who helped were each given bail of 30,000 to 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars. The others were released without bail.</p>
            <p>The head of the Kaohsiung City Police Department's Criminal Investigation Team, Yan Zhi-hao, said that Mr. Chen used to work at Botian Hospital. The group pretended to be security guards. The police will use the information they have to see the connection between Mr. Chen and the other people present.</p>
            <p>It is understood that Mr. Chen may have paid people between 2,000 and 4,000 New Taiwan Dollars to pretend to be security guards. They then entered the hospital, damaged equipment, and argued with the hospital's security staff.</p>

            <h1>China's Foshan Requires Real-Name Registration to Buy Fever and Joint Pain Medicine to Track Chikungunya</h1>
            <p>In China, the Chikungunya disease is spreading more and more. The number of people confirmed to have the disease is almost 7,000. To help the government find cases and stop the disease from spreading, officials in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, have made an announcement. Foshan is where this outbreak started. From now on, if any drug store in the city sells any of the 47 types of medicines that treat Chikungunya symptoms like fever, skin rash, and joint pain, people must register with their real names.</p>
            <p>The Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper reported that the 47 medicines include well-known ones in China, like Lianhua Qingwen capsules and Banlangen. They also have versions for children.</p>
            <p>This announcement says that starting from August 1st, all drug stores in Foshan City must follow a strict rule. They must record sales of "specially controlled medicines." This rule is part of Foshan City's plan to control the spread of the disease. The 47 medicines that require real-name registration are used to treat symptoms of Chikungunya, such as fever, skin rash, and joint pain.</p>
            <p>The announcement states that when people buy these medicines in drug stores in Foshan City, they need to let the staff scan a code to prove who they are. They also need to fill in their personal information. If they have symptoms like fever, skin rash, or joint pain, or if they have been bitten by mosquitoes recently, they should also tell the drug store staff.</p>
            <p>The announcement also says that for older people or others who cannot use smartphones or register by themselves, their family members should help them. Or, the drug store staff should give them the help they need to complete the registration.</p>
            <p>The announcement also states that drug stores and government departments will "strictly follow national laws about protecting personal information." They will "keep the information collected from people buying medicine very secret." This information will only be used to help control the disease.</p>
            <p>The Chikungunya outbreak has continued to spread, reaching Macau and Hong Kong. On August 2nd, Shen Hongbing, the head of China's National Disease Control and Prevention Administration, went to Foshan. He gave instructions on how to control Chikungunya. He asked them to try hard to stop the outbreak as quickly as possible. This is to make sure people's health is safe and that the "overall social situation is peaceful and stable."</p>
