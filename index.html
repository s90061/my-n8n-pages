            <h1>Hsu Chia-ching Visits STUF Headquarters, Shares NGO and Government Work Experience</h1>
            <p>Overseas Community Affairs Council Minister Hsu Chia-ching visited the headquarters of the STUF United Fund, a non-governmental organization (NGO), in New York today. She shared her experiences working with NGOs and running them. She also talked about her recent visit to Taiwanese communities in Latin America and how deeply she felt about Taiwan's democracy and social progress, which were not easy to achieve.</p>
            <p>The STUF United Fund, made up of Taiwanese businesspeople in North America, is part of the UN Global Compact. It also has a special consulting status with the UN Economic and Social Council (UN-ECOSOC).</p>
            <p>STUF members have always worked on global public health and promoted corporate responsibility. In recent years, they have also focused on training young students from Taiwan and new generations of Taiwanese Americans in North America. This helps continue their important work in international charity and Taiwan's involvement.</p>
            <p>On the 11th, Hsu Chia-ching visited STUF's new headquarters, which opened in Manhattan, New York, in July. She learned about STUF's current main projects and congratulated them on their new home.</p>
            <p>She said that over the past few years, STUF's operations have become clearer. Since 2016, STUF has been a member of the United Nations NGOs. They have tried many new things. Some were difficult, and some went more smoothly. They put in a lot of effort during this time.</p>
            <p>She said, "STUF has big goals around the world. We want to offer different kinds of help and services, just like the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals."</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching, who has experience working with NGOs in Taiwan and internationally, pointed out that NGOs need clear goals to be effective. She said that with limited resources, if an organization tries to do too many things or has too many projects, results will appear slowly or might not happen at all.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching recently visited Taiwanese communities in several South American countries. At the STUF headquarters, near the United Nations, she listened to reports from STUF staff in various US states and new employees. She also shared her feelings about interacting with local people and overseas Taiwanese in Latin America.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching believes that Central and South America have many resources, good weather, and hardworking people. She wonders why their economic and social development has not been very successful. There are big differences in how countries develop. Politics is the main reason for this. She noted that the Americas are the only region in modern times, from north to south, that has not had a large-scale war.</p>
            <p>She stressed that Taiwan has good government and is a developed democracy. This is very difficult to achieve. Everyone must know that they need to work together to reach these goals. Many other countries had to go through bloody revolutions and wars.</p>
            <p>She said, "For decades, Taiwan has gone through political changes and social shifts without paying a high price. We have been able to keep making progress. This is our good luck. But we must keep improving to stay ahead. If we make wrong choices, the results could be completely different."</p>

            <h1>US Naval Academy Receives Threat, Enters Lockdown</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland went into lockdown today because of a threat. The school told teachers, students, and staff to stay where they were. Later, the local state government said there was no real threat.</p>
            <p>News from the U.S. Naval Institute reported this afternoon that a spokesperson for the Naval Academy confirmed that the Annapolis Naval Support Activity, near the academy, was working with local police. They were responding to a threat made against the Naval Academy. The school told teachers, students, and staff to stay in a safe place.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson also said that "the base is locked down" as a safety measure. The situation is still developing, and more information will be given when available.</p>
            <p>Earlier, 11 News reported that a local police spokesperson said, "We cannot confirm a threat right now, but we are searching the area to be very careful."</p>
            <p>Later, 11 News reported that the office of Maryland Governor Wes Moore stated, "After working with local, state, and federal police, there is no real threat to the Naval Academy at this time."</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that before this investigation at the Naval Academy, there were similar threats at universities across the U.S. This included seven historically Black colleges and universities, which also closed or went into lockdown.</p>

            <h1>Belarus Releases 52 Political Prisoners, Lithuanian President Thanks Trump for Mediation</h1>
            <p>Today, Lithuanian President NausÄ—da held an urgent press conference. He announced that Belarus has released 52 political prisoners. These prisoners include people from Lithuania and other countries. They have safely arrived in Lithuania. He thanked former US President Trump for helping with the talks.</p>
            <p>According to LRT, Lithuania's national public broadcaster, those released include opposition figures, journalists, people who took part in anti-government protests, and citizens from different countries.</p>
            <p>Among them, Elena Romanauskiene, a Lithuanian citizen, was also set free. She used to be a marketing manager at a Belarusian sanatorium. Belarus had arrested her, saying she shared visitor information, including about high-ranking Belarusian officials, with people outside.</p>
            <p>Lithuanian President Gitanas NausÄ—da said he worked very hard to get Romanauskiene released. He especially thanked Donald Trump for being involved in the whole process. He also stressed that more than 1,000 political prisoners are still in Belarus. He said they should keep working to free them. He also asked Lithuanian citizens not to travel to Belarus.</p>
            <p>This release was announced today after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko met with John Coale, a high-ranking official from the Trump administration. The list of released prisoners includes 14 foreign citizens. Lukashenko said this happened "at the request of the US President." CNN reported that those released include 6 Lithuanians, 2 Latvians, 2 Poles, 2 Germans, and 1 French and 1 British person.</p>
            <p>CNN quoted US officials who said the United States agreed to partly ease sanctions on Belavia, Belarus's state-owned airline. This would allow the airline to buy parts for Boeing planes. US officials also said that the talks also covered regional safety and Belarus's use of illegal immigrants for political reasons.</p>
            <p>Mikola Statkevich, a well-known opposition leader in Belarus, was also on the list of those released. He ran for president in 2010. After the 2020 election, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for protesting. The human rights group Viasna said that no one has known about his condition since early 2023.</p>
            <p>TASS, a Russian state-owned news agency, reported that this pardon was "for humanitarian reasons" and a "gesture of goodwill." It was in response to calls from Trump and other world leaders.</p>
            <p>NausÄ—da stressed that this action is not connected to removing or making Western sanctions on Belarus less strict. However, he admitted that this is "positive news in a difficult time" for the region.</p>
