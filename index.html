            <h1>Germany's Border Checks Cost 80 Million Euros, Most Spent on Police Overtime</h1>
            <p>Germany started checking all its borders in September last year. New information from the government shows that by the end of June this year, this had cost about 80.5 million Euros (about 2.8 billion Taiwan dollars). Most of this money was for federal police overtime. People say this is expensive and not effective.</p>
            <p>Germany restarted full land border checks in mid-September last year. A government report says that from then until June this year, Germany spent 80.5 million Euros. The largest part of this was 37.9 million Euros (about 1.3 billion Taiwan dollars) for federal police overtime.</p>
            <p>The report also shows that extra costs for federal police at the border are about 24 to 29.1 million Euros each quarter. From April to June 2025 alone, the government spent about 8 million Euros on food and lodging for police officers. Nearly 3 million Euros were for special shift payments. Equipment cost 2.6 million Euros, and running border checkpoints cost almost 2 million Euros.</p>
            <p>Around 14,000 federal police officers are now working at the borders. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said last week that they will continue the land border checks, which were planned for one year, and add rules for sending people back. This has caused doubts and disagreement in Germany.</p>
            <p>Marcel Emmerich, the Green Party's speaker for interior affairs in parliament, said, "Tens of thousands of federal police officers are sent to the border for these illegal and useless measures. This means there are not enough police at train stations and airports." He added that this makes things difficult for people who travel for work or holidays.</p>
            <p>The Police Union (GdP) said that the full border checks make police work "very hard." Andreas RoÃŸkopf, the union's head, said that as border and immigration rules become stricter, police units across the country keep changing their work schedules. Because there are not enough police, many officers have to miss their planned training and further education.</p>
            <p>Last year, there were many knife attacks and car attacks in Germany. The far-right AfD party used this to criticize the government's rules on refugees and immigrants. This helped the AfD gain a lot of support and become the biggest party in many German states.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Friedrich Merz, during the parliamentary elections in February this year, made border control and stricter immigration one of his main promises. After he took office in May, he continued to make border checks stronger. His goal is to stop the AfD from getting stronger because of immigration and refugee issues, and to reduce extreme right-wing and anti-foreigner feelings in society.</p>

            <h1>Resilience Special Act Amended: Budget Increased to 590 Billion, Cash Payments for Everyone Without Income Limits</h1>
            <p>On August 14, the Executive Yuan approved a plan to change the "Special Act for Resilience." This plan will raise the money limit to 590 billion New Taiwan Dollars. It will also set the time for giving out cash to everyone and add 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars for running the program. Plus, it will add 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars to make electricity stronger and 4 billion New Taiwan Dollars to help people who are struggling. This plan will now go to the Legislative Yuan for them to look at. The cash payments will start within one month after the special budget is made public and will be given out over seven months. The government said that because lawmakers from different parties asked for it, and because of new import taxes and natural disasters, they decided to give cash to everyone without checking how much money they earn. They will also give more help to people in need. If all parties in politics agree, the money might be given out in September.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Putin are Confident and Good at Negotiating, Ukraine's Peace Fate Undecided</h1>
            <p>The leaders of the US and Russia will meet in Alaska to talk about peace in Ukraine. US news sources say that the issue of Ukraine's land is the main point of the talk. Putin is confident because the Russian army is moving forward, so he can suggest things to Trump. Trump wants to be a peacemaker. But people are worried if the two leaders will make secret deals when they are alone.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet on August 15 in Anchorage, Alaska. This place is only 90 kilometers from Russian land, so the meeting is very important for history.</p>
            <p>In 1867, the US and Russia signed an agreement in Washington. Russia agreed to sell Alaska to the US for 7.2 million dollars. Now, Putin, as president, will visit US land that used to be Russia's more than 150 years ago. They will talk about ending the war in Ukraine, but the leader of Ukraine, the country that was attacked, will not be at the talks.</p>
            <p>Everyone is wondering if the meeting will achieve anything. If they do agree on something, how will Ukraine and Europe deal with it in the future? Trump plans to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after his talk with Putin.</p>
            <p>Russia attacked Ukraine in the spring of 2022. The Ukrainian army fought hard with military help from the US and Europe. The Russian army could not win quickly as they planned, and their economy and money were badly affected. But as the war continued, help from the US and Europe slowed down. Russia kept selling energy to India, China, and some European countries, so its economy became stable. Russia also called for more soldiers, and the Ukrainian army started to be in a worse position.</p>
            <p>Russian forces have taken almost all of Lugansk in eastern Ukraine. They also control most of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. They have also connected these areas to Crimea, which they took in 2014. From this, it is very clear what Putin's plan is.</p>
            <p>Putin wants to connect Russian land from inland to the Black Sea. He wants to get the Kherson area's port to the sea. This would leave Ukraine with a very short coastline, which would greatly reduce its economic growth and important position.</p>
            <p>The New York Times said that Putin is confident because the Russian army is getting strong again on the battlefield. At first, the Russian army did not have enough equipment and was confused, so the Ukrainian army hurt them badly. Putin used all of Russia's power to change the army and the country's economy. He got more soldiers, made more weapons, and changed battle plans at the front line. His only goal was to defeat the Ukrainian army.</p>
            <p>Now, the war is going well for Russia. Russia's soldiers and equipment are more than what Ukraine has, even with all the help from Western countries. Russian soldiers continue to be injured or die, but they are still moving west. The front line is now 1200 kilometers long. This allows Putin to fight until he gets a peace agreement on his own terms.</p>
            <p>Trump wants to be a "peacemaker" and win a Nobel Peace Prize for his time as president. However, the White House has been lowering expectations for the meeting, which is unusual. Trump said he believes he can make a deal with Putin, but there is still a 25% chance it will fail.</p>
            <p>Putin's goal is very clear: to make other countries accept and agree that Russia has taken Ukrainian land. Being on the world stage helps him be seen more. People are worried that Trump will be alone with Putin, who is also good at negotiating. They are concerned that secret deals might be made.</p>
