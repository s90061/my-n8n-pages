            <h1>Kaohsiung Fishing Boat Loses Power and Drifts, Penghu and Tainan Coast Guard Aid Safe Return</h1>
            <p>A fishing boat from Kaohsiung, named "Hong San He," had a problem with its engine. It lost power and started to drift in the sea near Qimei, Penghu, today. The Coast Guard teams from Penghu and Tainan came to help. They worked together to fix the boat and safely brought it back to port. All four people on the boat were safe.</p>
            <p>The 13th Patrol Area Command Center of the Coast Guard got a call at about 1:10 PM today. They were told that the "Hong San He" fishing boat, with four Taiwanese crew members, was about 23 nautical miles (about 42.6 kilometers) southwest of Qimei. The boat's engine had stopped working. The command center quickly told the Penghu Coast Guard team to send a boat to help. They also asked the Tainan Coast Guard team to send a patrol boat to assist.</p>
            <p>The Penghu Coast Guard team arrived at the area where the boat was at 4:06 PM and met the "Hong San He." When they got on the boat, they found that the boat's battery was dead, so it could not start. After 30 minutes of fixing the problem, the "Hong San He" boat started working again. The Tainan patrol boat then guided the "Hong San He" back to port. The boat captain thanked the Coast Guard for their quick help.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard asks all boaters to check their boats carefully before going out to sea. This helps make sure everyone is safe. If you have an accident at sea, you can call the Coast Guard's free emergency number "118" or tell a fishing radio station. The Coast Guard will come to help right away to keep people and their property safe.</p>

            <h1>Peng Jin-lung: Banks Should Tell Customers After Freezing Accounts and Restore Them Quickly</h1>
            <p>Recently, some banks have been freezing people's accounts without telling them first. They do this to fight against fraud. But this has made some people unhappy because their accounts are frozen without warning. Peng Jin-lung, the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), said today that banks should tell customers after they freeze an account. He also said that banks should help customers get their accounts working normally again very quickly.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung led a regular meeting with reporters today and answered their questions.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked if banks should tell customers when they freeze an account. Peng Jin-lung said that the FSC is very careful about fraud. He explained that banks are also victims of fraud, not people who cause it. So, the FSC must support banks in their efforts to stop fraud.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung said that the FSC will not stop its work to prevent fraud. He said that if they stop, it would help the scammers. The FSC's goal to stop fraud will not change, but they will always change and improve their methods. They are happy to hear suggestions and are making many plans to deal with these issues. For example, they recently asked the Bankers Association to create a "Committee to Prevent Financial Fraud."</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung also said that the FSC will not tell everyone exactly how banks freeze accounts or why some accounts are frozen. This is because scammers might use this information. But, if a bank freezes an account in a bad way, the FSC will ask the bank to improve right away.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung has seen that the number of "warning accounts" (accounts that might be used for fraud) is now going down. This means that more banks are finding good ways to make it harder and more expensive for scammers to use financial services. He said, "We will not give up. We will continue to work, and we will keep making our methods better." This includes making fraud prevention more precise.</p>
            <p>Regarding how accounts are frozen, Peng Jin-lung explained that there are already rules about how much information to give. He said it is not good to tell people beforehand that their account will be frozen. But after an account is frozen, banks should use different ways to help people get their accounts back to normal as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jia-kui, a deputy director from the Banking Bureau, added that if an account still needs to be watched, banks should tell the customer in a proper way. This should be done without stopping the bank's ability to control the account. Also, for accounts that are controlled, banks should provide a quick way for customers to complain and get help.</p>
