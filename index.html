            <h1>Elderly Man in Taichung's Shigang Area Unhurt After Car Rolls Off Road</h1>
            <p>An 87-year-old man named Mr. Chuang was driving his car yesterday near number 126, Shihgang Street, Shihgang Lane, in Taichung City's Shihgang District. He might not have known the road well, and the road was narrow. As he drove there, his car accidentally slipped off the side of the road and overturned. The driver was able to climb out of the car by himself and was not hurt.</p>
            <p>Today, the Dongshi Police Station in Taichung City released a statement. It said that yesterday at about 9:29 AM, a small car at number 126, Shihgang Street, Shihgang Lane, in Shihgang District, slipped off the road and overturned. This happened because the road was narrow and the driver did not know the road well. The driver got out of the car on his own and was lucky not to be hurt.</p>
            <p>Police did a first check at the scene. They found that the driver of the small car was 87-year-old Mr. Chuang. He was driving alone at the time of the accident. There were no traffic lights or signs, and the road markings were normal. Also, there was no construction happening. Mr. Chuang had not been drinking and was not injured. The police finished their work and recorded the details at the scene.</p>
            <p>Wu Yung-hsin, the head of the Shihgang police office at Dongshi Police Station, reminded people that roads in the mountains are narrow and winding. Drivers should slow down when they are on roads they do not know well. They should also pay attention to the road conditions to avoid accidents.</p>

            <p>The Weather Bureau said that today, most parts of Taiwan will be cloudy to sunny. There will be afternoon thunderstorms in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area and in all mountain areas. Also, it will be very hot all over Taiwan. Temperatures in the eastern part of the island will be about 31 to 33 degrees Celsius. In the western part, temperatures can reach 34 or 35 degrees Celsius. People in Greater Taipei and near the mountains in central and southern Taiwan should be careful of temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau said that there is still less moisture in the air today. So, most places will be cloudy to sunny. Only the Taitung area and the Hengchun Peninsula will have a few short rain showers. In the afternoon, the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area and other mountain areas will have some short thunderstorms. People in the mountains should be careful of falling rocks, loose soil, and parts of the land falling down. If you go to the mountains or rivers, please be safe.</p>
            <p>About temperatures, the eastern part of Taiwan will have high temperatures of about 31 to 33 degrees. The western part can reach 34 or 35 degrees Celsius. Especially in Greater Taipei and near the mountains in central and southern Taiwan, there is a chance of temperatures going above 36 degrees Celsius. The sun's UV rays will be strong around noon. Remember to put on sunscreen and drink a lot of water. For the smaller islands, Penghu will be 26 to 30 degrees, Kinmen 27 to 33 degrees, and Matsu 27 to 31 degrees.</p>
            <p>The Weather Bureau also said that the tropical depression that was near Guam became the 11th typhoon, called Podul (Yang Liu), at 2 AM today.

            <h1>Typhoon Podul Will Affect Taiwan Most From August 13th; Sea Warning Possible</h1>
            <p>The Weather Bureau has announced that a typhoon has formed. The tropical depression that was north-northeast of Guam became a mild typhoon at 2 AM. It is the 11th typhoon and is named Podul. After August 12, it will slowly get closer to the sea southeast of Taiwan. It will affect Taiwan most on August 13 and 14. A sea warning might be issued.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau said that the tropical depression, which was north-northeast of Guam, became a mild typhoon named Podul at 2 AM. The center of the typhoon is 2660 kilometers east of Eluanbi. It is expected to move west.</p>
            <p>A weather forecaster, Tseng Chao-cheng, told CNA reporters that Typhoon Podul will get closer to the sea southeast of Taiwan after August 12. The time it will affect Taiwan the most is on August 13 and 14. The eastern part of Taiwan will have a lot of rain.</p>
            <p>Tseng Chao-cheng also reminded everyone that they need to watch if the typhoon moves closer to Taiwan or the Bashi Channel, because the effect on Taiwan will be different. If the typhoon gets very close to the sea east of Taiwan, a sea typhoon warning might be issued. But right now, there is still a lot of uncertainty about its path.</p>
