            <h1>Trump: US wants to take back Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan</h1>
            <p>Today, former US President Donald Trump said that the United States is trying to get back Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. He also criticized how the government of former President Joe Biden pulled troops out of Afghanistan in 2021, calling it messy.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump spoke at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump said the US gave up the base for no good reason. He added, "We are trying to get it back."</p>
            <p>Trump has often said that Bagram Air Base is important because it is near the border between Afghanistan and China. Earlier this month, he also said that Biden's government was "very foolish" for taking US troops out of the base in 2021.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Trump also said at today's press conference that one reason the US wants the base back is because it's only "an hour" away from where China makes nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump also suggested that he might use the US government's power to get Bagram Air Base back from the Taliban, who now control Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters, "We are trying to get the base back because they need things from us. We want to get that base back."</p>

            <h1>UK plans to recognize Palestine, Trump disagrees with Starmer</h1>
            <p>After discussing the war in Gaza, former US President Donald Trump said today that he does not agree with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This is about Britain's plan to recognize Palestine as a country.</p>
            <p>On his second day visiting the UK, Trump held a press conference with Starmer at Chequers Court, the Prime Minister's country home. Trump said, "I disagree with the Prime Minister on this point. It is one of the few things we do not agree on."</p>
            <p>In July, Starmer announced that Britain would try to recognize Palestine at the UN General Assembly in September. This would happen if Israel did not agree to a ceasefire in Gaza and other conditions.</p>
            <p>At today's press conference, Starmer and Trump mostly showed they agreed, except for a few issues like the Palestinian state.</p>
            <p>France, Canada, and other Western allies plan to act at the UN next week. However, the United States has strongly said no to countries recognizing Palestine.</p>
            <p>Starmer said they also talked about the worsening situation in Gaza. Both agreed that "peace must be put in place and clear steps planned."</p>
            <p>Trump, for his part, said, "I want this war to end, and I want the hostages to be freed."</p>
            <p>Trump called the Gaza conflict "a complex situation." But when reporters asked many times if he would tell his friend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to stop bombing Gaza, Trump did not answer directly.</p>
            <p>Starmer said the current situation in Gaza is "unacceptable." He also said that "foreign aid must get into Gaza more quickly."</p>
            <p>He added that recognizing Palestine should be part of a bigger "peace plan." This plan would also make sure that the Palestinian group Hamas cannot be part of a new government. However, Starmer did not say exactly when Britain would officially recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>British media said today that Starmer might finish his plan to recognize Palestine as early as this weekend, before the UN summit starts.</p>

            <h1>Ukrainian forces start new attack in the east, take back 7 villages and capture 100 Russian soldiers</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian troops have started a new attack in the east. They have successfully taken back 7 villages and over 160 square kilometers of land. They have also stopped several attack plans by Russian forces in the Donetsk region.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy shared on social media that the attacks are mainly happening around Pokrovsk and Dobropillia in the Donetsk region. The fighting there is very strong. According to a report from the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, more than 100 Russian soldiers have been captured since the attack started. Also, over 1300 Russian soldiers have died in the Pokrovsk area.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy recently went to the front lines in the eastern Donetsk region to see the troops. He said that Ukrainian forces have made it harder for Russian forces to start a big attack there. He also asked other countries to put more restrictions on Russia. This would help Ukraine use its military power and long-range weapons to make Russia agree to peace.</p>
            <p>Between July and August, Russian forces increased their attacks on places like Pokrovsk, Dobropillia, and Myrnohrad. The American think tank, "Institute for the Study of War" (ISW), said that on August 12, Russian forces took about 110 square kilometers of land in one day. This was their biggest gain in over a year.</p>
            <p>However, last week, Ukraine's Azov Regiment released a video. It showed them capturing 17 Russian soldiers near Dobropillia. They also announced that, with other units, they had captured a total of 69 soldiers. Public information shows that Russian attacks have slowed down recently.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Zelenskyy warned in an interview with Sky News from the UK that Russia is getting ready for two big attacks.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also mentioned that US officials said Russian President Vladimir Putin told Washington that he plans to take full control of the entire Donbas region in 2 to 3 months.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's last big public attack was in the summer of 2023. At that time, they tried to cut off Russia's land supply route from the southeast to Crimea, but they did not succeed. Some people thought that Ukraine promoted their attack too much and did not realize how ready Russia was to defend, which made the attack fail.</p>
            <p>After that, Ukrainian forces were often in a weaker position on the front lines. The government rarely used the word "counter-offensive" again. In 2024, Ukrainian forces made a surprise attack on Russia's Kursk region, which again got international attention. But the situation in eastern Ukraine is still difficult, and Russian forces have taken several places.</p>
