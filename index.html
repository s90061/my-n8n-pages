New research shows that young people, especially those aged 16 to 24 (Generation Z), are experiencing high levels of loneliness and anxiety. A study conducted by BBC Radio 4, Tideswell, and Ipsos UK found that over half of this age group feels lonely, and a similar number report feeling anxious. These numbers are higher compared to older generations. Experts are looking at why this is happening. Social media plays a mixed role; some young people use it to connect with others, but for many, it causes pressure and comparison. Other factors contributing to these feelings include the effects of the pandemic and worries about global issues like climate change. The findings suggest there is a strong need for better mental health support for young people, especially in schools and universities.

**The Future of Work: Focusing on Human Skills in the Age of AI**

Discussions at the World Economic Forum have highlighted how artificial intelligence (AI) will transform the workplace. Experts suggest that while AI will change many jobs, it will not necessarily replace humans entirely. Instead, there will be a greater need for uniquely human skills, such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. People will need to learn new skills throughout their careers to adapt to these changes. Companies are encouraged to invest in training their employees to ensure they are ready for future roles that might involve working closely with AI tools. The idea is that humans and AI will collaborate, with AI handling repetitive tasks and people focusing on problem-solving and innovation. This shift means that future jobs will likely be more human-focused, valuing our unique abilities.

**Venice Introduces New Fee for Day Tourists to Control Crowds**

The popular Italian city of Venice has started charging a new entry fee for day visitors. From April 25, 2024, people visiting for just one day on certain busy dates must pay 5 euros. This new rule aims to help manage the large number of tourists and protect the historic city. Venice is the first major city in the world to introduce such a fee. Tourists who plan to stay overnight in Venice do not have to pay this charge. Visitors affected by the fee need to book their visit online and receive a special QR code before they arrive. Those who do not pay the fee could face fines. This new system is currently a trial, and city officials will decide if it should continue or expand in the future.
