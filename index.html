            <h1>Financial Times: US and Europe Close to Reaching Tariff Agreement, 15% Rate</h1>
            <p>The Financial Times reported today that the European Union (EU) and the United States are close to making a trade agreement. This agreement will put a 15% tax on goods coming into Europe. This is similar to the agreement US President Trump made with Japan this week.</p>
            <p>Three people who know about the talks told the Financial Times that EU officials might agree to these "matching tariffs." This is to avoid the tariffs Trump threatened. He said he would raise tariffs on EU goods to 30% starting from August 1st.</p>
            <p>An EU diplomat said, "Most member countries are quietly accepting this and will probably agree to the deal."</p>
            <p>The same sources said that some products will not have these tariffs, including airplanes, alcoholic drinks, and medical equipment.</p>
            <p>Two of the sources also said that the agreement between the US and Japan made EU officials feel they had to accept the higher matching tariff rate. They did this to avoid a harmful trade war.</p>
            <p>The report says that if Trump tries to push harder, or if he raises the matching tariffs to 30% from August as he threatened, the EU might still react strongly.</p>

            <h1>Trump Government Announces New AI Plan to Make US Leadership Stronger and Compete with China</h1>
            <p>The US Trump government today announced a new plan for Artificial Intelligence (AI). This plan is very ambitious and wants fewer rules. It hopes to help big technology companies stay ahead of China in AI and make America's lead strong in this fast-growing area.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that this 25-page "America's AI Action Plan" has three main goals: to make new ideas happen faster, to build necessary systems, and to lead AI development around the world.</p>
            <p>This plan sees AI growth as key to keeping economic and military power. However, the plan does not focus much on how AI affects the environment.</p>
            <p>David Sacks, who is the White House "AI and Cryptocurrency Czar," told the media, "We believe we are in an AI race... and we want the United States to win this race."</p>
            <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce this plan in a speech later today.</p>
            <p>According to US media, Trump is also expected to announce several official orders. These orders will make important parts of this plan law.</p>
            <p>This plan brings together over 90 government ideas. It also asks for many fewer rules. The Trump government also promised to "remove complex government steps and difficult rules" so they do not stop private companies from making AI.</p>

            <h1>VP: Donating Canvas was Criticized as Political Interference in Schools; "Fighting for Hualien People's Dignity"</h1>
            <p>When Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim ran for Hualien legislator in 2016, she gave large canvas banners to schools. The Hualien County Government said this was politics getting involved in schools. Last night, she said she felt many emotions about this old event. She now understands she was never alone, and many Hualien citizens are still working hard for Hualien. She said, "Let's fight for the Hualien people's dignity, keep going!"</p>
            <p>The Liberty Times reported yesterday that Hualien County Councilor Hu Ren-shun from the Democratic Progressive Party said that Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, when running for legislator in Hualien in 2016, gave large campaign banners she had used to schools. But the Hualien County Government blamed her, saying it was "political power getting into schools."</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao posted on Threads late last night. She said she had just seen this news and felt many emotions; it was an old story. This happened after the 2016 election. At that time, her simple and good idea to reuse materials caused problems for the schools. She felt a bit sad and upset then. But looking back, she realized this was normal during her many years working in Hualien.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that she learned a lot from going through this difficult period and working hard. Her own life has now moved to a different chapter.</p>
            <p>The Vice President also said that the old banners had her picture on them, looking like she was "eating dirt" (meaning working hard). They also said, "Fighting for the Hualien people's dignity." Now, she understands that she was never alone. This is because many Hualien citizens "are still working hard for their hometown and fighting for a better Hualien. Keep going!"</p>
