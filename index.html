            <h1>Fake Line Account of County Mayor Hsu Chen-Wei Scams People to Join Investment Groups; Hualien Police Investigate</h1>
            <p>Hualien police have received many reports from people. They got Line messages from an account pretending to be County Mayor Hsu Chen-Wei. This account invited them to join a "County Mayor's Exclusive Investment Group." The Hualien County Police Department has started an investigation. So far, no one has been scammed. Police ask people to be careful and recognize these scam methods.</p>
            <p>People told the police that they received a friend request on Line from someone calling themselves "Hsu Chen-Wei." At first, the account sent good morning messages and asked how they were. Later, it invited them to join "County Mayor's Exclusive Investment Group" or "Internal Project Financial Group." It said they could get special information and promised high profits.</p>
            <p>Some people who added the account also received messages where the "County Mayor" asked about their work. The "County Mayor" also asked them to "go and learn about the supervisor's policy to help poor people." In the end, all conversations led to an invitation to join an investment group.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government quickly clarified today that the account was fake and pretending to be the County Mayor. The County Mayor does not add people on Line, invite them to invest, ask for their bank details, or ask for donations. They urge people to be careful.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Police Department also released a statement. It said that after receiving the reports, they started an investigation. Currently, no one has reported being scammed. Scam groups use photos and names of well-known people to create fake accounts. If you think something might be a scam, you should stop talking to them immediately. Call the 165 anti-scam hotline or ask the police for help.</p>

            <h1>Study: Pollution or Environmental Changes May Cause Australian Birds to Change Gender</h1>
            <p>A study from an Australian university found a surprising number of wild birds in Australia are changing their gender. Scientists believe this might be due to more pollution or other things in the environment.</p>
            <p>AFP reported on a study that looked at 5 common Australian birds: kookaburras, magpies, and lorikeets. It found that about 6% of these birds had chromosomes of one gender, but their reproductive organs were of the other gender.</p>
            <p>Researchers from the University of Sunshine Coast, Australia, said the results showed that more birds than expected changed gender after they were born.</p>
            <p>Dominique Potvin, one of the researchers, said: "This shows that the way gender is decided in wild birds is more flexible than we thought. This change can even continue when they become adult birds."</p>
            <p>The study checked the DNA of almost 500 birds. Most of the birds that changed gender were genetically female but developed male reproductive organs.</p>
            <p>Potvin also said, "We found one kookaburra that was genetically male but had active female reproductive organs. It had large follicles and swollen oviducts. This means it recently laid eggs."</p>
            <p>Gender change is well-known in some reptiles and fish. However, it is very rare in wild birds and mammals.</p>
            <p>Scientists have already found that pollutants and even warm temperatures can cause frogs to change gender.</p>
            <p>The University of Sunshine Coast study stated that the reason for gender change in wild birds is not yet clear. But it might be related to environmental factors. For example, chemicals that affect hormones might build up in wild areas.</p>
            <p>Potvin added, "Understanding how gender change happens and why it happens is very important for protecting birds. It also helps to make bird research more accurate."</p>
            <p>This study was published this week in "Biology Letters," which is a science journal reviewed by other experts.</p>

            <h1>Criminal Investigation Bureau Busts "Lineage" Private Server; It Made NT$5 Billion in 15 Years</h1>
            <p>The Criminal Investigation Bureau found a group of four people, led by a person named Cai, and criminals in China. They illegally copied the famous game "Lineage." They set up a private game server called "Hanjin Lineage."</p>
            <p>It is believed that they made NT$5 billion (about US$160 million) in 15 years. Thousands of players connected to it every day. The police are now dealing with the case for breaking copyright laws and other related crimes.</p>
            <p>The Intellectual Property Rights Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigation Bureau recently received a report. It was from Gamania Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd. They said that their famous game brand "Lineage" had its game content, items, and trademarks illegally copied by the "Hanjin Lineage" private server.</p>
            <p>The private server showed the trademarks "Gamania Digital Entertainment," the original Korean company, and "Lineage" at the start of the game. The game content and the screen also looked exactly the same. This seriously broke Gamania Digital Entertainment's copyright and trademark rights.</p>
            <p>After getting the report, the Criminal Investigation Bureau, together with police from New Taipei, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, created a special team. They worked under the direction of the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office.</p>
            <p>After one year of searching, the team found that the group was led by Cai and three other people in Taiwan. They set up the private game server in a computer room in Xinzhuang. Criminals in China provided technical support and managed the server from far away. They sold virtual items to make illegal money.</p>
            <p>The Intellectual Property Rights Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigation Bureau held a press conference today. They announced that "Hanjin Lineage" operated from 2010 until March of this year. Thousands of players connected to it every day.</p>
            <p>After collecting all the evidence, they carried out two search operations. These took place on March 27 and May 14 this year in Kaohsiung City, Taipei City, and New Taipei City. They arrested Cai and three others. They seized 6 "Hanjin Lineage" server main computers, over NT$1.15 million in cash, and many other pieces of evidence. The estimated value of the copyright infringement is NT$5 billion. The case has been sent to the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office for breaking copyright law and trademark law.</p>
