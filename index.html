            <h1>Polish and Taiwanese lawmakers support Taiwan; Lin Chia-lung hopes to build a democratic supply chain without China.</h1>
            <p>Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung went to an event for the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group" in Poland today. More than 20 senators and representatives from different political parties in Poland were there. This showed their strong support for Taiwan. Lin Chia-lung said that Taiwan will work with Poland and other similar European countries to make their democracies stronger. He also hopes to work with Poland to create a strong supply chain that is democratic and not controlled by China.</p>
            <p>Many important people attended the event. These included Michal Kaminski, who is the Deputy Speaker of the Polish Senate, Krzysztof Truskolaski, who leads the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group," Beata MaÅ‚ecka-Libera, who is a deputy leader, and MichaÅ‚ Gramatyka, who is also a deputy leader and a deputy minister for digital affairs. It was special because more than 20 members came from different places to Warsaw for the event, even though the parliament was not meeting.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung spoke at the event. He said that Taiwan and Poland are good partners because they share similar ideas. He thanked the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group" for their statement in April. This statement supported Taiwan's involvement in international groups and keeping peace in the Taiwan Strait. It also used a European Parliament decision to say that China wrongly understands UN Resolution 2758. The statement made it clear that this resolution does not mention Taiwan and does not decide anything about Taiwan's status.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung also said that Taiwan believes in freedom and democracy. Taiwan also helps the world through working together in business and technology. Taiwan will continue to use its "total diplomacy" to make democracies stronger with European partners like Poland. This will create a strong friendship based on shared values.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung mentioned that Taiwan and Poland have made good progress in trade this year. Michal Jaros, who is the Deputy Minister of Economy and Technology in Poland, has visited Taiwan twice with large groups. This shows that Poland really wants to make trade stronger between the two countries. In June this year, Taiwan said it would allow fresh blueberries from Poland to be sold in Taiwan. This will help Polish farmers and Taiwanese buyers. Also, Taiwan and Poland can work together well in areas like artificial intelligence (AI), drones, advanced computer chips, and defense. They hope to work together to build a strong, democratic supply chain that is not influenced by China.</p>
            <p>Michal Kaminski, the Deputy Speaker of the Polish Senate, said that Taiwan and Poland will fight against the rule of China and Russia because both countries believe in freedom and democracy. He said that the two countries are the best partners and the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group" will keep working hard to make their relationship better.</p>
            <p>Krzysztof Truskolaski, the leader of the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group," welcomed Lin Chia-lung back to Poland. He said that this group has the most members of any group in the Polish parliament that focuses on two countries. This shows that many politicians in Poland from different parties strongly support Taiwan. The group will continue to support Taiwan's involvement in global organizations and peace in the Taiwan Strait. They will also show their strong support for Taiwan with real actions. They will also help make working together better in trade, science, culture, and other areas.</p>
            <p>Beata MaÅ‚ecka-Libera, who is also a deputy leader of the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group," said that she has been part of the group that supports Taiwan in the Polish Parliament for 16 years. She also said that Lin Chia-lung's visit to the Warsaw Security Forum shows that the connection between them is getting stronger.</p>

            <h1>US military leaders from all over the world met. Trump said America is fighting a "war from within."</h1>
            <p>Today, hundreds of military leaders from different places around the world met in Virginia, USA. This was a rare meeting. President Trump told these leaders that America is facing a "war from inside the country."</p>
            <p>News agencies like AFP and The Hill reported that Trump spoke to the US military leaders at the meeting in Quantico, Virginia. He said, "Together, we bring out the fighting spirit. This spirit has won wars and built this country."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "In the next few years, we will work together to make our military stronger, tougher, faster, braver, and better at fighting than ever before."</p>
            <p>He also pointed out that using the National Guard in several American cities to stop problems was important work for some people there. He said this was also a war, a war from inside the country.</p>
            <p>Trump also told the US military leaders that if Hamas, a Palestinian group, does not agree to a peace deal for Gaza, they will face serious problems.</p>
