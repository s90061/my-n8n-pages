Smartphones are everywhere now, and most people use them a lot every day. But some people are starting to feel tired of always being connected. They are looking for simpler ways to live. Because of this, a small number of people are choosing to go back to using "dumb phones" or "feature phones." These are basic phones that can only make calls and send texts. They don't have internet or social media apps.

This choice is part of a bigger trend. People want to spend less time looking at screens and more time on other activities. They hope that using a simpler phone will help them focus better and feel less stressed. Companies are noticing this, and some are making new versions of these basic phones. While smartphones will still be popular, there is a growing interest in technology that helps people live more simply and mindfully.

**Hybrid Work Shifts Power to Employees**

The way we work has changed a lot since the pandemic. Many companies now allow "hybrid work," which means employees work sometimes from home and sometimes from the office. This new way of working has given more power to employees. Before, companies usually decided everything about where and when people worked. Now, employees often have more say in their schedules and work location.

This shift means that companies need to be more flexible if they want to keep their best workers. If a company demands that everyone come back to the office full-time, its employees might look for jobs at other companies that offer more freedom. This is especially true for younger workers who value flexibility. While some businesses are trying to get everyone back to the office, the trend shows that employees now expect more control over their work-life balance.

**Europe Fights Back Against Overtourism**

Many beautiful cities and natural places in Europe are facing a big problem: "overtourism." This means too many tourists are visiting at once, which can harm the environment, stress local people, and make the visitor experience worse. Popular places like Venice, Amsterdam, and Santorini are now trying to manage this issue.

Local governments are starting to make new rules. For example, some places are limiting the number of cruise ships or making tourists pay a special entry fee. Others are promoting travel to less-known areas or encouraging visitors to come during quieter times of the year. The goal is to protect these popular destinations and make sure that tourism can continue in a way that benefits everyone, not just the tourists.
