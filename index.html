            <h1>AI Net Zero / Xinmo Screws challenges carbon reduction upgrade; integrating supply chain with digital management.</h1>
            <p>Digital change is happening now in industries. Artificial intelligence (AI) and reducing carbon emissions to zero are two big challenges for governments and businesses. These challenges are important for Taiwan's future success. Our news team reported on how the government and different industries are using AI to make production better and create new green ideas. We saw Taiwan's industries improve again.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is the third largest country that sells metal fasteners in the world. It is known as the "Kingdom of Screws." In recent years, companies have faced big challenges. Xinmo Screws Company, located in Gangshan District, Kaohsiung City, is working hard to enter the market for custom-made products. It has also started using digital management for manufacturing. This helps to connect suppliers and buyers, making the industry reduce carbon and improve.</p>
            <p>The "Screw Valley" could not handle the big changes. Some companies had to close down.</p>
            <p>More than half of Taiwan's metal fastener factories are in the south. In the areas of Gangshan and Luzhu in Kaohsiung, many fastener companies are grouped together. This area has a complete supply chain and is known as the "Screw Valley." But recently, due to changing prices of raw materials around the world and cheap competition from places like China, some smaller companies have closed.</p>
            <p>Xinmo Screws, started in 1990, is working hard to change. The company invested money to build new factories and brought in ideas for automation and digital management. At first glance, the factory looks similar to other screw factories. But if you watch the production line for a while, you will see fewer workers. Also, the machines work in a very organized way.</p>
            <p>Guo Ying-cheng, the general manager of Xinmo Screws, took our reporter to the production line. He pointed to a screen on a machine and said that the new machines work much faster and make better products. Also, with extra sensors connected to the internet, workers can watch many machines at the same time. If a machine has a problem, a red light shows immediately. This means workers do not need to check each machine one by one, and fewer people are needed on site.</p>
            <p>Guo Ying-cheng said that Xinmo Screws mainly sells its products to Europe and America. For more than 30 years since the company started, the price of fasteners in the market has kept going down. But costs like staff salaries and electricity have kept going up. It is hard to succeed in the market for standard products when competitors like China have lower production costs.</p>
            <p>Industry upgrade and change: giving up the "red ocean" price war.</p>
            <p>Guo Ying-cheng said, "Only through automation and industry improvement can we avoid a bad cycle of price competition." He noted that in recent years, some smaller companies have decided to close. To reduce the effects of rising costs and not enough workers, Xinmo Screws has slowly stopped fighting price wars with competitors for standard products. Instead, the company is focusing on making its research and development stronger and growing its business in the market for special, custom-made products, where there is high demand.</p>
            <p>He said that besides updating machines and making production management more automatic, the company also uses a "special mold for special product" method. This means one mold only makes one type of product. This improves the quality of products and reduces carbon emissions from wasted materials. At the same time, the company is actively looking for ways to work with government groups and schools. They want to push for digital change and keep up with the global trend of reducing carbon emissions. This will make their products more competitive around the world.</p>
            <p>With help from the Industrial Development Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Xinmo Screws is making its management more efficient and working towards zero carbon emissions. By making production processes better, they use less electricity. This has successfully lowered their yearly carbon emissions by about 3%. They also put money into a system that handles waste oil. This saves money on sending waste oil out for treatment. It has also made the factory area better. They are planning ahead for green manufacturing.</p>
            <p>Xinmo Screws also joined the Industrial Development Administration's digital manufacturing management program and the "Green Gold Industry Shining Value-added Program." They use AI to guess how much product is needed. They have started using a smart manufacturing display system and built a smart teamwork and tracking platform. This helps them check how well their machines are working. They also built a system to track fastener information. This system connects real-time information from all suppliers. By combining automatic production management and efficient methods, they can make production schedules even better. This helps solve problems like too much stock and production taking too long.</p>
            <p>Guo Jun-ting, the special assistant to the general manager of Xinmo Screws, said that the company works with partner companies to make their processes better. They share information on a cloud platform. This reduces repeated office work at each step. This not only makes production more efficient and helps sell products faster, but also, after they started checking processes, the time it takes to make things got shorter by about 20%. From when raw materials arrive until products are sent out, everything can be managed using data.</p>
            <p>Guo Jun-ting said that when the government helps high-tech electronics companies improve their industries, the work processes in each factory are quite similar. Often, one plan can be changed a little bit and used for many companies. This means that electronics companies are usually better at getting government help than traditional industries.</p>
            <p>He said that for traditional industries, especially metal processing factories, there are many companies and they are very different in size. Each factory has different processes. So, it is harder to carry out plans to improve the industry. Xinmo Screws worked with its suppliers and buyers. This helped them find the main problems more easily and make improvements more efficiently. It also showed the power of working together as a team. This gives more companies a chance to benefit and makes the whole industry more competitive.</p>
            <p>Businesses see the bigger picture: This should be another chance for Taiwan's traditional industries.</p>
            <p>Guo Ying-cheng said, "Actually, this industry should have worked hard to improve more than 20 years ago." He explained that at that time, a lot of Taiwan's industry money and technology went to mainland China. That was a chance for change. In recent years, money has come back. Also, because of global problems, many countries are trying to stop mainland China. This should be another chance for Taiwan's traditional industries.</p>
            <p>Guo Ying-cheng said that for companies, improving their industry means they might have to invest tens of millions of dollars first. But it's hard to say if they will see results right away. Also, traditional industries often face problems like not enough workers and high operating costs. Because of this, some companies decide to leave the market while they wait and see.</p>
            <p>He said that based on today's industry needs and trends, environmental sustainability will be a very important direction for development. Xinmo Screws will also continue to work hard to reduce carbon emissions, promote a green and sustainable environment, and actively join related projects.</p>
