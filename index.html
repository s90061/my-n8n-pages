            <h1>President: 2026 Sports Budget Over 20 Billion to Strengthen Taiwan Through Sports</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te met with athletes from the Chengdu World Games team today. He thanked them for fighting for the country and making great history. He said that the Ministry of Sport will officially start on September 9. In 2026, the central government's budget for sports will be over 20 billion New Taiwan dollars. He hopes this will create a better environment to make Taiwan stronger through sports.</p>
            <p>President Lai met with the athletes, coaches, and staff of the 2025 12th Chengdu World Games team this morning. He said in his speech that Taiwan's heroes have returned with success. "They won medals and brought them back." At this year's Chengdu World Games, Team Taiwan won 5 gold, 6 silver, and 4 bronze medals. This is the second-best result in the country's history and the best performance in an international competition.</p>
            <p>He said that Taiwan made a lot of great history at this year's games. No matter if they won or lost, or what their rank was, their hard work inspired and cheered up the public.</p>
            <p>President Lai talked about the athletes' achievements. For example, veteran powerlifter Hsieh Tsung-ting won a silver medal in the lightweight division. Chiang Kai-chieh won a gold medal in the middleweight division for deadlift. Yang Sen lifted 453.5 kilograms in the squat, which broke the world record, and his total score broke the event record. The President said that when he saw Yang Sen's eyes red during the competition, many people also cried tears of joy. He thanked him for lifting Taiwan up and showing it to the world. He called him a warrior from the Paiwan group and Taiwan's strongman.</p>
            <p>In the "Women's Tug-of-War" event, the President said that the athletes were not afraid of the rain. From the preliminary rounds to the finals, they won 7 matches in a row and took home the gold. They also achieved an amazing record of winning the women's tug-of-war event 6 times in a row, which is truly special. In the "Beach Korfball" event, they also won all their matches, getting the gold medal with 6 wins.</p>
            <p>In the "Women's Finswimming" event, the President said that Huang Mei-chien won a silver medal in her first time competing. He Pin-li also broke a national record. There are many other athletes he could not mention one by one, but "you are all the best, you are all Taiwan's heroes."</p>
            <p>The President also tested Huang Mei-chien by asking when the Ministry of Sport would be created. Huang Mei-chien immediately answered September 9, and the audience applauded warmly. President Lai said that on September 9, which is National Sports Day, the Ministry of Sport will officially start. Besides the National Sports Training Center and the Sports Science Center, a "National Sports Promotion Agency" and a "National Sports Industry Development Center" will also be established.</p>
            <p>The President stressed that sports show a country's strength. He hopes that by starting the Ministry of Sport, its position will be raised. With new rules and plans, more money will be given, and experts from different areas will join to create a better environment. Taiwan is now part of the world, and the good performance of Taiwan's heroes makes Taiwan shine even brighter. He hopes that together, they can make Taiwan stronger through sports.</p>
            <p>The President said that the Cabinet meeting today approved the central government's budget for 2026, and the sports budget is over 20 billion New Taiwan dollars. He hopes that athletes will achieve even more great results in the future.</p>

            <h1>Google Smartwatch Adds Raise-to-Talk Function, AI Can Be Used by Simply Raising Wrist</h1>
            <p>Google released its Pixel Watch 4 smartwatch today. It now has a "raise to talk" feature. You can just lift your hand, and when you see a blue light, you can talk to the AI built into the watch. It can answer your questions with text and voice.

This chip makes it 25% faster. For the first time, it also has an "emergency satellite communication" feature.</p>
            <p>Other important safety features include fall detection and car accident detection. Both of these features work in Taiwan and support Traditional Chinese.</p>
            <p>Another main new thing about the Pixel Watch 4 is the "raise to talk" feature. You just need to lift your wrist, and when a blue light appears on the watch, you can start talking to the AI. You don't need to say "Hey Google" or press any buttons.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Steelers Leave PLG, League Immediately Welcomes Yankee Engineering as 4th Team</h1>
            <p>The PLG announced today that the Kaohsiung Steelers have officially left the league. But at the same time, the league announced that "Yankee Engineering" has applied to join as the 4th team under Yankee Sports and Entertainment. The new season is expected to start as usual.</p>
            <p>After the P. LEAGUE+ (PLG) and the Taiwan Professional Basketball League (TPBL) could not agree to work together during the off-season, both leagues decided to continue on their own.</p>
            <p>Since early July, many players and coach Chiu Ta-tsung from the PLG Kaohsiung Steelers had their contracts end. This caused the whole team to stop working, making people worry about how the PLG would operate with only 3 teams next season.</p>
            <p>Today, the PLG's statement said, "The league received a letter from the Kaohsiung Steelers asking to leave the PLG. After a meeting, this request was approved today. The PLG thanks the Steelers for their efforts over the past 4 seasons and for greatly helping the league and local fans."</p>
            <p>The PLG stated that in the future, the PLG and its teams will aim to create the best professional basketball stage in Taiwan. They will continue to work for the good of Taiwan's basketball scene.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the PLG confirmed that "Yankee Engineering," a company from Hsinchu, will join the PLG as Yankee Sports and Entertainment. This was approved by the executive board in a meeting, making them the 4th team. In the future, they will form the team based on fair and healthy principles.</p>
            <p>After saying goodbye to the old and welcoming the new today, the PLG now has 4 teams: Taipei Fubon Braves, Taoyuan Pauian Pilots, Tainan TSG GhostHawks, and Yankee Sports and Entertainment.</p>
