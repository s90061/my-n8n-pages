        const text = `**The Rise of AI in Everyday Business**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how many businesses operate, from small shops to large companies. AI tools are becoming more common in daily tasks, helping businesses work more efficiently. For example, AI-powered chatbots now handle many customer service questions, answering quickly and freeing up human staff to focus on more complex issues.

In retail, AI helps recommend products to customers based on their past purchases, making shopping more personal. It also helps companies manage their stock better, predicting what items will be popular and when to reorder. This means fewer wasted products and more choices for shoppers.

However, the growth of AI also brings new challenges. Companies need to ensure that AI systems are fair and don't make biased decisions. There are also concerns about job roles changing as AI takes over some tasks, requiring employees to learn new skills. Despite these issues, businesses are investing heavily in AI, seeing it as a key to future success and innovation.

**Extreme Heatwaves Affecting Daily Life Globally**

Record-breaking heatwaves are becoming a regular part of summer in many parts of the world, making daily life challenging and even dangerous. Temperatures are reaching new highs, affecting everything from how people commute to their health. This extreme weather is a clear sign of ongoing climate change.

Cities are particularly affected, as concrete and buildings trap heat, making them much hotter than surrounding rural areas. People are struggling to work outdoors, and schools are closing or changing their schedules to avoid the hottest parts of the day. Energy grids are also under pressure as more people use air conditioning.

Governments and communities are looking for ways to adapt. This includes planting more trees to create shade, designing cooler buildings, and setting up public cooling centers. There's a growing awareness that these hot conditions are not just temporary but a new reality that societies must learn to live with and prepare for.

**The Growing Trend of the Four-Day Work Week**

A new work model, the four-day work week, is gaining popularity around the world. In this system, employees work fewer days, often 32 hours over four days, but still receive their full salary. Companies are experimenting with this idea to see if it can improve work-life balance and productivity.

Supporters say that a shorter work week can lead to happier employees, who then feel more motivated and less stressed. This can result in higher quality work and fewer sick days. Employees have more time for personal activities, hobbies, or family, which can improve their overall well-being.

However, some challenges exist. Not all jobs can easily switch to a four-day week, especially those that require constant customer service or presence. Some worry it might just mean longer workdays crammed into four days, leading to burnout. Despite these concerns, many trials of the four-day week have shown positive results, suggesting it could be a significant change in how people work in the future.`;
