            <h1>Nvidia's Earnings and Forecast Beat Expectations, But Stock Price Falls After Hours</h1>
            <p>Today, after the stock market closed, Nvidia, a top company for AI chips in the US, announced its financial report and future predictions. Both were better than what experts expected. However, the company's stock price went down after hours. This happened because investors are worried about too much spending on AI chips and that Nvidia's business in China might stop growing.</p>
            <p>According to reports from AFP and Reuters, Nvidia announced a profit of 26.4 billion US dollars (about 806.8 billion New Taiwan dollars) in the second quarter. Its income reached a new high of 46.7 billion US dollars. This success is because big technology companies need many chips for AI data centers.</p>
            <p>Nvidia also expects its income for the current quarter to be around 54 billion US dollars, plus or minus 2%. This is more than the 53.14 billion US dollars that analysts predicted. Nvidia believes that cloud service providers will greatly need its chips because they are making their systems bigger to use generative AI.</p>
            <p>Nvidia also said that its predictions released today do not include any planned shipments of its H20 chips to China.</p>
