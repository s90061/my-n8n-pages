            <h1>Bora Pharmaceuticals' CDMO Business Grows, Half-Year Earnings Per Share Reach NT$19.5</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals announced its financial results for the first half of the year. Its total income was NT$9.347 billion. Because its CDMO business grew, the company's net profit was NT$2.016 billion. This is an 11.9% increase from last year. Its earnings per share (EPS) were NT$19.5, which is almost twice the value of its shares.</p>
            <p>Today, Bora Pharmaceuticals shared in a press release that its CDMO business grew by 69.5% in the first half of this year. This includes orders from inside the company. The income from this business was more than NT$5.01 billion. This growth happened because the company increased its production ability and started making new types of medicines. However, during a time of change, production was slow at its sterile injectable drug factories in Maryland, USA, and Zhunan, Taiwan. But this problem got better in June. Orders that were delayed will now be filled. The company has a clear view of its orders and strong demand for a long time.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals said it continues to invest more in its CDMO business around the world. Recently, its factory in Canada added a new production line for skin medicines. This new line will help them make these medicines faster, in larger amounts, and more flexibly. This is one reason why the Canadian factory will continue to grow.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injectable drug production line in Maryland, USA, is expected to start working in the third quarter of this year. Starting in 2026, the AST automated filling system lines will also start to be used. Also, in the first half of this year, clients at the Maple Grove factory in Minnesota, USA, became stronger, long-term partners. Many drug companies have started to sign agreements because they want to make their products in the USA.</p>
            <p>Sheng Pao-hsi, the chairman of Bora Pharmaceuticals, said that the CDMO business has gained 8 new clients this year. Most of these new orders are from the Maple Grove factory, which is important for making products in North America. This year, new orders worth US$138 million have been added. Most of these new orders are for the Canadian factory and sterile drug factories. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego factory, which was part of the merger with TaiFu Biologics, has started working. Several US drug companies that are developing medicines have asked about the plan to increase production to 2000 liters.</p>
