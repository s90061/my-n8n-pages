            <h1>EuroBasket: Turkey Beats Poland and Moves to Semifinals</h1>
            <p>On September 9, in Riga, Latvia, Turkey won against Poland with a score of 91 to 77 in the EuroBasket quarter-finals. This victory means Turkey has now won 7 games in a row, which is their longest winning streak ever in this competition.</p>
            <p>The EuroBasket official website reported that this is the second time in history that the Turkish team has reached the semi-finals. Next, they will play against the winner of the game between Greece and Lithuania.</p>
            <p>Poland started the game very well. In the first 10 minutes, they stopped Turkey's center, Alperen Sengun, from scoring any points. But as soon as he scored, it changed the game completely. It made the crowd excited and ruined Poland's plans for the rest of the match.</p>
            <p>After Sengun scored with a dunk, Turkey played very strongly, scoring 22 points while Poland scored only 10. By halftime, Turkey's small lead grew to 46 to 32.</p>
            <p>Even though the Polish team tried their best to make the game more exciting, they could only get the score within 8 points when there were 3 minutes left in the game.</p>
            <p>Sengun, who is 23 years old, scored 19 points, got 12 rebounds, and made 10 assists. He also stole the ball 3 times. This NBA All-Star player played very well all-around. This was the seventh time in this EuroBasket that he had at least 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists.</p>
            <p>However, Turkey's win was not easy. Cedi Osman hurt his foot when he hit Mateusz Ponitka while blocking a shot under the basket. Osman left the game in the middle of the third quarter but came back with 5 minutes left to play.</p>
            <p>The Polish team fought until the very end. This is their second time in a row reaching the EuroBasket quarter-finals, but they could not repeat their fourth-place finish from 2022. Ponitka scored 19 points, made 6 assists, and got 6 rebounds, but he could not stop his team from losing.</p>

            <h1>Egypt-Israel Natural Gas Deal Worth Over One Trillion New Taiwan Dollars, Reshaping Global Energy Center</h1>
            <p>Cairo, September 9 (Central News Agency reporter Shih Wan-ching) â€“ In early August, Israel and Egypt said they would sign a natural gas export agreement worth 35 billion US dollars (about 1.0614 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). They plan to sign the agreement in the next few days. International energy experts say that this deal is the biggest natural gas export agreement in Israel's history. It will make Israel a strong energy country in the Middle East and make the Eastern Mediterranean a global energy center.</p>
            <p>News reports say that in August, Israel announced with Egypt that they would sign a natural gas export deal worth 35 billion US dollars from Israel's Leviathan gas field. They plan to send about 130 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Egypt by 2040. This will help with Egypt's energy problems and make the two countries work together more in energy.</p>
            <p>The year 2023 was a "dark year" for electricity in Egypt. Many Egyptians remember how difficult it was when they had power outages every day during the summer. In some areas, the electricity was off for up to 4 hours each day. The dry and hot weather made it hard to sleep, and many fresh foods went bad because they couldn't be kept cold and had to be thrown away.</p>
            <p>The main reasons for the big power outages in Egypt were that more people meant more demand for electricity. Also, the Zohr oil field, found in 2015, started to produce less. This meant there wasn't enough electricity. So, in 2020, Egypt started to look for natural gas from Israel.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Israel found the Tamar gas field in 2009 and the Leviathan gas field in 2010. Over the next 10 years, these discoveries changed Israel from a country that bought energy to an important energy seller. More than 90% of the gas from the Leviathan field is sold to Egypt and Jordan.</p>
            <p>Before, in 2005, Egypt opened a pipeline from Arish to Ashkelon to sell natural gas to Israel. But from 2011, the pipeline was often attacked because of fighting in the Sinai Peninsula. This caused the export agreement to fail. Then, from 2020, Egypt and Israel started to send natural gas in the opposite direction through the same pipeline.</p>
            <p>In February 2022, Russia attacked Ukraine, starting the Russia-Ukraine war. The European Union stopped buying natural gas from Russia to punish them. The EU then started a three-way deal with Egypt and Israel. Israel would provide natural gas, which would be turned into liquid gas in Egypt, and then sent from Egypt to Europe.</p>
            <p>Part of the reason for the big power cuts in Egypt in 2023 was that the Egyptian government, trying to fix its failing economy, sold its natural gas to Europe first to earn US dollars. This meant that Egypt, which uses natural gas for 90% of its electricity, had no gas to make power.</p>
            <p>Mamdouh Salameh, an international expert on oil and energy, told the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN) that Egypt has good facilities in Idku and Damietta to turn natural gas into liquid natural gas. These are the only facilities in the Eastern Mediterranean that can do this and then send it to Europe and Asia. Also, building a pipeline directly from Israeli oil fields to Europe would cost over a trillion US dollars. So, the best plan is for Israel and Egypt to work together to supply Europe.</p>
            <p>The "Middle East Broadcasting Networks" reported that Marian Wahba, a researcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) in Washington, a think tank focused on Israel, said the 35.0 billion US dollar deal helps Egypt become a main seller of liquid natural gas. It also makes Israel the new main energy power in the Eastern Mediterranean. This will help Europe to not rely on Russian natural gas and to get energy from many different places.</p>
            <p>The report also said that according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Eastern Mediterranean has more than 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that can be taken out. This has made big oil companies from all over the world want to work in this area.</p>
            <p>Ghaith al-Omari, a researcher at the Washington Institute, told the Middle East Broadcasting Networks that the Eastern Mediterranean has now become a central point in the global energy network.</p>
            <p>Al-Omari also said that this new Leviathan gas field deal between Egypt and Israel is not just about money. It is also an alliance driven by energy, making natural gas a way to create stability and cooperation in the region. This cooperation will change the balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean for both Israel and Egypt.</p>
