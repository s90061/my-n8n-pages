            <h1>People Threw Eggs at DPP Headquarters; Party Reports to Police for Action</h1>
            <p>The People's Party held a meeting today on Beiping East Road, near the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Central Party Headquarters. During the event, some people went inside the building and threw eggs at the DPP's main door and sign. DPP spokesperson Cho Kuan-ting stated that they have collected evidence and reported the incident to the police. He added that the party will discuss with lawyers to seek legal action and will not be lenient.</p>
            <p>On the last Sunday before the vote to remove lawmakers, the Kuomintang (KMT) National Youth Work General Association held a "Youth Salon" forum in their central party building. At the same time, the Taiwan People's Party held an event called "Democratic Uprising! Anti-Recall to Win, Taiwan to Win" in front of the DPP Central Party Headquarters. Both events were to support not removing lawmakers.</p>
            <p>DPP spokesperson Cho Kuan-ting said in an interview tonight that the KMT and People's Party are still confused. They do not want to face how they have damaged the constitution in the parliament over the past year. He said that emptying Taiwan and being friendly with China is the main reason why citizens started this big recall movement. Taiwan is now facing many challenges from inside and outside the country. The KMT and People's Party, as the majority in parliament, cannot be a "loyal opposition party." Instead, they are stopping Taiwan from moving forward steadily and even holding Taiwan back.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting also said that the People's Party ignored the KMT's "wrong, fake, and copied" actions when they started the process to recall DPP lawmakers. He said that over the past year, they have not lived up to their promise to be a "key minority" party. He advised both the KMT and People's Party to listen to what all citizen groups are asking for and stop being confused. He warned that creating political conflict and spreading rumors will only make people hate them more and will lead to punishment in the end.</p>
            <p>Also, Cho Kuan-ting stated that after the People's Party held an event below the DPP Central Party Headquarters today, some people took the elevator upstairs and threw eggs at the DPP office sign. The party headquarters has collected evidence and reported it to the police. They will talk with lawyers and take legal action. They will not be lenient.

            <h1>Korean Group DKB Visits Taiwan Quickly, Says Taichung Shows "Taiwan's Feel"</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 20 (CNA) â€“ The South Korean boy group DKB made a quick three-day visit to Taiwan for an event. They also filmed some parts of the event in Taichung. There is a popular term in Korea called "Taiwan's feel." Group member Junseo thinks Taichung represents this "Taiwan's feel" for him. He said the filming went very well, and he now really likes Taichung.</p>
            <p>This time, E-CHAN, D1, GK, Junseo, and YUKU from DKB came to Taiwan for the "CRUSH ON YOU POP-UP IN TAIPEI" event. The five members quickly visited for three days. They also went to Taichung to film for the event. They even made videos from a "girlfriend's point of view" so that BB (DKB fans) can travel with them and see every special moment.</p>
            <p>Today, the group members met with Taiwanese media and shared what "Taiwan's feel" means to them. Junseo said, "For me, Taichung can represent Taiwan's feel. We went to the market and also to a seafood restaurant by the sea. The filming there went very well, and I really like Taichung now."</p>
            <p>E-CHAN's idea of "Taiwan's feel" is "youth." He explained, "When Koreans experience Taiwanese culture, TV shows and movies are often about youth. The theme of this filming was also about youth, so the photos and videos turned out very beautiful."</p>
            <p>When asked what activities he would plan if he brought his girlfriend to Taiwan, GK said, "First, eat hot pot, mango ice, and bubble tea. Taiwan is the country of bubble tea! Then, go to Taipei 101, eat seafood. It sounds busy, and I also want to ride a bicycle to help digest the food." But his group members joked that he would smell like hot pot all day. So he quickly changed his answer and said, "I'll eat hot pot at night. For the first meal, I'll have beef noodles and fried chicken." (Edited by Chang Ya-ching) 1140720</p>

            <h1>Chong Lun Junior High Team A Wins Allianz Junior World Cup with Comeback</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 20 (CNA) â€“ The "2025 Allianz Junior World Cup Football Tournament," which is the biggest children's football event in Taiwan, held its final matches today. In the U15 group, Chong Lun Junior High Team A won the championship by making a big comeback in the penalty shootout (3-1). Their goalkeeper, He Gan-kai, played a very important role by using both his head and hands.</p>
            <p>The number of teams joining the event grew from 1107 last year to 1204 this year. The finals took place today at the University of Taipei's Tianmu Campus. The champions for each age group were U6 Little Devil Neptune, U8 Passionate Ball, U10 TFA Mexico Team, and U12 Football Seeds.</p>
            <p>The U15 final match was between Chong Lun Junior High Team A and Beibin Club. Chong Lun lost two goals at the start of the game. They were behind 1-3, but then they scored two goals to tie the game and force a penalty shootout.</p>
            <p>In the penalty shootout, both teams seemed a bit nervous and missed many shots. However, Chong Lun's Chen Sheng-en scored first. Then, Liao Guan-ying and Chiu Yan-shuo also scored. Their goalkeeper, He Gan-kai, used his stomach and face to block two of the opponent's shots. This helped his team make an amazing comeback and win.</p>
            <p>After the game, He Gan-kai laughed and said, "It hurt, but I'm very happy. My head felt dizzy when it happened, but I'm fine now. Everyone worked hard to get here, so we couldn't give up."</p>
            <p>He Gan-kai will go to Lingdong Senior High School after the summer break. He started playing football late, in the seventh grade. But he is tall, at 183 cm, and his family fully supports him. His personal interest also made him continue playing.</p>
            <p>Chong Lun coach Chen Rui-de said that they did not prepare specially for the Allianz tournament. He noted that playing on indoor artificial turf makes the game faster, and the speed of passing and running is different from usual. "Luckily, the kids didn't give up. I give them 100 points for their performance today," he said.</p>
            <p>Zhang Wu-ye, the secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei Mini Football Association, stated that this year they are working with Allianz Life to support the "FIFA Football for Schools" program. This program promotes health education and gender equality. They hope to continue using football to improve young people's health and help them develop good social, educational, and teamwork skills.
