            <h1>UK's 6th Astute-Class Nuclear Submarine Completes Important Dive Test</h1>
            <p>The UK's sixth "Astute-class" nuclear-powered attack submarine recently finished its main dive test. This brings it closer to becoming an official part of the navy.</p>
            <p>The UK plans to build seven "Astute-class" nuclear-powered attack submarines. Five are already in use. The sixth and seventh, named HMS Agamemnon and HMS Achilles, are still being tested and built. Their names come from old Greek stories.</p>
            <p>The UK Ministry of Defence said today that "HMS Agamemnon" successfully did its first dive test recently. The test lasted two days and happened at a shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, northwest England. This shipyard belongs to a big company called BAE Systems, which makes things for the military.</p>
            <p>The test checked many systems and features on the submarine. For example, it made sure the ballast tanks worked well to help the submarine float up. Navy engineers also checked the submarine's balance when it was both floating and underwater.</p>
            <p>"HMS Agamemnon" is 97 meters long and weighs 7400 tons. It has new nuclear technology and systems for finding and sensing things. It can travel around the world without coming to the surface.</p>
            <p>Like other "Astute-class" submarines, "HMS Agamemnon" will carry regular weapons. These include "Tomahawk" long-range missiles for attacking land and "Spearfish" heavy torpedoes. These weapons will help the UK better protect its nuclear weapons at sea, its aircraft carrier groups, and important underwater places.</p>
            <p>"HMS Agamemnon" had its naming and bottle-breaking ceremony last April. They used beer made by a local brewery for the ceremony.</p>

            <h1>New Rules for Innovation Board and Asia Innovative Fundraising Platform to Start on October 21</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced today that it will work with the Taiwan Stock Exchange, Taipei Exchange, Taiwan Futures Exchange, and Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation. On October 21, they will hold the 2025 Taiwan Week event. This event includes the "Asia Innovative Fundraising Platform Launch Ceremony, Industry Innovation Day Forum, and Asia Innovation Cup Finals." The FSC said they will make the rules for the innovation board and bond market better and more flexible. This will help Taiwan's stock market compete better in the world.</p>
            <p>Today, the FSC sent out a press release. It said that the event will begin with the Asia Innovative Fundraising Platform Launch Ceremony. By making the rules for the innovation board and bond market better and more flexible, they want to improve Taiwan's stock market's ability to compete internationally. They hope to quickly bring together important special industries, create a complete system for new ideas, and become a key center for new companies and money markets in the region. They also want to build a market for raising money using both stocks and bonds.</p>
            <p>The FSC explained that on that day, government departments and the Taiwan Stock Exchange and Taipei Exchange will be invited to the launch ceremony. Together, they will officially start the Asia Innovative Fundraising Platform.</p>
            <p>The Industry Innovation Day Forum will focus on key policies and global trends. The head of the Industrial Development Bureau, Xiao Zhenrong, and the head of semiconductor research for IDC Asia Pacific (who is also Taiwan's general manager), Jiang Fangyun, will give special speeches.</p>
            <p>After that, people from industry, government, and universities will talk and share ideas. These guests include Lin Yu-Sheng, Vice Chairman of the Taiwan Venture Capital Association; Li Guan-Zhi, Director General of the Small and Medium Enterprise and Startup Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Lu Zheng-Hua, Secretary-General of the Chinese National Federation of Industries; Xie Rong-Feng, Secretary-General of the Chinese National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association; and Chen Chun-Shan, Chairman of the Taiwan Digital Governance Association. They will discuss real plans and resources for developing innovative industries.</p>
            <p>The FSC said that the Asia Innovation Cup Finals will be the last part of the event. This competition will find promising new companies from Taiwan and other countries. It aims to create the most important platform in Asia for sharing ideas about capital and innovation. More than 70 teams entered the competition. Nine of these new companies are from other countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and Finland. They work in many different areas, such as artificial intelligence, digital cloud services, satellite communication, smart healthcare, and semiconductors.</p>
            <p>The FSC hopes that this event will help people from new companies in Taiwan and other countries talk and share ideas more. This will give new teams more chances to be seen and get money. At the same time, investors and businesses can find new chances to work together. This will help Taiwan slowly become a center for managing money in Asia.</p>

            <h1>2025 Nobel Prize in Economics Announced; Scholars Say it Connects with AI Changes</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was announced today. Three scholars won the award for explaining "innovation-driven economic growth." Scholars in Taiwan believe that as times change, there is more discussion about research, new ideas, and their effects on the outside world. This also matches the changes that AI is bringing today.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was given to three scholars: Joel Mokyr, who has both American and Israeli citizenship; Philippe Aghion from France; and Peter Howitt from Canada.</p>
            <p>Half of the prize money went to Mokyr. He was recognized for "finding the necessary conditions for continuous economic growth through new technology." Mokyr used old information to deeply study how steady economic growth became "the new normal." The other half was given to Aghion and Howitt together. They were recognized for "creating a theory that explains continuous growth through creative destruction."</p>
            <p>Wang Chien-nan, the Vice President of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, said that early economic theories talked about land, workers, and how much they could produce. As time passed, talks about research, new ideas, and so on became more important. Paul Romer, who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2018, talked about "endogenous growth theory," which is about growth caused by new ideas.</p>
            <p>This year's Nobel Prize winners talked more about how economic growth continues and the theory of "creative destruction."</p>
            <p>Wang Chien-nan used the current popular trend of AI as an example. He said that new technologies have grown fast in recent years. New ideas help the overall economy, but they might have good and bad effects for different people. Japan is a good example: its traditional car industry is very strong, so it is slow to bring in electric cars. It is not fully putting effort into developing them. This shows the possible problems that new ideas can cause.</p>
            <p>Wang Chien-nan also said that AI is a big trend. It can make things more efficient and productive. However, there isn't a clear way to make money from it yet, and it might make more people lose their jobs. These are all issues that come with new ideas.</p>
            <p>Wang Chien-nan thinks that for the government, to help the economy grow and stay active, it must encourage more new ideas. But at the same time, it needs to think about the extra costs that new ideas bring. Because of this, some people say that the government should also use social welfare programs. This would help avoid a situation where only a few people get all the benefits.</p>
            <p>Liang Kuo-yuan, an honorary professor at Tsing Hua University's College of Technology Management, said that this wave of AI is almost seen as a new industrial revolution. People hope that big new technologies can change society. But for AI, from research to building it up and then everyone using it, it's a very long process. It might look like long-term economic cycles along with economic growth.</p>
            <p>Liang Kuo-yuan said that Joseph Schumpeter, a great economist who has passed away, talked about "creative destruction" a long time ago. Now, economists are using his idea in new ways. This fits well with all the changes that the big AI wave has brought recently.</p>
