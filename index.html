**US Media: State Department to Lay Off Over a Thousand People, Criticized for Weakening US Global Standing**

US media says that the US State Department will let go of over 1,300 workers today. This includes more than 1,100 civilian staff and 240 diplomats. This is part of the Trump government's plan to cut down on extra staff. Critics say this will make America less strong in the world.

The Washington Post reported that the State Department will send notices to over 1,100 civilian workers and 240 diplomats. Diplomats will lose their jobs 120 days after getting the notice and will be on administrative leave. Most civilian staff will leave in 60 days. These job cuts are part of Donald Trump's plan to make the government smaller. Current and former diplomats say these cuts will make the US weaker around the world and reduce its soft power (influence through culture and values).

However, Trump government officials say the changes at the State Department are needed to make it work better and align with Trump's main goals. The East Asia and Pacific Affairs Bureau, which includes Taiwan, will remain.
