            <h1>Protests in the Philippines Over Water Project Scandal; Army on High Alert to Stop Trouble</h1>
            <p>Recently, there have been many protests in the Philippines. People are angry about a scandal involving public water projects and money problems. The Philippine army is now on "red alert." This is to stop anyone who might try to overthrow the government.</p>
            <p>Francel Margareth Padilla, a spokesperson for the Philippine army, spoke to DzBB radio today. She said that the armed forces of the Philippines have been on "red alert" since September 12th. They are ready to help the police to keep order and peace in the country.</p>
            <p>But Padilla also said that this is a normal safety step for the army. People should not worry.</p>
            <p>"Red alert" is the highest safety level for the Philippine army. All soldiers must be ready, and their holidays are canceled.</p>
            <p>These protests started because of a corruption case about water projects in August. At least 15 companies are thought to have worked with government officials and lawmakers. They took money for themselves. This led to bad work on projects, and some projects that were paid for never even existed.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance thinks that since 2023, these badly built projects have caused a loss of up to 118.5 billion Philippine Pesos. This is about 62.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Many places in the Philippines flood often when it rains. In low areas, the water can go up to the height of a one-story building. This has caused deaths and loss of property many times, making people very angry. Also, some relatives of the building companies showed off their wealth online. This made people even more upset. So, there have been many protests in the Manila area recently.</p>
            <p>News reports say that some groups who are against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have asked the army to stop supporting the government. They want to start a military rebellion.</p>
            <p>Since 1986, the Philippines has had two "People Power" revolutions. One of these led to the fall of Marcos Jr.'s father, the older Marcos. There has also been more than ten other attempts at military rebellions that did not succeed. Talking about military rebellions is still a very sensitive topic in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>On September 12th, Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto Teodoro and Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner Jr. made a public statement together. They said that the armed forces are loyal to the country and its laws.</p>
            <p>Padilla said that these protests might continue. To stop bad groups or people with bad plans from joining the protesters and causing trouble, the army is working closely with the police and other government groups to watch the situation.</p>
            <p>She also said that the army respects people's right to protest peacefully. But they will not let anyone spread violence or break the country's unity.</p>

            <h1>Mongolian Boy with Cleft Lip and Palate, Once Called "Alien," Now Wants to Help Others</h1>
            <p>Buyan, a 15-year-old boy from Mongolia, was born with a cleft lip and palate. Because of this, some people called him an "alien." He had 5 surgeries and a lot of therapy. Now, he can smile again and doesn't care about the name. He says that having a cleft lip and palate makes him special, not weak. He believes it's a good thing. He hopes to help other people in the future, just like someone helps you by holding an umbrella.</p>
            <p>Today, the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation held an event to give awards and sell charity calendars for 2026. Twelve artists with craniofacial conditions from Taiwan and other countries shared their stories. They asked people to buy the calendars to help patients with craniofacial conditions follow their dreams. Tamir Buyan, from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, was one of the international winners. He wore traditional Mongolian clothes and flew 3417 kilometers to Taiwan to get his award.</p>
            <p>Buyan faced problems from birth because of his cleft lip and palate. He remembers that when he was a small child, other kids made fun of him, saying he looked like an alien. He was only 5 years old and felt helpless and sad. Luckily, Buyan had a very wise mother. His mother changed the mean words into encouraging ones. She told little Buyan that aliens are very smart and can make UFOs to fly in the sky.</p>
            <p>The Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation has helped Buyan for over 10 years. They offered free medical care and trained medical teams in Mongolia. With their help, Buyan got the best medical care in Mongolia. After 5 surgeries and therapy, he can now smile just like everyone else. He wants to tell other craniofacial patients, "You are strong, and you are beautiful just as you are."</p>
            <p>Buyan understands others deeply because he used to feel sad about himself. Now, he doesn't care about what people say about him. Buyan says that being different doesn't make you weak. Instead, it's a strong point. "Be proud of your story, and never be afraid to shine brightly," he says. His parents are also very proud to see Buyan grow from feeling weak to being confident.</p>
            <p>The picture Buyan won an award for shows a doctor holding an umbrella. This picture represents the kind people who helped him in his life. He says he hopes to be that person who holds an umbrella for others in the future. Buyan's story shows his strong spirit. It also shows how people from different countries can work together in medicine. Now, he uses his art to bring hope and strength to the world.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-ling, the CEO of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation, said that this is the 22nd year they have made their charity calendars. By selling these calendars, they want to show people the great abilities of craniofacial patients. They want to give them courage and help them follow their dreams to become who they want to be. She asks everyone to buy the charity calendars to support craniofacial patients.</p>
