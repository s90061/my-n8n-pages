            <h1>Bloomberg: Microsoft says Chinese hackers used SharePoint weakness to get into systems</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg reported today that Microsoft says hackers from China, supported by the government, used a weakness in SharePoint software. They used this weakness to get into the document systems of many governments in different countries. Security experts said that even the U.S. federal and state governments were affected. The Chinese embassy in the U.S. said they are against cybercrime and also against making accusations without proof.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News said that Microsoft wrote on its blog about two hacker groups from China, called "Linen Typhoon" and "Violet Typhoon." These groups, supported by the Chinese government, used a flaw in SharePoint software. This software helps customers manage and share files on their computers, not through Microsoft's cloud. The hackers used this flaw to get into people's computer systems.</p>
            <p>Also, another hacker group from China called Storm-2603 also used the SharePoint weakness. They got into the document systems of governments and businesses in many countries.</p>
            <p>Microsoft said they are still looking into other groups that might be using the SharePoint weakness to hack into customer systems. These cyber attacks can change quickly. The hacker groups continue to combine their attacks.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. replied to the report. They stated that China strongly opposes all cyber attacks and crimes. They also strongly oppose making accusations about others without enough evidence. They hope that everyone will handle cyber incidents professionally, responsibly, and with good reasons, instead of guessing and making accusations.</p>
            <p>Some people who know about this event, but do not want to be named, said that the hackers used the software weakness. They have entered the computer systems of governments in Europe and the Middle East. They also got into systems for the U.S. Department of Education, Florida's tax office, and Rhode Island's state government, among others.</p>
            <p>Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher from ETH Zurich who studies Chinese cyber attacks, said these actions look like past cyber attacks supported by the Chinese government. This is based on who they targeted, the technology they used, and the first pieces of evidence.</p>
            <p>Eye Security, a company that helps with computer security, has helped 60 affected organizations. These include energy companies, consulting firms, and universities in countries like Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Amman, and the UAE. They have removed harmful software from hundreds of servers.</p>
            <p>Adam Meyers, a senior leader at CrowdStrike, an American computer security company, said that hackers might have tried to get into two important targets starting on July 7th. The company is still investigating. At first, the hackers' actions seemed like they were supported by a government. But as the attacks spread, they looked like they came from China.</p>
            <p>Microsoft said they have given instructions on how to fix the weakness in the SharePoint document software. They will also keep helping customers whose systems were hacked and had bad code put into them.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg also mentioned a report from another security company that did not want to be named. This report said that hackers also got into an American healthcare company. They were also preparing to hack a university in Southeast Asia. Organizations in Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK, and the U.S. were also targets for the hackers.</p>

            <h1>Trump: I will visit China soon; Philippines being too close to Beijing was not good</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump said today that he might visit China "in the near future." He said that the relationship between the U.S. and China is good, and China is being welcoming. He also mentioned that the Philippines was perhaps leaning a bit too much towards China before, which he thought was not good. But now, he said, they have "come back to our side." He added that he does not mind the Philippines dealing with China.</p>
            <p>Today, Donald Trump welcomed Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the President of the Philippines, at the White House. They had a meeting and answered questions from the media. Marcos Jr. is the first leader from a Southeast Asian country that Trump has met since returning to the White House.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked about when he plans to visit China and if he might meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, Trump replied, "We have many possible meetings." He said that Chinese President Xi Jinping has already invited him.</p>
            <p>Trump said he might go to China "in the near future." He added, "We will decide soon."</p>
            <p>Foreign news reported that the Kremlin said yesterday that if Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump are both in Beijing in September, it's possible they could meet.</p>
            <p>Also, when asked how the Philippines balances its relationship with the U.S. and China, Marcos Jr. said that the Philippines' foreign policy is independent. He believes there is no need to find a balance between the U.S. and China. He stated, "Our main concern is to protect our own land and use our rights as an independent country."</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. explained that to do these things, the Philippines needs to work with partners. He said, "Our strongest partner has always been the United States." The Philippines also works to create different groups and relationships with many countries. They want to work together with countries that think similarly.</p>
            <p>Trump then added that he doesn't mind the Philippines doing business with China. He said that Marcos Jr. must do what is right for his country. Trump also stated that the U.S. gets along well with China, and they "have a good relationship." He repeated that China is being welcoming.</p>
            <p>Trump said that the Philippines might have been a bit too close to China before. He believed this was not good for the Philippines. He noted that things have changed since he became president, and "they are back on our side." However, he also stressed that the Philippines can and should deal with China.</p>
            <p>The Philippines claims it has special rights to use resources in its economic zone, which goes 200 nautical miles into the South China Sea. This is based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. This area overlaps with parts of the South China Sea that China claims using its "ten-dash line." Because of this, the two countries have had many conflicts in the disputed waters for many years.</p>
            <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Marcos Jr. at the Pentagon on July 21st. He promised to make their military stronger to stop China. This includes putting in advanced missiles and drone systems.</p>
