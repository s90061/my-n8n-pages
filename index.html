**Global Chip Shortage Continues to Impact Electronics Production**

TOKYO, JAPAN - The global semiconductor shortage continues to wreak havoc on electronics manufacturers worldwide, forcing companies to scale back production and delay the launch of new products. From smartphones and laptops to cars and gaming consoles, nearly every industry is feeling the pinch. Analysts attribute the shortage to a perfect storm of factors, including increased demand for electronic devices during the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions. While some experts predict that the shortage will begin to ease in the coming months, others warn that it could persist well into next year. Companies are scrambling to secure chip supplies and invest in new manufacturing capacity, but these efforts will take time to bear fruit. Consumers can expect to see higher prices and limited availability of certain electronic products for the foreseeable future.
**New Study Reveals Link Between Social Media Use and Mental Health in Teens**

LONDON, UK - A new study published in the Journal of Adolescent Psychology has revealed a significant correlation between excessive social media use and increased rates of anxiety and depression in teenagers. Researchers found that teens who spend more than three hours per day on social media platforms are significantly more likely to experience symptoms of mental health disorders. The study also suggests that cyberbullying and social comparison play a significant role in this correlation. Experts are urging parents and educators to be aware of the potential risks of excessive social media use and to encourage healthy online habits among young people. They recommend promoting offline activities, limiting screen time, and fostering open communication about online experiences. The findings of this study underscore the need for further research into the impact of social media on mental health, particularly in vulnerable populations.
