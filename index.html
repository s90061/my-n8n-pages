World number one tennis player Aryna Sabalenka almost lost her match at Wimbledon today. But she played very well in the end and won against Laura Siegemund from Germany. The scores were 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. This win means Sabalenka is now in the semifinals.

The match was long, lasting 2 hours and 54 minutes. Sabalenka was almost out of the game in the last part, but she managed to come back and win.

This is the third time Sabalenka, who is 27 years old, has reached the Wimbledon semifinals. She was also in the semifinals in 2021 and 2023. She won the US Open last year and hopes to reach her fourth Grand Slam final in a row.

Sabalenka will play against Amanda Anisimova from the US or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova from Russia in the next round. After the game, Sabalenka said Siegemund played a great match and made her work hard for every point. Sabalenka was very happy with her win.

**US Sends Out New Tariff Letters, Trump Says EU Will Get Theirs Soon**

US President Donald Trump started sending letters yesterday to different countries about new taxes on goods (tariffs). He also signed an order to delay these tariffs until August 1st. Today, he said that the European Union (EU) will likely get their tariff letter in about two days.

Trump spoke at a meeting today and said the US is still talking with EU representatives. He mentioned that the EU has been acting nicely lately, but he felt they were not good to the US before. He also said he was not happy with Europe's rules for American tech companies.

Trump explained that "one letter means one agreement." He said it's not possible to meet with 200 countries, so they send a letter with a small number, like 25%, 35%, or even 60% or 70% in taxes.

In April, Trump announced new tariffs on many countries, which caused problems in money markets around the world. He then paused these tariffs for 90 days, with a 10% tax. Countries used this time to talk with the US to get lower tax rates.

However, the 90-day pause was ending on July 9th. Yesterday, Trump used social media to show letters sent to 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. These letters told them about their new tariff rates, which will be between 25% and 40% and will start on August 1st. For Japan and South Korea, the new rate is 25%.

**New Taipei City Firefighter Dies After Rescue Boat Flips Over, Fire Department Mourns**

Yesterday, in New Taipei City's Xindian District, a person drowned near Guangxing Bridge. During the rescue, the firefighters' boat flipped over. Sadly, a 37-year-old firefighter named Wu En-shuo died after being taken to the hospital. The New Taipei City Fire Department changed its Facebook cover photo to a candle in the dark to show their sadness.

The Fire Department said that yesterday afternoon, they received a report about a person drowning while paddleboarding. During the rescue, the water was very fast, causing the boat to flip many times. Five rescue workers fell into the strong water, and three of them, including a volunteer firefighter and two regular firefighters, drowned.

The Fire Department stated that firefighter Wu En-shuo had no heartbeat when he arrived at the hospital and could not be saved. The drowned civilian also died. Another volunteer firefighter and a regular firefighter were saved and are now in intensive care after getting their heartbeats back.

Wu En-shuo was a member of the Zhitan team and had been a firefighter for 16 years. His colleagues said he was very dedicated and always worked hard for firefighters' rights. They are very sad about what happened.

The Fire Department changed their Facebook photos to show their grief. Many people left messages saying, "Mission completed" and "Thank you for your hard work."

The Fire Department also mentioned that the area where the accident happened is dangerous. There are signs warning people that the dam upstream can release water at any time and that swimming or fishing is not allowed. It seems the drowned person did not follow these warnings.
