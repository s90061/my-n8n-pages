            <h1>Chinese Businesswoman Admits Guilt in Huge Bitcoin Fraud Case in UK Court</h1>
            <p>A Chinese businesswoman named Zhimin Qian has admitted in a UK court that she led a very large bitcoin fraud. The amount of money involved was billions of British pounds. She confessed to the Southwark Crown Court in London.</p>
            <p>Zhimin Qian used the name Yadi Zhang. She pleaded guilty in a global case where cryptocurrency was taken by authorities. The bitcoin assets taken are now worth about 5.5 billion British pounds (around 230.6 billion New Taiwan dollars). She admitted that she got and kept this illegal money.</p>
            <p>The London Metropolitan Police said that from 2014 to 2017, Yadi Zhang planned a big fraud in China. More than 128,000 people were tricked. The money she got illegally was then changed into bitcoin.</p>
            <p>The police also said that Ms. Zhang then used fake documents to leave China. She came to the UK and tried to wash money by buying properties in September 2018.</p>
            <p>Will Lyne, who leads the Economic and Cyber Crime unit at the UK Police, said this case is "one of the biggest in British history. It's also one of the largest cryptocurrency cases in the world in terms of money involved."</p>
            <p>This case was investigated for seven years. Last year, another woman involved, Jian Wen, was sent to prison for 6 years and 8 months. Police found that Jian Wen helped move a cryptocurrency wallet. It had 150 bitcoins, which were worth about 1.7 million British pounds at that time.</p>
            <p>After Zhimin Qian admitted her guilt, the court hearing for this case will continue on the 30th.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Stock Market Shakes After "50-50" Chip Manufacturing Idea; Monthly Line Is Key Support</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market went up very high last week. But then, people waited to buy before a holiday, so the market dropped by 443 points to 25580 points on the 26th. The U.S. Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, talked about an idea for Taiwan and the U.S. to share chip manufacturing "50-50." We need to see how this will affect the Taiwan stock market. Experts say the market is currently moving up and down at high levels. They suggest watching the monthly average line, which is about 25267 points, to see if it holds as support.</p>
            <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told American media about the idea of asking Taiwan to share chip manufacturing "50-50." During the holiday, U.S. stocks went up more than 300 points, and TSMC's shares in the U.S. also went up. It is not yet clear if Taiwan's stock market will be affected by this "50-50" chip idea. Also, TSMC's meeting with investors in mid-October will be very important.</p>
            <p>On the 26th, the Taiwan stock market closed at 25580.32 points. It went below 25600 points, losing 443.53 points. It also fell below the 10-day average line of about 25770 points. Experts believe the short-term trend for the Taiwan stock market is getting a bit weaker. The market is generally moving up and down at high prices. For investors, they advise to pay close attention to the monthly average line, which is around 25267 points, to see if it acts as a strong support level.</p>
            <p>Major U.S. stock indexes closed higher today. However, worries about new taxes, the government possibly shutting down, and important economic news coming soon limited how much they could rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 68.78 points, or 0.15%, closing at 46316.07 points. The S&P 500 Index went up by 17.51 points, or 0.26%, closing at 6661.21 points. The Nasdaq Index jumped by 107.09 points, or 0.48%, closing at 22591.16 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 10.06 points, or 0.16%, closing at 6315.11 points.</p>
            <p>TSMC will hold an investor conference for the third quarter on October 16th. The progress of making 2-nanometer advanced chips in large amounts will be a main topic. The market expects TSMC to start making 2-nanometer chips in big numbers as early as the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>Hotai Motor said on the 28th, during the Toyota GAZOO Racing Corolla Cup 2025 race, that the Taiwan car market will still be good in the fourth quarter. They are trying to keep car sales similar to last year. Hotai Motor's sales goal for this year has not changed. They aim to sell 165,000 new cars in total, including passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and other commercial vehicles.</p>
            <p>Kenda Rubber Industrial Co.'s chairman, Yang Chi-Jen, said at a new product launch on the 28th that Taiwan tires sold to the U.S. have a 25% tariff (extra tax). This affects how much people want to buy. But Kenda is not closing for days or giving unpaid leave, as some people on TV have said. They keep their strong position by offering products that are good quality for their price. Now, they are focusing on making tires for electric cars.</p>

            <h1>Dodgers Aim to Defend Title Against Reds in Playoffs; No MLB Team Has Won Back-to-Back in 25 Years</h1>
            <p>The Major League Baseball (MLB) playoffs start tomorrow. The Los Angeles Dodgers, led by Shohei Ohtani, will begin their journey to win the World Series again.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, the Dodgers could be the first MLB team in 25 years to win the championship two times in a row. They will play against the Cincinnati Reds at home in a Wild Card series. This series will have three games, and the first team to win two games moves on.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers, who spent a lot of money to build their team, won the World Series last year by beating the New York Yankees. Most experts thought they would easily reach the playoffs this season. However, things did not go as smoothly as expected. The team had many injured players, and their performance was not always good. The closer, Tanner Scott, who signed a 4-year contract worth 2.37 billion, did not play well. Because of this, they only got into the playoffs as a National League Wild Card team.</p>
            <p>Even though the Dodgers have won the National League West Division title 12 times in the last 13 years, they still need to fight hard in the Wild Card games this year to move forward. Only then can they play against the Philadelphia Phillies in the Division Series.</p>
            <p>However, the Dodgers have been playing better recently. This gives them a lot of confidence for the playoffs. The Dodgers won 8 out of their last 10 regular season games. They also beat the Seattle Mariners, who were the second-best team in the American League, 3-0.</p>
            <p>More importantly, most of the Dodgers' main pitchers are healthy and ready to play. Their starting pitcher lineup is amazing, and other teams envy it. It includes Blake Snell, who won the Cy Young Award before. He will be the starting pitcher for the first Wild Card game. The strong Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto will also pitch later.</p>
            <p>As for the "two-way" star Shohei Ohtani, he has played very well as a pitcher this season. He also hit 55 home runs this season, which is his best and a new team record. If the series goes to a deciding third game, he will be the starting pitcher.</p>
