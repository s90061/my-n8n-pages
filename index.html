            <h1>US Stock Market Had Mixed Results as Wall Street Watched the Federal Reserve Meeting</h1>
            <p>New York, September 16. Today, the four main US stock market indexes showed different results. This happened even though August retail sales were better than experts thought. It seemed that new taxes by Trump did not affect the US economy much. Instead, people were focusing on the Federal Reserve's important meeting.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went down by 125.55 points, which is 0.27%. It closed at 45757.90 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 Index went down slightly by 8.52 points, or 0.13%. It closed at 6606.76 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq Index dropped a little by 14.79 points, or 0.07%. It closed at 22333.96 points.</p>

            <h1>Trump Extends TikTok Deadline for the Fourth Time, Will Talk to Xi Jinping to Agree</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 16. Today, US President Donald Trump said that an agreement has been reached with China about the short video app TikTok. He will talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping on September 19 to "confirm everything." After this, the White House released an order signed by Trump. This order extends TikTok's deadline again until December 16.</p>
            <p>A US law said that TikTok must be sold to a non-Chinese company, or it would be banned. This was for national security reasons. This law was supposed to start the day before Trump became president in January this year. But when Trump took office, he said the "sell or ban" deadline for TikTok in the US would be moved back 75 days. Then, it was moved a second time to June 19, and then again to September 17.</p>
            <p>Just before the old deadline ended, Trump signed an order today. This order moves TikTok's deadline to December 16. This is the fourth time he has delayed the ban on this popular short video app in the US.</p>
            <p>This morning, Trump was leaving the White House to visit the UK. He told reporters, "We have an agreement about TikTok. I have an agreement with China, and I will talk to President Xi Jinping on Friday to confirm everything."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that "a group of very big companies want to buy it."</p>
            <p>News reports say that the US and China finished talks about taxes and money rules yesterday in Madrid, Spain. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that both sides have a basic agreement for TikTok.</p>
            <p>For a long time, Trump wanted to ban TikTok or make ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, sell its part. But later, he changed his mind and said he would protect TikTok. He believes TikTok helped him get support from young voters in the US election last November.</p>
            <p>TikTok is one of the social media apps that Americans use most often. It has about 170 million users in the US.</p>
