            <h1>Taiwan Biotech's First-Half Revenue Reaches a New High; Three Plans Help It Grow Globally</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Biotech, a company that makes generic drugs, earned more money in the first half of this year than ever before for that period. Their net profit and earnings per share (EPS) also grew compared to last year. Ms. Hou Jing-lan, the general manager, said their three main plans are still the same: bring in new international drugs, make new drugs in Taiwan, and sell difficult-to-make generic drugs to other countries. She believes the company will continue to grow this year.</p>
            <p>In the first six months of the year, Taiwan Biotech's income was 2.97 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is 12% more than last year. This is the highest income they have had for this period. Their profit, which belongs to the company's owners, was 676 million New Taiwan Dollars, an increase of 24.5%. Their earnings per share were 2.72 New Taiwan Dollars. Ms. Hou said in an online meeting today that their income grew because their existing products continued to do well, and a generic drug they make for serious fungal infections in the whole body sold very well in the United States, reaching new record sales.</p>
            <p>Also, the company's income grew because a company they invested in, Dong Sheng Hua, joined with a distributor last April. Also, sales of their cholesterol-lowering medicines are increasing. Other products that helped with income include medicines for cancer, serious illnesses, and general health care.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hou explained that Taiwan Biotech's main plans have not changed in recent years. They are working on three things at the same time: getting licenses to bring in new international drugs, making their own new drugs in Taiwan, and selling generic drugs that are hard to make to other countries.</p>
            <p>Regarding bringing in new international drugs, they look for promising products by getting licenses and working with distributors to sell them in other countries. For example, this year, they won a bid to provide 790,000 doses of a cell-based flu vaccine from CSL Seqirus for public health programs. The sales of flu vaccines, both public and private, have been growing, and they expect flu vaccine income to be the highest ever this year. This year, they are also working with Roche Taiwan again on a medicine that targets specific problems in the body, taken by mouth.</p>
            <p>For making their own new drugs in Taiwan, she said they want to make more new drugs. For example, a new antibiotic drug called Bobimixyn was released at the end of last year. This medicine is very important for patients and is now used in dozens of hospitals.</p>
            <p>As for selling difficult-to-make generic drugs to other countries, she mentioned that sales of Lipo-AB are continuing to reach new highs in the United States. They are now working hard to sell it in other areas too.</p>
            <p>She also pointed out that for Taiwan Biotech to be an international drug company, it is very important that their factories pass inspections. Their two factories, in Liudu and Zhongli, passed a US inspection in July this year. This is very important for Taiwan Biotech to sell its products in other countries. A new lung cancer drug is also expected to get its license in the last three months of this year, which will be an important medicine for treating lung cancer.</p>

            <h1>"We TAIWAN" Event in Osaka Was Very Popular; Japanese Visitors Said "This is the Taiwan Pavilion!"</h1>
            <p>The "We TAIWAN: Taiwan Culture in Osaka - Kansai Expo" event in Japan lasted for 19 days and was very successful, winning the hearts of many Japanese people. Some people created new comics about "a-We," the event's mascot. Others wanted to visit Taiwan because of the event. Some visitors who had been to the Osaka Expo said, "This is exactly like the Taiwan Pavilion!"</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Culture organized the "We TAIWAN" event. The character "a-We" was announced in May to show that Taiwan would be part of the Expo. Products with "a-We" on them were popular even before the event and sold very quickly during the event. Many Japanese people took photos with the "a-We" statues at the event, and many also drew comics and pictures of the mascot online.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese groups brought many different activities to the event, including crafts, art, plays, books, and movies. The Ministry of Culture announced today that many people were surprised by how much Taiwan has advanced in cultural technology. For example, a visitor who experienced the "Huang Yi & KUKA" dance performance with audio descriptions said, "People who can hear, cannot hear, can see, and cannot see can all enjoy it. Everyone was thought of."</p>
            <p>After watching a Taiwanese movie, one visitor wrote, "I truly hope Taiwan's bright, warm, and kind culture, and its people's peaceful and hardworking lives can continue forever." Also, a Japanese fan of traditional Taiwanese puppet shows wrote some puppet show lyrics using AI. When a member of a Taiwanese puppet show group read the lyrics to her, the Japanese fan was so moved that she cried.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wu Ji-juan, one of the main people who organized the cultural technology exhibition, said that more than 80% of the visitors had never seen a Taiwanese performance before. One person watched four virtual reality (VR) shows in one day and said, "Thank you for planning so many shows. You really made me feel a different Taiwan." When she saw that visitors wanted to know more about Taiwan or hoped to visit, she thought, "This must be the main goal of 'We TAIWAN' when it plans and organizes big events around the world."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin Kun-ying, who organized the "Taiwan Spectrum" part of the event, said that as a Taiwanese person, he always remembers that the most important cultural strength is to believe first, not to wait until the world notices you before you speak up. "We TAIWAN" is a way to invite the world to understand Taiwan. When he heard a visitor say, "This is not just an exhibition, it's a journey to understand Taiwan," he knew right then that "we did something right. Taiwan's culture was not just seen, but it was believed in."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture stated that "We TAIWAN" welcomed everyone with open arms and many choices. Visitors could choose what they liked and see different parts of Taiwanese culture. This made many visitors who came from the Expo Yumeshima Park say, "This is the Taiwan Pavilion."</p>
