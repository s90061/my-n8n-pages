            <h1>President Lai Visits Banqiao Shenqiu Fude Temple, Talks About Youth Policies</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te went to Shenqiu Fude Temple in Banqiao, New Taipei City, this afternoon. He went there to give thanks. He said that the government is working hard to help young people. They give money for education, help with rent, and have other plans for young people. This is so young people can follow their dreams without worries. He hopes that by helping young people grow, the country will become better.</p>
            <p>President Lai visited Shenqiu Fude Temple in Banqiao District, New Taipei City, this afternoon. He burned incense to thank the God and Goddess of the Earth for helping him and Vice President Hsiao Mei-chin win the election. When he arrived, many people welcomed him warmly and shouted, "Hello, President!"</p>
            <p>He went into the temple with Su Chiao-hui, who is in charge of the Democratic Progressive Party in New Taipei City, Legislator Chang Hung-lu, and several city council members. Then, he went to the basement to talk with neighborhood leaders. He said that today, the God and Goddess of the Earth looked happier than the last time he visited. He prayed for the country to be peaceful and safe, for the weather to be good, and he also wished that the people there would make a lot of money.</p>
            <p>President Lai said that education is the most important investment for a country. The government now pays for high school education. University students in private schools also get money for their tuition. Students from poor families can get even more help. There is also help for dorms and for renting a place to live outside of school. The government also provides a monthly pass for public transport called TPASS. These actions stop money problems from stopping children from getting an education.</p>
            <p>The President said that the government is actively using education help, rent support, and youth policies. They are also offering new "Qing'an" loans to help young people buy homes and start families. They are continuing the plans from former President Tsai Ing-wen's time. They are still building public housing to give more living choices.</p>
            <p>President Lai especially mentioned the "Youth Billions Overseas Dream Fund." This fund helps young people aged 15 to 30 go overseas to follow their dreams. For example, some have gone to New York to learn street dance, to Japan to learn makeup, and to Thailand to learn cooking. He hopes young people will see more of the world. He wants young people to follow their dreams without worries. He hopes that by training talented people, the country will make more progress.</p>
            <p>President Lai shared that one of his primary school classmates had to work in a factory after graduation because his family did not have enough money. Now, Taiwan's economy has grown, and the government collects more taxes. So, the government should take better care of people who are not rich. This will stop children from losing the chance to get an education because of their family's money problems.</p>

            <h1>Tseng Chun-hsin Wins First Home Davis Cup Match, Helps Taiwan Tie with Norway on Day One</h1>
            <p>The Davis Cup is an international men's tennis team competition. It is World Group I and is happening in Taiwan. On the first day, the Taiwan team tied with Norway 1-1. Tseng Chun-hsin, who is Taiwan's top singles player, won his first home Davis Cup match. He said he was very excited.</p>
            <p>The Davis Cup World Group I uses a "best of 5" system. The team that wins 3 matches wins overall. Taiwan is playing at home in the Taipei City Tennis Center against Norway, a strong team. The team that wins this match will get to play in the 2026 World Group Finals. On the first day today, two singles matches were played.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's first player was Wu Tung-lin. He played against Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, a 19-year-old new player from Norway. Wu Tung-lin won the first set 6-4. But then he lost the next two sets 3-6 and 4-6. So, he could not get the first win for Taiwan. Luckily, in the second singles match, Tseng Chun-hsin played very well. He easily beat Viktor Durasovic with two sets of 6-1. This helped Taiwan tie the score.</p>
            <p>Last year, Tseng Chun-hsin lost two singles matches against Bosnia and Herzegovina. But now he has finally won his first home Davis Cup match. After the match, Tseng Chun-hsin spoke to reporters. He said he was very excited. He also said that even though the scores looked very different, preparing for the match and keeping a good mindset was a challenge. He said that not winning at home before had always been a worry for him. "At first, I felt a bit stiff and wasn't fully relaxed. But then I started to play better and better."</p>
            <p>Tseng Chun-hsin especially thanked everyone on his team. For the past two weeks, he trained with head coach Lu Yen-hsun and other players. He slowly learned how to use his strengths and played his best. "I played quite well in all areas, but there is still one more match tomorrow, so I cannot take it lightly."</p>
            <p>Wu Tung-lin said he played well overall and showed his own style. Also, there were many fans cheering, which gave him a lot of energy. But he had some stomach problems a few days ago, which made him tired faster. He said he would rest well and get ready for tomorrow's match. "No matter who the opponent is, I will try my best point by point."</p>
            <p>Coach Lu Yen-hsun said that the winner will be decided on the second day of the competition. This means both teams still have a chance. He will help the players get ready tonight. He also said that Wu Tung-lin and Tseng Chun-hsin played well. "We hope to keep the victory in Taiwan."</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Brands Join International Rice Festival in Northern Italy for the First Time</h1>
            <p>The "International Rice Festival" is happening in Vercelli, a city in northern Italy. This year, for the first time, several rice companies from Taiwan joined together to show their products. Their theme is "Making Friends with Rice, Tasting Taiwan." They want to show how varied Taiwan's food industry is and how creative its food ideas are.</p>
            <p>The annual International Rice Festival (RisÃ² â€“ Festival Internazionale del Riso) started on September 12th and will last for three days. Many important Italian government officials attended the opening ceremony. These included Francesco Lollobrigida, Italy's Minister of Agriculture, and Alberto Cirio, the leader of the Piedmont region.</p>
            <p>Lin Zan-nan, the head of the Taipei Representative Office in Milan, was invited to attend. He was with Emanuele Pozzolo, an Italian Member of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Representative Office in Milan sent out a press release. It said that Vercelli is one of Europe's largest areas for growing rice. The International Rice Festival focuses on promoting rice and food culture. It includes selling farm products, cooking shows, market events, cultural talks, and special areas for different countries. Every year, tens of thousands of visitors and hundreds of brands come to the festival. People who join include farmers, food importers, chefs, and regular shoppers.</p>
            <p>This year, with help from the Taipei Representative Office in Milan, the Association of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in Italy (ACTI) brought a group of Taiwanese companies to the festival for the first time. They worked with an Italian local rice brand, Cascina Bellaria. Their theme was "Fa l'amicizia con riso â€“ Making Friends with Rice, Tasting Taiwan." They invited several Taiwanese brands and new companies to join. They want to show how varied Taiwan's agricultural food industry is and how creative its food ideas are.</p>
            <p>The Taiwanese area at the festival had many different things. It showed information about Taiwanese rice types and their good quality. It also had special products like rice desserts and ready-to-eat meal packs. At the same time, they promoted rice-related technology and new biological uses. For example, they showed health products made from fermented rice and how rice husks can be reused. They hope to find new business chances around the world and find partners to work with.</p>
            <p>Chang Ling-yin, the head of the Association of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in Italy, said that Taiwan is proud of its many different food cultures. Rice is a very important part of this. She hopes that by joining this festival, Taiwan's rice, which people work hard to grow, will shine on the world stage. This will help Taiwan be known more around the world.</p>
