            <h1>Microsoft SharePoint Software Flaw Affects US National Lab</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., July 29, Central News Agency) Reuters, citing a Bloomberg report, stated that a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy said that hackers recently tried to attack using a flaw in Microsoft SharePoint software. One of the 17 national laboratories under the U.S. Department of Energy was also affected.</p>
            <p>The Energy Department spokesperson said: "The attackers indeed tried to enter Fermilab's SharePoint server." This refers to the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Fermilab was started in 1967. It is one of the most important places in the U.S. for studying particle physics. It has modern particle accelerators.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson added that "the attackers were quickly found, and the problem was very small. No sensitive or secret information was taken." Fermilab's servers are now back online and working normally.</p>
            <p>Microsoft, Fermilab, and the U.S. Department of Energy did not answer Reuters' requests for comments right away.</p>
            <p>Microsoft released a security update last month, but it did not fully fix a big flaw in its SharePoint server software. This flaw was found in May this year and allowed global online spying to happen.</p>
            <p>Last week, a U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson told Reuters that the SharePoint security flaw affected the Energy Department's systems on July 18. This included the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Energy said at that time that all affected systems were working normally again. (Translator: Liu Wen-yu / Editor: Tsai Chia-min)1140730</p>

            <h1>Yuan Ze University and US University Sign MOU for Dual Degrees and Shared Courses</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 30, Central News Agency reporter Hsu Chih-wei) Yuan Ze University and Illinois Institute of Technology in the U.S. have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). In the future, they will offer dual degrees, exchange programs, shared courses, and two-way exchanges for teachers and students. They hope to create more international opportunities for their staff and students.</p>
            <p>Today, Yuan Ze University and Illinois Institute of Technology held an online ceremony to sign the academic exchange MOU. Yuan Ze University President Liao Ching-jong, Vice President Hsu Tse-chih, and Dean of Academic Affairs Hsieh Chien-hsing were there. Both sides will work together to promote international academic exchange, research cooperation between countries, and global talent development.</p>
            <p>This cooperation was made possible by Xu Guo-an, who is an alumnus of Illinois Institute of Technology and the Chief Innovation Officer of Far Eastern Group. Yuan Ze University's President Liao Ching-jong is also an alumnus of Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p>Liao Ching-jong said that Yuan Ze University has worked hard for a long time to become more international. They have made partnerships with top universities overseas and keep making their global cooperation stronger. Illinois Institute of Technology has the highest number of international students among all U.S. universities. It was also the first U.S. university allowed to open a branch campus in India. This cooperation is an important step for sharing academic resources. It also creates bigger international chances for teachers and students.</p>
            <p>According to the MOU, the two universities will work together in many ways. This includes academic research, shared courses, student exchange, and dual degree programs. They will also strengthen their educational and research connections through two-way exchanges for teachers and students, joint research projects, and cultural activities. Both sides will also plan 2+2 bachelor's degree programs and 1+1 master's degree programs, giving students many ways to study abroad.</p>
            <p>To make sure the cooperation goes well, Yuan Ze and Illinois Institute of Technology will each choose a special department. These departments will be in charge of organizing and starting the different parts of the cooperation. They will also check and report on the progress regularly. For student exchange, the focus will be on short-term study. They will set rules for entry, credit transfer, and tuition fees. For teacher exchange, the focus will be on teaching and research, to make academic interaction and knowledge sharing stronger between the two schools.</p>
            <p>To promote internationalization, Yuan Ze University also started the "Thousands of People Abroad Program" in 2023. The Xu Yuan-zhi Foundation provides money for this program. It combines with the Ministry of Education's "Study Abroad Program" scholarships. This program helps students get more chances to study abroad through winter and summer courses, overseas study camps, student exchange, and dual degrees. Also, the number of international students at Yuan Ze University has grown each year, from about 8% in the 2020-2021 school year to about 12% in the second semester of the 2024-2025 school year.

            <h1>Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung: Peace Needs Strength, Democracies Must Show Resolve</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 30, Central News Agency reporter Yang Yao-ru) Matthew Pottinger, who leads the China Program at the "Foundation for Defense of Democracies," brought a group to Taiwan to join a tabletop exercise. When Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung met them, he said that peace needs to be supported by strength. Democratic partners must show their will and ability to keep peace and stability in the region.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung wrote on Facebook this morning that on July 28, he met with Matthew Pottinger, the head of the China Program at the "Foundation for Defense of Democracies" (FDD), at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They talked deeply about how Taiwan and the U.S. can work together in economic and safety areas.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung stated that this time, Matthew Pottinger and the "Foundation for Defense of Democracies" group will work with partners in Taiwan. They will hold a tabletop exercise about energy. They will discuss how to make Taiwan's energy system stronger by working with countries like the U.S. and Japan. Lin used this chance to explain to Pottinger that Taiwan hopes to buy natural gas from Alaska in the U.S. and invest there. This will give Taiwan more energy sources and make its energy system stronger. It will also bring real benefits to both Taiwan and the U.S.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung stressed that peace must be supported by strength. Countries that believe in democracy must show they are determined and able to keep peace and stability in the area. Matthew Pottinger has always strongly supported Taiwan. The "Foundation for Defense of Democracies" has worked closely with Taiwan for many years. It is an important partner for Taiwan's "Track Two" diplomacy, and it has a lot of influence in Washington D.C. and in public policy.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the foundation has focused on problems caused by the growing power of China's authoritarian rule. Lin Chia-lung shared what Pottinger said: In recent years, the U.S. has shown strong support for Taiwan through new laws and military help. More Taiwanese people should know about these efforts to fight against China's information warfare, which uses false information.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung also mentioned that in February this year, Matthew Pottinger came to Taiwan for the launch of the Chinese version of his book, "The Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan." Lin Chia-lung also went to the event and showed his support for Pottinger's ideas. This time, Lin Chia-lung specially congratulated Pottinger that his book has now become a bestseller. Pottinger joked that Lin Chia-lung "should get some royalties."</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung said that after the meeting, Pottinger gave him a crystal decoration with a laser-engraved "porcupine" design. This symbolizes that even if Taiwan is a small country, it can use a "porcupine strategy" to defend itself. This would make any attackers afraid to act carelessly. (Editor: Su Lung-chi)1140730</p>
