On July 1st, China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, met with Belgian Prime Minister De Wever in Brussels. Wang Yi said that China and Europe should continue to be partners and work together for shared success. This is important because the world is changing a lot.

Currently, China and Europe have some disagreements, for example, about taxes on electric cars and how China controls rare earth materials. Wang Yi's visit is to help prepare for a meeting between leaders from China and Europe, which is expected to happen later in July in China.

Belgian Prime Minister De Wever told Wang Yi that even though Europe and China see things differently, they should talk more and trust each other because of the complex global situation. He also said that Belgium strongly supports the "One China" policy and this will not change.

Wang Yi also said that China and Europe are two big powers, markets, and cultures. They should keep working together, talk more, understand each other better, and build trust. This way, they can help keep the world stable and be strong partners for each other. They also discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Some people think that China wants to improve its relationship with the EU because of its strained relationship with the US. Wang Yi's visit aims to discuss relations, important global issues, build trust, and solve disagreements.
