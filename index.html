            <h1>23-Year-Old Vietnamese Young Person Writes "The Barbershop on the Rooftop" and Wins Migrant Literature Award</h1>
            <p>The 10th Migrant Literature Award winners were announced today. Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Hi·ªÅn, a 23-year-old from Vietnam, won the top prize for her writing about "The Barbershop on the Rooftop." Her story talks about human relationships and kindness.</p>
            <p>The story describes a barbershop on the top floor of an old building in a Taichung night market. A Vietnamese woman named A-Mei runs it. She does not ask for money. Instead, she accepts mangoes, cookies, or simply a "thank you." She left her home country many years ago and has no home. She uses her scissors and kind words to ask migrant workers from different countries in Taiwan, "How have you been lately?" This helps many people who feel lost and far from home.</p>
            <p>The event organizers shared in a press release that this year's judges were very well-known. Director Wu Nien-jen, actress Janine Chang, former director of the National Museum of Taiwan Literature Lin Chin-li, writing teacher Tsai Chi-hua, and Professor Kuan Chung-hsiang from National Chung Cheng University were invited to be judges.</p>
            <p>Wu Nien-jen highly praised "The Barbershop on the Rooftop." He said the story flowed naturally and felt very real. It did not add too much emotion. He said it was full of clear pictures and had a strong ending, making it very good for a film. He even thought about calling PTS (Public Television Service) to suggest making it into a movie after reading half of it.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-li thought that "this article has a complete structure. It describes the scene and builds emotion deeply. It is very vivid, and the writing is excellent."</p>
            <p>This year, 166 works were sent in from 5 countries. There were 88 from Indonesia, 33 from Vietnam, 27 from the Philippines, 13 from Thailand, and 5 from Myanmar. The judges who speak the native languages chose 35 good works. After these were translated, the final judges picked the winning works.</p>
            <p>What was special this year was the new "Youth Judges" group. Almost 60 talented and enthusiastic young people aged 15 to 20 were considered. The organizers looked at where they came from, their gender, education, life experiences, and if they were "new second generation" immigrants. In the end, 5 youth judges were chosen. They brought new ideas and energy to the Migrant Literature Award.</p>
            <p>You can find the full list of winners on the "Taiwan Literature Award for Migrants" Facebook page.</p>

            <h1>Trump Eases Rules for Commercial Rocket Launches, SpaceX May Benefit</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 13 (Central News Agency) ‚Äì US President Trump today signed an official order. This order makes it simpler to control commercial rocket launches. It is expected to help Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, and other private space companies.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the White House said in a statement that Trump's order tells the US Secretary of Transportation to remove or speed up environmental reviews by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for rocket launch permits.</p>
            <p>This order also asks the Secretary of Transportation to look at and cancel old, repeated, or too strict rules for rocket launches and returns. It says that "slow approval processes stop new investments and new ideas. This limits American companies from leading in the world's space market."</p>
            <p>The order also mentioned: "Rules for environment and other permits that are too complicated slow down commercial space launches and building space infrastructure. This gives an advantage to old companies that can pay for these rules, and makes it harder for new companies that cannot pay high costs."</p>
            <p>Elon Musk and Trump have had disagreements recently, and their relationship has changed quickly. However, Musk's SpaceX is still expected to be the main and most direct company to benefit from this new order.</p>
            <p>Even though Trump's order did not name SpaceX, SpaceX launches rockets much more often than all other US space organizations, including NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).</p>
            <p>Musk has complained that environmental checks and accident investigations have often slowed down tests for SpaceX's new "Starship" rocket at its launch site in southern Texas.</p>

            <h1>Four Big Restaurant Groups Open More Shops in New Malls and On Streets</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 14 (Central News Agency) ‚Äì The demand for dining out is strong. Four large restaurant groups are opening new shops faster this year. They are moving into popular areas on streets and in new shopping centers. The food part of Lion Travel Group wants to double its sales in three years. Kanpai will continue to open more hot pot restaurants. Wowprime will open shops in the United States. And the Dohtonbori Group aims to reach 100 shops this year.</p>

            <p>Kanpai explained that since it started, Kuromonoya shops have mostly been in department stores and shopping centers. Now, they have 15 shops. As there are fewer spots available in malls, the brand is starting to open shops directly on streets.</p>
            <p>Lion Travel Group announced today that its food business, "Xin Shi Lu," is growing. Its brand gonnaEXPRESS opened a shop in the Xinyi DREAM PLAZA mall on July 25 this year. This is the 11th shop for Xin Shi Lu. It aims to get customers from offices and gyms in the Xinyi area.</p>
            <p>Xin Shi Lu currently has the coffee shop brand "Guang Yi" and its own brand "gonna." It has 6 gonnaEAT shops that are stand-alone or in malls, 2 gonnaEXPRESS shops for food courts and office areas, and 1 gonna+ shop with special designs.</p>
            <p>Xin Shi Lu stated that all its brands are doing well. Their sales goal for 2025 is 500 million NT dollars. In the first half of this year, sales increased by over 20% compared to last year. Next year, the brand will grow quickly. They plan to open 12 more shops in the next three years. Their yearly sales are expected to double.</p>
            <p>Wowprime Group's sales reached a new high in the first half of the year, at 3.052 billion NT dollars. Its profit after tax was 175 million NT dollars, and its earnings per share were 4.47 NT dollars. In the second half of the year, they will open shops faster and start opening shops overseas. Besides opening 1010 Xiang and YABI KITCHEN in Dream Plaza in July, the group is also growing in central and southern Taiwan. Wowprime will open shops in malls in Taichung and Tainan in August.</p>
            <p>Wowprime said that in Taiwan, they are focusing on having many different brands. Their "Global Research and Development Center" in Zhongli, Taoyuan, is expected to open in the fourth quarter. It will help with their growth in overseas markets. The first two shops in the United States are expected to open in the fourth quarter in major areas of Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>The Dohtonbori Group, which owns brands like Tofu House, had total sales of 1.959 billion NT dollars in the first half of the year. This is a 14.14% increase from last year and a new record for this period. Due to exchange rate changes in the second quarter, the group's profit in the first half of the year was 183 million NT dollars, a 9.31% decrease from last year. Earnings per share were 6.85 NT dollars.</p>
            <p>The Dohtonbori Group said that its brand "Han Jiangxi's Small Kitchen" opened 3 new shops in June and July. This brand now has 20 shops. The group's "Jiang Man Tang" also opened its first shops in Taipei and New Taipei City in Dream Plaza in July. By the end of July, the group had 87 shops across Taiwan for its 7 brands.
