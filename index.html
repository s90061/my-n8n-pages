            <h1>The U.S. Makes a New Rule to Limit Samsung, SK Hynix, and Intel from Making Chips in China</h1>
            <p>According to a new U.S. government announcement, the United States will remove a special permission. This permission allowed big chip companies like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Intel to get U.S. equipment for making computer chips in China. This new rule will make it harder for these companies to make chips in China.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that in 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce stopped all sales of U.S. chip-making equipment to China. However, American company Intel, and Korean companies Samsung and SK Hynix, were given a special exception. This exception allowed them to keep making chips in China.</p>
            <p>Now, if these companies want to buy U.S. chip-making equipment for their factories in China, they will need a special license first.</p>
            <p>This new rule for licenses will likely mean that U.S. companies that make chip production equipment, such as KLA, Lam Research, and Applied Materials, will sell less to China. This might also help Micron, a main U.S. competitor to Samsung and SK Hynix in the memory chip market.</p>
            <p>The government announcement says that this new rule for buying equipment will start in 120 days.</p>
            <p>Even though Intel sold its NAND Flash memory chip factory in Dalian, China, to SK Hynix some years ago, it continued to make chip wafers there until this year.</p>

            <h1>Huaqiao High School Beats Fengyuan Commercial to Reach Volleyball Finals</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Summit Youth Volleyball Invitational Tournament is now in its second-to-last day. In the boys' division, National Huaqiao Senior High School was losing 5 to 10 in the final game. But in the end, they came back to win 18 to 16 against Fengyuan Commercial High School. Tomorrow, they will play against Pingtung Jih Rong High School for the championship.</p>
            <p>This is the fourth year of the Summit Youth Volleyball Invitational Tournament. In the boys' games, there was a tough match between two strong teams, Huaqiao and Fengyuan Commercial. Both teams are well-known in the High School Volleyball League (HVL). They were playing for a spot in the final game. After four games, the score was 2-2. In the fifth game, Huaqiao was far behind and looked like they would lose. But they managed to get back into the game. Also, Fengyuan Commercial had trouble with their serves, which helped Huaqiao stay in the match.</p>
            <p>Huaqiao saved their opponent's match point twice. Then, at a very important moment, player Lin Li-wei stepped up. He made a powerful spike, giving his team a match point. Finally, Huaqiao won with a successful block at the very end. This allowed Huaqiao to win the exciting game 18 to 16.</p>
            <p>After the game, Huaqiao team captain Huang Pin-yan spoke to reporters. He said that when they were leading by two games at the start, he just wanted to finish the game quickly. But then their setter got hurt, which affected the team's spirit. Huang Pin-yan then told his team, "I've got this." He added, "The key to winning was following the coach's instructions: just get the serve over the net, and then work hard on defense and counter-attacks."</p>

            <h1>Government Says New Law Causes Lianjiang County's Tax Money to Drop</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Finance used a new formula today to figure out how much tax money each city and county will get next year. The government explained that because of a problem with the formula in the new law, Lianjiang County will get less money next year. So, the central government will give extra money to Lianjiang County to make sure they get the same amount as before. Also, because the central government is giving a record high amount of money to local governments, Premier Cho Jung-tai will invite local leaders to talk about how responsibilities are shared between the central and local governments.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Finance announced how much tax money and other funds will be given to special municipalities and county governments for the year 2026. This was calculated using the new Public Finance Act formula. Looking at the detailed list of how the central government's general shared tax revenue is given to local governments, Taipei City will see a big increase from NT$70.702 billion this year to NT$114.924 billion next year. New Taipei City will also increase from NT$55.061 billion to NT$95.768 billion.</p>
            <p>Taichung City's amount will go up from NT$45.244 billion to NT$74.104 billion. Tainan City will increase from NT$32.721 billion to NT$49.670 billion. Kaohsiung City will go from NT$50.741 billion to NT$75.780 billion. Taoyuan City will increase from NT$36.275 billion to NT$65.285 billion. Lianjiang County, which people are watching closely, will have its difference covered to stay at NT$7.23 billion. However, some cities and counties, like Keelung City and Yunlin County, are not happy because the amount of shared tax money they received does not match what they calculated themselves.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said in a message to the media this evening that because of a problem with how the new Public Finance Act formula distributes money, some cities and counties will get a very large increase in their shared tax revenue. For example, if we don't include the NT$1 billion "subsidy for reduced financial business tax," Taipei City's shared tax revenue will increase by almost 65%. Even with the subsidy, the increase is still as high as 62.5%. In contrast, Lianjiang County's shared tax revenue for next year will actually decrease. So, the Ministry of Finance will add money to keep it the same level, making up for the difference.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih also said that next year, the central government will give a total of NT$884.09 billion in shared tax revenue to local governments. This is an increase of NT$416.51 billion compared to this year's NT$467.59 billion, which is almost a 90% increase. This amount makes up 31% of the central government's income. Also, the total money the central government gives to local governments next year will be the highest ever. Because of this, the central government has to look again at how responsibilities are divided between the central and local governments. Premier Cho Jung-tai is expected to invite leaders from all local governments to discuss this issue soon.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih added that today, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics also sent a letter to all special municipalities and county governments about "How General Subsidies from the Central Government to Special Municipalities and County Governments will be Distributed for 2026." The Directorate-General will also invite accounting staff from local governments soon to discuss how these funds will be distributed.</p>
