            <h1>US Lawmakers Accuse Chinese Power Bank Company Anker of Avoiding Taxes, Ask for Investigation</h1>
            <p>Important members of the US House of Representatives' committee on China have accused Anker. Anker is a big Chinese company that makes power banks and other electronic products. Lawmakers say Anker might be setting unfair prices and illegally avoiding US taxes on imported goods. They have asked the US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, to investigate Anker.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News saw a letter from September 19. In this letter, John Moolenaar, a Republican leader, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democratic leader, both from the House Select Committee on China, wrote to Secretary Lutnick. They asked him to tell the US Department of Commerce to look into what Anker is doing.</p>
            <p>The two lawmakers wrote in their letter that Anker uses several "illegal ways" to avoid US import taxes. For example, they might use wrong product codes. They also might send their goods through countries in Southeast Asia to illegally avoid paying taxes.</p>
            <p>They also said that Anker received at least 12 million US dollars (about 363 million New Taiwan Dollars) in help from the Chinese Communist Party in 2023. This help allowed Anker to "enter" the US market in an "unfair way."</p>
            <p>A former Google engineer started Anker. The company has many loyal customers in the US because its chargers and power banks are affordable. Apple, which makes iPhones, also sells many Anker products in its stores. This means Apple agrees that Anker's products meet Apple's quality standards.</p>
            <p>Anker said in an email that they have "started an internal check." They will also hire an American advisor to help find the facts and look at legal issues. After they finish these checks, they will give more information to the government and the public.</p>

            <h1>Keelung City: More Money Given, But Less Overall Income; Social Welfare Funds Might Not Be Enough</h1>
            <p>After changes to the law about how money is shared between the government levels, Keelung City expects to get about 1.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars less money. The city government said that this will affect education, basic city services, and social welfare. The biggest cut will be for costs to place people in care. The city might not have enough money for social welfare in the second half of next year.</p>
            <p>Today, Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang said that Keelung City will get about 7.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars more from shared taxes because of the new law. However, the total money the city gets will not increase; it will actually decrease. So far, the city only has 23.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is 1.7 billion less than last year's 25.4 billion.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hsieh explained that planned government help has changed its name to general help. Also, the general help that was calculated using a formula is now gone. Local governments now have to apply to different government departments for this help. Additionally, the amount of help given has been reduced, and local governments must pay more of their own money to match the funds they receive.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hsieh said that the city government really wants to do good work. They planned to spend about 30 billion New Taiwan Dollars next year, which is 3 billion more than this year. But they found out they will only get 23.7 billion. So, the city government will change next year's budget to still do what they planned. Mayor Hsieh said he felt like crying, but he knows crying won't help now.</p>
            <p>The city government said that because they don't have enough money, some school buildings that need urgent repairs will have to wait. They will build at least 5 fewer parking lots. Work on connecting homes to the sewage system will also slow down. There will be fewer projects to improve roads, and less money will be spent on fixing park facilities.</p>
            <p>For social welfare, the city government noted that the biggest cut is for the money used to place people in care. They might not have enough money for this in the second half of next year. Also, new social welfare plans that were supposed to start, like the 480-point trial program for elder care cards and new benefits for postpartum caregivers, cannot begin on time.</p>
            <p>Han Shih-yu, a Keelung City Councilor from the KMT party, said that Keelung City is changing right now. The city government hopes to make Keelung Port the biggest cruise ship home port in Taiwan. This needs money for advertising and many other basic services that need to be planned. He hopes the central government will continue to give money to support this.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuan-yu, an independent Keelung City Councilor, pointed out that the city government has not shown a complete plan for the future. However, they plan to spend over 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars on electric scooters for young people. This seems to be their most important plan for the next three years. He said that when making next year's budget, the city should be careful with spending and borrowing money.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuan-yu also said that developing tourism should not just be about having fireworks every three months. The city needs to truly promote "Keelung's 400th Anniversary." He also thinks the city should not spend 30 million New Taiwan Dollars on a Super Basketball League (SBL) team. The city must keep its promises and find sponsors to share the costs. Mayor Hsieh must make careful choices and avoid spending money on things that are only for a short time, like fireworks.</p>

            <h1>U16 Asian Cup Women's Basketball: Taiwan Starts Strong, Narrowly Beats South Korea in First Game</h1>
            <p>The U16 Asian Cup Women's Basketball tournament is happening in Malaysia. Today, the Taiwan team played its first game against South Korea. Taiwan almost lost, but Lin Nian-jen played very well, scoring the most points with 26. In the end, Taiwan won the exciting game 88 to 83, getting their first win in the tournament.</p>
            <p>The U16 Asian Cup Women's Basketball tournament started today. Eight teams are divided into two groups for the first round. The team that finishes first in each group will go directly to the semi-finals (top 4). Teams that finish second or third in their group must play an extra game to get into the semi-finals. Taiwan is in Group A with Australia, the Philippines, and South Korea. Their main goal is to be the best team in their group.</p>
            <p>Today, Taiwan's women's basketball team worked hard to win their first game against South Korea. In the first part of the game, both teams played very evenly. But in the second part, Taiwan scored a lot of points. Lin Nian-jen, Kao Tzu-chiao, and Chang Yu-tung, who are like "three musketeers," played together very well. They helped Taiwan score 35 points in that part of the game. At the same time, they only let South Korea score 11 points. So, Taiwan went into halftime with a 20-point lead.</p>
            <p>However, after halftime, Taiwan's team did not play as well. They could not stop South Korea from coming back strongly. Taiwan also missed several chances to score when they were open. This made the difference in scores less than ten points. Luckily, before the game ended, Lin Nian-jen made a key "three-point play" that secured the win for Taiwan. In the end, Taiwan won their first game by 5 points, which was a close call. Tomorrow, they will play against the Philippines.</p>
            <p>In this game, four players from the Taiwan team scored ten points or more. Lin Nian-jen scored the most points with 26, including three three-point shots, and also got 9 rebounds. Chang Yu-tung added 21 points and 8 rebounds. Kao Tzu-chiao had a great all-around game with 16 points, 7 assists, and 5 steals.</p>
