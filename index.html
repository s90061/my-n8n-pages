            <h1>電電公會拋海外園區構想 經長：產業對菲律賓有意願</h1>
            <p>The Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association (TEEMA) recently suggested creating science parks overseas. The Minister of Economic Affairs, Gong Ming-xin, said today that he recently went to a meeting in the Philippines. He visited industrial areas in Clark, North Luzon, with TEEMA and the Chinese National Federation of Industries. Taiwanese companies showed great interest in this idea.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-xin explained in an interview after a ministry meeting today that the Philippines is close to Taiwan, about 1.5 hours away by plane. He will share information about the local conditions and investment opportunities with companies.</p>
            <p>Regarding Europe, Gong Ming-xin said that TEEMA is looking at Poland. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has a trade service center in the Czech Republic. TSMC has a factory in Dresden, Germany. He hopes that when the TSMC factory in Germany starts working, it will encourage more companies to invest and build factories in the border area where Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic meet.</p>
            <p>For the Americas, Gong Ming-xin noted that Taiwanese companies are already investing in Mexico. In the future, they will also plan to set up operations in the United States, depending on the US Section 232 tariffs. For semiconductor manufacturing, the first choice is Arizona, where TSMC already has a factory. For electronic components, there are more options.</p>

            <h1>瑞典中間黨黨主席遭威脅辭職 學者警告對民主不利</h1>
            <p>Anna-Karin Hatt, the leader of Sweden's Centre Party, suddenly resigned on October 15. She said that constant threats and hate she received during her time as party leader made it hard for her to do her job normally. A Swedish expert pointed out that many politicians often receive threats, which makes them afraid to speak about certain issues or even leave politics. This is bad for how a democratic society works.</p>
            <p>Hatt's sudden and unexpected resignation as the Centre Party leader on October 15 surprised many in Swedish politics. She stated that since she became party leader six months ago, she has received many threats every day. This has greatly affected her personally and made her feel that she could not continue to work normally in the long term. It would also affect the work of the Centre Party, so she decided to resign.</p>
            <p>Hatt told Swedish television (SVT) that she did not want to describe in detail the threats and hate she received. She also said that her decision to resign was not due to a single event.</p>
            <p>She said that being a party leader in a more difficult and extreme society with intense public discussions was too much for her to handle. So, after looking at the situation, she decided to resign.</p>
            <p>She stated that many elected politicians, not just women, receive threats. This is a threat to democracy. In an extreme social atmosphere, many people are afraid to join politics. If this does not change, it will be hard to find democratic representatives in the future.</p>
            <p>Swedish television interviewed political expert Sandra Hakansson. Hakansson said that it was not surprising that Hatt received so many threats. Studies show that politicians today receive more threats than in the 2010s. The politicians who receive the most threats are usually those with higher political positions and who are more well-known.</p>
            <p>Among these, female politicians receive more threats than male politicians, and the methods of threat are also different. Threats and harassment against male politicians usually focus on their policies or positions. However, threats against female politicians are often personal and frequently involve sexist harassment.</p>
            <p>Hakansson also said that the popularity of social media is one reason for the increase in threats. She mentioned that social media is an important tool for politicians today. Many people believe it is good to be present on different social media platforms.</p>
            <p>Her research also found that people who threaten politicians and spread hate speech are usually not other politicians or criminals. Instead, they are ordinary citizens who send these threats and hate messages using their regular emails and social media accounts.</p>
            <p>She said that hate and threats against politicians are bad for democracy because many politicians she interviewed said they would choose not to comment publicly on certain issues or join related debates. Some even choose not to work on promoting these issues.</p>
            <p>Issues that politicians usually avoid include immigration and integration, gender equality, and violence against women.</p>
            <p>She believes that from a democratic point of view, this is very serious. This is because voters need to know what politicians think about various issues. These threats can also cause many people to choose not to take part in public affairs.</p>
