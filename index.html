            <h1>Trump Says U.S. Sunk Three Ships Off Venezuela</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump said today that the United States has "sunk" a total of three ships near Venezuela. The day before, he had confirmed that the U.S. launched a second deadly attack on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a state visit to the UK: "We actually sank three ships, not two. You only saw two."</p>
            <p>Trump did not give more details about the third ship or if more people died.</p>
            <p>On September 15, Trump said U.S. forces hit a second ship in international waters, killing three people. Trump called them "drug trafficker terrorists."</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, the U.S. military attacked suspected drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea, and 11 people died. After these attacks, people have often questioned if the Trump government's actions were legal.</p>
            <p>The U.S. government released videos of the two previous known actions. They said they had strong evidence that all the people who died were smugglers trying to bring deadly drugs into the U.S.</p>
            <p>However, the U.S. did not provide details to support these claims.</p>
            <p>These actions by the U.S. military have made the situation more tense in the Caribbean area. The U.S. has sent many navy ships to this area. This has made some people think that Washington might want to remove the government in Venezuela.</p>
