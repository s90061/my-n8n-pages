            <h1>UN Warns: Gaza Disaster Could Be Like Past Famines in Africa</h1>
            <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said today that the disaster happening in Gaza is like the famines that happened in Ethiopia and Biafra in Nigeria in the 20th century.</p>
            <p>Ross Smith, the emergency director for the WFP, told reporters in Geneva, "We have not seen a situation like this in this century."</p>
            <p>He spoke from Rome via video and said, "This reminds us of the terrible events in Ethiopia and Biafra in the last century."</p>
            <p>"We need to act very quickly now," he added.</p>
            <p>Before his comments, a group called the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned today that "the most serious famine is happening in the Gaza Strip." This group sets global standards to decide how bad food crises are.</p>
            <p>UN organizations use IPC to check how many people are not getting enough food. The IPC team strongly stated that getting "immediate and free" humanitarian help into Gaza is the only way to stop "hunger and deaths" from quickly increasing.</p>
            <p>Smith said, "The disaster is happening right in front of our eyes, on our TV screens."</p>
            <p>"This is not just a warning; it is a call for action," he explained.</p>
            <p>After talks for a ceasefire failed, Israel completely blocked Gaza on March 2. Only in late May, after warnings about the risk of famine, did Israel start to let small amounts of aid enter again.</p>
            <p>The IPC team said that the newest information shows "most parts of the Gaza Strip" have reached the "famine level."</p>

            <h1>Japanese Official: Japan-US Trade Deal Gives Japan Lowest Taxes on Chips and Medicine</h1>
            <p>Akazawa Ryosei, a Japanese minister in charge of trade talks with the US, said today that a trade agreement made last week will give Japan the lowest tax rates on computer chips and medicines sent to the US. These rates will be the same as the lowest rates agreed upon by Trump with any other country.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Akazawa Ryosei stated at a press conference, "If another country and the US agree on a lower tax rate for chips and medicines, then that lower rate will also be used for Japan."</p>
            <p>According to the Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington, Akazawa Ryosei and his team worked to get a special protection in earlier US-Japan trade talks. This protection is for taxes on medicines and chips that the US plans to put in place under "Section 232."</p>
            <p>Section 232 comes from a law called the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It lets the US President put limits on imported goods if it is for national security.</p>
            <p>This protection is like "most favored nation" status. It makes sure that Japan will get the same lowest industry tax rates, even if other countries agree to lower tax rates with the US.</p>
            <p>Last week, Japan and the US finished their trade agreement. The US will lower taxes on Japanese goods like cars to 15%. Japan will invest 550 billion US dollars in the US. This money includes buying company shares, giving loans, and offering guarantees.</p>

            <h1>President Lai Visits Disaster Center, Speaks with 4 City Leaders About Damage</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te went to the Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center this afternoon. He talked with Mayor Huang Wei-che of Tainan, County Magistrate Weng Chang-liang of Chiayi, Mayor Chen Chi-mai of Kaohsiung, and County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi of Pingtung. He asked about the damage in their areas and told the center's staff to stay at their posts. He asked them to work fully with the disaster response plan to keep people safe.</p>
            <p>Because of a strong southwest air current and a low-pressure area, the weather agency continues to warn about heavy rain. They expect the southwest air current to bring rain clouds tonight. The rain will move from the coast to inland areas, and there might be very heavy rain or more in the south.</p>
            <p>The Presidential Office sent out a press release this evening. When President Lai visited the Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center this afternoon, he said that the government's purpose is to solve people's problems. It should help people rebuild their homes quickly. The central government and local governments should work together to continue building water systems. This is to prepare for how climate change will affect different parts of Taiwan in the future.</p>
            <p>The President pointed out that from the reports and video calls, it is clear that all government departments and local governments worked well together during this heavy rain. They handled different disaster situations quickly and effectively. However, because of the southwest air current, rain is expected to continue for several days. He asked everyone to keep working and try to make the disaster's effects on people as small as possible.</p>
            <p>The President said that Premier Cho Jung-tai visited cities like Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan this morning to understand the disaster situation. To help these areas rebuild faster, he will ask Political Advisor Chen Chin-te to lead a forward command post for disaster recovery in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan. Advisor Lee Meng-yen will also help. Departments like the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, and the Public Construction Commission will be part of this group. The first meeting is planned for tomorrow morning in Tainan. He asked all related agencies to work hard on the rebuilding efforts.</p>
            <p>The President said that the government's purpose is to solve problems for its people. He asked everyone to be creative and use their abilities. For example, the central government and local governments can work together to arrange for companies that usually do central government projects to help with rebuilding first. He said they should act directly and think about the affected people, helping them rebuild their homes quickly. This will prevent worse damage if another typhoon or heavy rain comes. The central government will also help with money.</p>
            <p>The President noted that Taiwan often has natural disasters. Over many years, it has built up strength to deal with them and has overcome many challenges. But climate change is happening quickly. He asked the Executive Yuan and local governments to keep working on water system projects. This is to prepare for the effects of climate change on all parts of Taiwan in the future. He hopes everyone works together to make people feel safe.</p>
            <p>The Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a press release that during today's video meeting, the four county mayors reported on flood damage in their areas. They also talked about how many people were moved because of mudslide warnings, damage to farms, and help from the military for cleaning up. They especially praised the Water Resources Agency for its work in flood control.</p>
