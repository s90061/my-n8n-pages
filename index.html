            <h1>Fed Board Member Cook Ignores Trump's Firing Order, Says He Has No Such Power</h1>
            <p>Lisa Cook, a member of the US Federal Reserve Board, today pushed back against an unusual move by US President Trump to remove her from her job. She said that Trump does not have the legal right to interfere with an independent body like the Federal Reserve in this way.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Trump had asked Cook to resign last week. Then, last night, he posted on his social media site, "Truth Social," saying he had fired her "effective immediately." He mentioned accusations that Cook had given false information about mortgage contracts.</p>
            <p>Today, Cook released a statement through her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, to AFP. She said, "I will not resign. President Trump says he fired me 'for good cause,' but legally, there is no good cause, and he does not have the power to do this."</p>
            <p>Lowell promised that they would "take all necessary steps to stop his (Trump's) illegal actions."</p>
            <p>According to US federal law, Federal Reserve officials can only be removed if there is "good cause." This usually means they have done something wrong or have not done their job properly. </p>
            <p>Recently, the US Supreme Court, with most judges being conservative, allowed Trump to fire members of other independent government bodies. However, their decision clearly stated that the Federal Reserve was an exception. (Translated by Chang Cheng-chien) 1140826</p>

            <h1>Chang Chao-yuan Hits Home Run, Wins MVP; Should Be More Careful About Glove Position to Avoid Interference</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Steel Hawks catcher Chang Chao-yuan hit his 8th home run of the season today. He got 2 hits and 2 RBIs, helping his team beat the Fubon Guardians 4 to 1. He was named MVP. He joked that to get out of his slump, he let his teammate Shih Tzu-chien "scold" him a bit. For hitting interference, he believes he can be more careful about where his glove is.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hawks played against the Guardians. Chang Chao-yuan started as catcher and batted 8th. In the top of the 2nd inning, he hit a solo home run, which put his team ahead. In the top of the 5th inning, he hit another single that brought in a run. In total, he had 2 hits in 4 at-bats and got 2 RBIs.</p>
            <p>When Chang Chao-yuan was catching in the bottom of the 2nd inning, Guardians batter Chen Kai-yu's bat hit Chang's glove. This was ruled as hitting interference, and the batter went to first base. Hawks manager Hong I-chung went to check what happened. After the game, Hong I-chung said that the umpire explained it was within the batter's swing area. However, it felt like the batter didn't really swing; the bat just went down and hit the glove directly. But since the umpire made the call, they had to accept it.</p>
            <p>Chang Chao-yuan said that at the moment, he felt he caught the ball first, and then his glove was hit. To change this, he needs to be more careful not to put his glove out too far in the future.</p>
            <p>Chang Chao-yuan hit a home run after almost a month. He said he is not a player who tries to hit home runs. He also joked that when he was not hitting well before, he talked to his older teammate, pitcher Shih Tzu-chien. After Shih "scolded" him a bit, he hit a home run. So, when he was not playing well recently, he went to Shih Tzu-chien again and "asked him to scold me."</p>
            <p>Chang Chao-yuan said that during his home run at-bat in the top of the 2nd inning, he focused on the timing. The pitcher got ahead with good pitches, so when he saw a ball he could hit, he swung hard without thinking too much. He had not hit a home run in a long time and had not helped the team much in a while, so he was happy to play well. (Edited by Fang Pei-ching) 1140826</p>

            <h1>Pacific Island Students Come to Taiwan for Training, Inviting Indigenous Youth to Join for More Diplomatic Energy</h1>
            <p>Twenty-three students from different countries have come to Taiwan for the "Pacific Islands Young Leaders Training Program." This year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has invited three young Taiwanese Indigenous people to join the full program in both the US and Taiwan. This will bring new energy to Taiwan's diplomacy and cultural ties with Austronesian countries. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ko Pao-hsuan, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said Taiwan can help with regional safety and will continue to support Pacific Island nations.</p>
            <p>MOFA announced today that it is working with the "East-West Center" (EWC), a think tank in Hawaii, USA, to hold the 10th "Pacific Islands Young Leaders Training Program" (PILP) in 2025. The program started on the afternoon of August 25th at MOFA's Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs. The 23 students this year come from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, Tuvalu, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Fiji, the Kingdom of Tonga, the Cook Islands, and French Polynesia.</p>
            <p>MOFA explained that this year, they are working with the Council of Indigenous Peoples to invite three young Taiwanese Indigenous people to take part in the full training program in Hawaii, USA, and Taiwan. This aims to bring new energy to Taiwan's Austronesian diplomacy and cultural connections. The program includes topics such as international relations, regional security, environmental sustainability, medical cooperation, and Austronesian studies. The students will also stay overnight in an Indigenous village in Majia Township, Pingtung County.</p>
            <p>MOFA stated that Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ko Pao-hsuan led the opening ceremony on behalf of Political Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs, Wu Chih-chung. Guests who gave speeches included Tuvalu Ambassador to Taiwan Lily Tangisia Faavae, Deputy Chief of Mission of the Republic of the Marshall Islands Cassailis Jarom, Deputy Director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT/T) Karin Lang, and EWC Pacific Islands Development Program Project Director Mary Therese Perez Hattori. Officials from the Australian Office and the Hawaii State Government Office in Taipei also attended.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Ko Pao-hsuan pointed out that Taiwanese Indigenous people and Pacific Island people share many similarities in weaving, tattoos, and food. This shows their deep connections. MOFA not only makes partnerships stronger through different types of cooperation but also promotes cultural exchange. Pacific Island nations and Taiwan both face regional tensions and the climate change crisis. Taiwan has the ability and determination to help with regional safety. It also wants to continue helping Pacific Island nations with building skills, environmental protection, and democratic governance.</p>
            <p>Faavae said that Pacific countries are working together to face big threats like rising sea levels and are making regional cooperation stronger in the current political situation. Jarom thanked Taiwan for supporting development in the Pacific region and stressed how important this cooperation is for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
            <p>Lang emphasized that Taiwan is a global leader in democratic governance, public health, and high-tech industries like semiconductors and AI. As a Pacific country, the United States always puts the Indo-Pacific region at the center of its foreign policy. It continues to encourage trade, investment, and business exchange. Especially, the "Global Cooperation and Training Framework" (GCTF) has shown its promise for regional strength and cooperation in areas like disaster response, public health, and cybersecurity. She hopes that the connections students make in Taiwan will make cooperation among Pacific Island nations, Taiwan, and the United States stronger, leading to peace and safety in the region.</p>
            <p>Mary said that the most valuable thing in society today is not money, but long-term relationships. The PILP, organized by EWC and MOFA, is an important platform to help build a network and unity among regional leaders, and to help countries develop talented future leaders.</p>
            <p>MOFA also said that for this ceremony, the Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs specially invited students from the "Indigenous Class" of Shulin High School in New Taipei City to perform Indigenous songs. They sang and danced with the guests, showing the idea that "everyone is a diplomat." (Edited by Su Lung-chi) 1140826</p>
