            <h1>Czech Election: President Pavel Says Keep Country Safe from Russia</h1>
            <p>On October 2, Czech President Petr Pavel gave a speech on TV in Prague. He talked about the upcoming election for the Czech Parliament. He said this election is very important. Now, more than ever, the country needs a government that can keep it safe and independent. This government must not let the Czech Republic be controlled by Russia.</p>
            <p>Pavel gave his speech on Czech TV three days before the parliamentary election. It lasted about five minutes. He said that before almost every election, people say it's a big turning point, the most important election in the country's history. He didn't want to say that, but he agreed this election is very important. This is because the security situation in Europe and the world is getting worse. Also, many things we used to be sure about are now disappearing.</p>
            <p>He stressed that the Czech Republic needs a government that can always keep the country safe. Today, the Czech Republic is safe because it is a strong member of the European Union (EU) and NATO. "We need a government that protects our independence within the group of democratic countries. It should not let us be controlled by Russia or by Russia's efforts to get power back in Central and Eastern Europe. If that happens, it would deeply affect our freedom, safety, and money."</p>
            <p>He also said that after the votes are counted, he will respect what the voters decide. When forming a new government, he will follow the rules in the country's constitution. "I will work hard to create a stable and strong government. I will ask the next prime minister not to put our safety at risk."</p>
            <p>He also said that he is not the final "savior." He will not change the election results for any side or save any side. The voters will make the final decision about who will be in the next government.</p>
            <p>Pavel asked people who have not decided to vote yet to please go and vote. Pavel said that some people might feel there is no perfect choice. Every choice might have something they don't like. This is because the world is not perfect. We cannot expect one political party or person to meet all our hopes. We can only choose the best option available.</p>
            <p>Pavel also said that if voters don't like some of the main candidates on the list, they should use their vote to choose someone else. If people do not vote, it means they are letting other people decide for them, even about their own lives.</p>
            <p>Also, Pavel spoke against rumors on social media before the election. These rumors said that the election results would be rigged. He said that the election process is fair and clear. Hundreds of thousands of citizens, chosen by different political parties, directly take part in and watch over the election committee.</p>
            <p>Finally, Pavel thanked the people of the Czech Republic for voting. He said they were "doing their part for our country, our democracy, our freedom, and our safety."</p>

            <h1>Manchester Synagogue Attack: Police Say Attacker Was a British Citizen from Syria</h1>
            <p>On October 2, a deadly attack happened at a synagogue in Manchester, UK. Police have said it was a terror attack. They also announced that the attacker was a 35-year-old British citizen from Syria.</p>
            <p>This morning, outside a synagogue in Manchester, a car drove strangely and then hit a group of people. The driver then got out and used a knife to attack and hurt people walking by.</p>
            <p>The synagogue guards and some people inside worked together to stop the attacker. Because of this, the attacker could not enter the synagogue and cause more harm. However, two Jewish people died in the attack, and four others were seriously hurt. They are now in the hospital.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Greater Manchester Police later released a statement. They said the male attacker's name was Jihad Al-Shamie. The police shot and killed him.</p>
            <p>Police also said that three other people were arrested. They are thought to have asked for, planned, or encouraged terror actions. These include two men in their thirties and one woman in her sixties.</p>
            <p>After an urgent meeting about the Manchester attack, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer gave a statement at his office. He said that a hateful person carried out a terror attack against Jewish people, just because they were Jewish. He promised to do everything he can to keep the Jewish community in the UK safe. This includes putting more police around Jewish places and buildings.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, said that Israel feels sad with the Jewish community in the UK.</p>
            <p>He said, "Our thoughts are with the families of those who died. We hope those who are hurt get better soon. I warned at the United Nations (UN) that being weak against terrorism only brings more terrorism. Only strength and working together can defeat it."</p>
            <p>Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said he was "shocked" by the event. He also said that crimes against religious groups are "very bad."</p>
            <p>Turk wrote on X, a social media platform, "Freedom of religion or belief is very important for all of us as humans. We must protect it."</p>

            <h1>Israel Stops Aid Ships Going to Gaza; Protests Happen Around the World</h1>
            <p>On October 2, news from Barcelona and Rome said that Israeli soldiers stopped a group of aid ships going to Gaza. After this, many protests happened around the world today to support Palestinians. In Europe, protesters blocked roads and broke windows in shops.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that armed Israeli soldiers got onto about 40 ships. These ships were trying to break through Israel's sea blockade to deliver aid to Gaza. The soldiers arrested over 400 foreign people who supported Palestinians, including Greta Thunberg, a young environmental activist from Sweden. Because of this, many countries around the world are criticizing Israel.</p>
            <p>In Barcelona, a big city in Spain, protesters broke windows of shops and restaurants. They also sprayed anti-Israel messages on them. Stores like Starbucks, Burger King, and Carrefour were damaged. The protesters said these companies helped Israel in its attacks on Gaza.</p>
            <p>Akram Azahomaras, who was at the protest, said, "These protests are the only thing we can do." But she also thought that breaking shops would not help. "We need to protest peacefully, using words, not violence."</p>
            <p>In Italy, videos showed students taking over university campuses, such as Milan University and Rome University. They also used car tires to block the entrance to Bologna University. News reports said that hundreds of people in Turin blocked the city's ring road.</p>
            <p>In Rome, medical workers and pharmacists planned a quick protest called a flash mob. The organizers said they would turn on flashlights and phone lights. At the same time, they would read out the names of 1,677 medical workers who died in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Italian worker unions asked for a general strike to support the Gaza aid ships. More than 100 marches or meetings are planned across the country.</p>
            <p>However, Italy's Defense Minister, Guido Crosetto, criticized some protesters for causing trouble. He wrote on X, a social media platform: "Does anyone really believe that blocking a train station, an airport, a highway, or destroying a shop in Italy will bring comfort to the Palestinian people?"</p>
            <p>Besides these cities, thousands of protesters also went to the streets in Dublin, Ireland; Paris, France; Berlin, Germany; and Geneva, Switzerland. They all spoke against Israel stopping the aid ships.</p>
            <p>Similar gatherings also took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mexico City, Mexico; Karachi, Pakistan; and Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic group that controls Gaza, attacked Israel. After this, Israel began to attack Gaza.</p>
            <p>Israel reported that Hamas's attack killed about 1,200 people. Also, 251 people were taken as hostages back to Gaza. However, Palestinian authorities say that the war in Gaza has caused over 66,000 deaths.</p>
