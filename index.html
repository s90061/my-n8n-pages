            <h1>Trump Says Companies Should Report Finances Every Six Months, Not Every Three Months</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 15th (CNA) â€“ US President Trump posted on his social media platform, "Truth Social," today. He said that American companies should not release their financial reports every three months. Instead, they should give them every six months. He believes this will save money.</p>
            <p>On "Truth Social," Trump wrote that if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agrees, companies should not have to share financial reports every three months. They should share them every six months instead.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "This will save money and let managers focus on running their companies well." He also mentioned, "Companies in China plan for 50 to 100 years. But we run our companies based on every three months."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Trump had this idea before, during his first time as president. He wanted companies to change from quarterly reports to half-yearly reports.</p>

            <h1>US and China Agree on Plan for TikTok, Says US Treasury Head</h1>
            <p>Madrid, September 15th (CNA) â€“ The United States and China finished two days of talks about taxes and money rules in Madrid, Spain, today. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that both countries have made a basic agreement for TikTok. TikTok is a popular short video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that TikTok might be stopped in the US as early as September 17th. This would happen if the company did not change who owns it to an American owner. So, this agreement means TikTok can keep working in the US.</p>
            <p>Bessent told reporters, "This plan is for TikTok to be owned and controlled by Americans." He did not share more details.</p>
            <p>US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said that the deadline for TikTok might be moved back a little to finish this agreement.</p>
            <p>Bessent said clearly that if there was no basic agreement, the deadline would not be moved.</p>
            <p>He also said that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will talk on September 19th.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, the US had said it would stop TikTok on time. This was unless China agreed to not ask for lower taxes and fewer rules on technology in exchange for changing TikTok's ownership.</p>
            <p>Bessent also said that the US and China will probably have more talks about trade and money rules in a few days. He noted that they are also talking about how to work together to stop money laundering and the illegal drug fentanyl in trade.</p>

            <h1>India and US Officials to Meet for Trade Talks, Aim to Solve Tax Problems</h1>
            <p>Mumbai, September 15th (CNA) â€“ India and the United States want to fix problems with import taxes. Indian news reports say that officials from both countries will meet tomorrow in New Delhi, India's capital, to talk about trade.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reports that India has the most people in the world. Many products sent from India to the US have high taxes. India and the US have not yet made a trade agreement to make these taxes lower.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump believes that selling energy gives Russia a lot of money for its war in Ukraine. Last month, to put pressure on Russia, he decided to raise taxes on Indian products to 50%. This was to punish India for continuing to buy oil from Russia. This also made the relationship between India and the US more difficult.</p>
            <p>Even so, leaders from both the US and India have recently said they still want to keep talking and negotiating.</p>
            <p>According to "The Indian Express" newspaper, Rajesh Agarwal, an official from India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, said in a meeting today that Indian and US officials will meet tomorrow to talk about trade.</p>
            <p>NDTV (New Delhi Television) said that Brendan Lynch, the Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asian Affairs, is part of the American group.</p>
            <p>The report also said that this meeting is just a first step before a full round of talks happens later.</p>
