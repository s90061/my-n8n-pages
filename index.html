A recent report suggests that even short walks can greatly improve your health. Experts say that adding just 10 minutes of walking to your daily routine can have many positive effects. This is good news for people who find it hard to exercise for long periods.
Walking regularly helps to strengthen your heart and improves blood flow. It can also help you manage your weight and lower your risk of serious health problems like heart disease and diabetes. Beyond physical benefits, walking is known to boost your mood and reduce stress. It can make you feel more energetic and even improve your sleep quality.
The report highlights that consistency is key. Even if you cannot walk for long, short, regular walks are much better than no activity at all. So, next time you have a few free minutes, consider taking a short walk to improve your overall well-being.

**AI Is Making Jobs More Productive, Not Just Replacing Them, Study Finds**

New research suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the workplace by making jobs more productive, rather than simply replacing workers. A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford University looked at how AI affects different roles.
The research found that AI tools often help employees do their jobs better and faster. For example, AI can handle repetitive or simple tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative work. This means that instead of AI taking jobs, it can act as a powerful assistant, improving efficiency and output.
However, the study also notes that some jobs might still be at risk, especially those that involve very basic, predictable tasks. But for many roles, AI seems to be creating new ways of working, where human skills are combined with machine intelligence. Companies are now looking at how to best use AI to support their teams and boost productivity.

**Sustainable Travel: More Europeans Choose Trains Over Flights**

A new trend shows that more and more travelers in Europe are choosing trains instead of planes for their journeys. This shift is part of a growing interest in sustainable travel, where people try to reduce their negative impact on the environment.
Train travel is seen as a more environmentally friendly option compared to flying because it produces much less carbon pollution per passenger. As awareness about climate change grows, many people are looking for greener ways to explore.
Across Europe, there has been an increase in night train services and new high-speed rail routes. Travel companies are also reporting a higher demand for train tickets, especially for longer distances. This trend suggests that travelers are willing to spend more time on their journey if it means traveling in a way that is better for the planet. The movement towards slower, greener travel is becoming a significant part of the European tourism industry.
