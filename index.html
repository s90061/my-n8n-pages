            <h1>School Shooting in Northeast Brazil: Two Teenagers Killed</h1>
            <p>A shooting happened today in the parking lot of a school in Sobral, a town in Ceara state, northeast Brazil. Two teenagers died from bullet wounds, and three other people were hurt.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Ceara state government said in a statement that "the attackers shot on the school sidewalk, and bullets hit the victims in the school parking lot." It also said, "One victim was found with some drugs, a precise electronic scale, and packaging materials on them."</p>
            <p>Police sources told AFP reporters that there was more than one shooter, and they rode motorcycles.</p>
            <p>The governor of Ceara state, Elmano de Freitas, wrote on social media platform X. He said he was "very sad" about this "unacceptable" violent event. He also said he has told the police to send more officers to the area where it happened to "find the criminals."</p>
            <p>In recent years, drug gangs have quickly grown stronger in the poor northeast part of Brazil. Brazil is now dealing with more and more gang fights.</p>

            <h1>European Stocks Fall; Investors Wait for Important US Inflation Data</h1>
            <p>Today, most stock markets around the world went down. Even though new information showed that the U.S. economy grew more than expected, the three main stock markets in Europe closed lower. Investors are now waiting for important inflation information from the U.S., which will be released later this week.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the U.S. government announced today that the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for the second quarter of this year was changed. It went up from 3.3% to 3.8% when calculated yearly. This happened because people spent more money than expected.</p>
            <p>However, experts are mostly looking at the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. This is the inflation measure that the Federal Reserve (Fed) prefers, and it will be released tomorrow. Also, people are paying close attention to the non-farm payroll report, which will come out next week.</p>
            <p>In London, the FTSE 100 index dropped by 36.45 points, which is 0.39%. It closed at 9213.98 points.</p>
            <p>In Frankfurt, the DAX index went down by 131.98 points, or 0.56%. It closed at 23534.83 points.</p>
            <p>In Paris, the CAC 40 index fell by 32.03 points, which is 0.41%. It closed at 7795.42 points.</p>

            <h1>Abbas Speaks at UN: Hamas Will Not Govern Gaza After War</h1>
            <p>Today, Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, spoke to the United Nations General Assembly through a video. He said that the Palestinian people are against the armed group Hamas attacking Israel in 2023. He also promised that after the war ends, Hamas will not be part of governing the Gaza Strip and must give up its weapons.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Abbas spoke in a pre-recorded video to the UN General Assembly. He said that Palestinians in the Gaza Strip "have faced a war of genocide, destruction, hunger, and being forced to leave their homes, started by Israel."</p>
            <p>Abbas stated that the Palestinian authorities "are against" Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. He added that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p>Abbas also explained his idea for how the Palestinian territories should be governed after the Israel-Hamas war. He said that the Palestinian Authority "is ready to take on full responsibility for governance and security."</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that "Hamas will not be involved in governing" and must give its weapons to the Palestinian authorities.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Abbas welcomed the recent announcements from France, the United Kingdom, and Canada about recognizing a Palestinian state. He asked other countries that have not yet recognized it to do the same.</p>
            <p>He also said, "We announce that we are ready to work with U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia, France, the United Nations, and all partners to put into action the peace plan supported by the UN General Assembly."</p>
            <p>Finally, Abbas said that even though the war is very hard, the Palestinian people "will not leave our homes."</p>
