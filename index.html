            <h1>Ministry of Transportation Helps People Fix Their Homes by Connecting Them with Companies</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and southwest air currents have caused serious damage to homes in southern Taiwan. The Ministry of Transportation said today that it has asked different departments to connect people with companies. This is because there is a shortage of workers and materials right now. The ministry hopes to help residents find workers to repair their homes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation posted on Facebook today that Vice Minister Chen Yen-po held a meeting yesterday. They talked about the progress of repairs in the Tainan disaster area and what to do next. They have already visited over 100 damaged homes. They are still looking for more people and resources to help residents rebuild their homes quickly.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that there is a shortage of workers and materials, so people cannot find workers to fix their homes. They also don't have enough people or tools. The government has asked all ministries to help. Each ministry is responsible for certain areas. The Ministry of Transportation is responsible for Xinying District, Yanshui District, Baihe District, and Houbi District in Tainan City.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that people who need to fix their homes can first register with their district chief. The Ministry of Transportation will then help connect residents with companies. After that, residents and companies will talk and sign a simple contract. The Ministry of Transportation only helps to connect them; it does not pay for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To speed up the rebuilding process after the disaster, the Ministry of Transportation also set some rules for action. Besides connecting people with companies, they will fix old, one-story houses and homes with roofs blown off first, as these need immediate help. Asbestos tiles and other waste materials will be collected in one place. The district office will then help clear them away.</p>
