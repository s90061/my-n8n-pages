            <p>Lin Chih-sheng, a famous baseball player who just retired, was invited to the Golden Bell Awards to give the "Most Popular Variety Show Award." He said he was honored to be on the Golden Bell stage after being on the baseball field. He also joked that he hopes to be on the Golden Bell stage again for a sports show in the future. He explained that variety show hosts are like baseball players: they both work hard to make the audience feel something. He added that this award is an honor for the TV show team and deserves applause from the audience.</p>
            <p>The actress Barbie Hsu (Hsueh Hsi-yuan) passed away earlier this year. During today's ceremony, old clips of her lively hosting were shown. The ceremony also remembered writer Wang Hao-yi, cartoonist Yu Fu, and fortune teller Bu Yang, among others. The speaker, Liu Ke-hsiang, said with emotion that every star has a special light that connects people. Tonight, everyone looked at the bright light of these stars again.</p>
            <p>Dee Hsu (Hsueh Hsi-ti) and Kevin Tsai brought back their show "Kangxi Coming" at the 60th Golden Bell Awards. They also gave out an award. Kevin Tsai asked everyone to cheer for Dee Hsu and give her strength.</p>
            <p>Dee Hsu said she was there today because her older sister, Barbie Hsu, would have really wanted her to be there. She also said that her heart still felt empty and she still wanted to call Barbie Hsu. "Thank you to my family and friends for giving me a lot of strength, which is why I am standing here," she said.</p>
            <p>Dee Hsu also sang a song that Barbie Hsu wrote and spoke to her sister in heaven with a lot of feeling: "Life without you will be very hard, but I will keep moving forward." The deep love between the sisters made many people in the audience cry.</p>
            <p>Dee Hsu and Patrick won the "Variety Show Host Award" for their show "Miss Buxidi." Dee Hsu cried as she took the award from Kevin Tsai. She said, "I want to give this award to my mother. My mom said she has a big hole in her heart, and if I won an award today, maybe that hole would be filled a little. Mom, put this award with Barbie Hsu's picture, and your hole might be filled."</p>
            <p>Patrick said that he dreamed of being a host more than 10 years ago. He never thought that today he would win an award with the person who first asked him what he wanted to do, which was Dee Hsu.</p>
            <p>Lulu, Ken Lin, and Jacky Wu were nominated for the "Variety Show Host Award" for the 60th Golden Bell Awards with their show "Hot Door Night." Lulu was also nominated with her ex-boyfriend Ada and Beautiful as Herself for "Night Market King." Even though they didn't win, Lulu sat between Ada and Ken Lin at the awards. This made Lulu laugh nervously and say, "Meeting again means we are meant to be." She joked about her past and current colleagues in a funny and open way.</p>
