            <h1>US Allows EDA Sales, China Approves Synopsys Deal</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 15 (CNA) â€“ The United States recently allowed the sale of chip design software (EDA) to China again. Yesterday, China approved a US$35 billion deal for a big US EDA company, Synopsys, to buy another company. However, China added some rules. For example, Synopsys cannot stop its current Chinese customers from renewing their contracts.</p>
            <p>Synopsys plans to buy Ansys, a company that makes simulation software, for US$35 billion (about NT$1.03 trillion). This is a very big deal in the tech world in recent years. But the deal had been waiting for approval from Chinese authorities for a long time.</p>
            <p>According to reports from Chinese media like Finance World and Securities Times, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced on July 14 that it approved Synopsys' plan to buy Ansys shares. The approval came with added rules.</p>
            <p>Reports say that China's approval is a big win for Synopsys. This company is seen as important for the US to keep its strong position in certain areas of semiconductor technology.</p>
            <p>Before this, on July 2, the US government told Synopsys that it had removed the need for export licenses to sell EDA to China. Synopsys said that after the US relaxed its rules, the company is working to let its Chinese customers use its products again.</p>
            <p>In its announcement, SAMR listed 8 extra rules. These include: Synopsys must not end contracts with existing customers; it must not refuse requests from Chinese customers to renew existing contracts; it must sell its EDA products and Ansys' EDA products to Chinese customers fairly, reasonably, and without discrimination. These products are mainly used for analyzing things like parasitic effects, power use at the transistor level, and power devices.</p>
            <p>In May, it was reported that the US government was stopping Synopsys and its rivals from working with Chinese customers. This was for national security reasons.</p>
            <p>Reports say that with China's decision, Synopsys has overcome the last main problem in strengthening its position in the market. The deal, which was announced in early 2024, had already been approved by regulators in Europe and the US.</p>
            <p>When the New York stock market opened on Monday, Synopsys' stock price went up by 3.5% at one point. Ansys' stock price rose by 5.6% at one point. (Edited by Yang Sheng-ju / Chiu Kuo-chiang) 1140715</p>

            <h1>General Manager Qualifications: Taiwan Railways Says It Will Follow Law and Ensure Professionalism</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 15 (CNA) â€“ The board of directors for Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) wanted to change its rules. They wanted to add that the general manager must have real-world experience in managing railways. But the Ministry of Transportation said this went beyond what the law allows. Today, the TRA board decided to keep the original rules. This means they will follow the Administrative Procedure Act and continue to ensure the general manager has a professional background, as required by law.</p>
            <p>Regarding the requirements for the TRA general manager, TRA stated today in a written explanation that according to Article 11 of the company's establishment rules, TRA should have one general manager. This person must have professional experience in transportation or business management.</p>
            <p>TRA explained that on January 24, 2024, and October 22, 2024, the first board meetings approved a plan to change Article 15, Section 2 of TRA's company rules. They wanted to add that the general manager must have "railway" operating and management experience.</p>
            <p>TRA said that the Ministry of Transportation stated that adding the word "railway" would create a new restriction not in the original law. This would go beyond what the law allows. So, based on Article 150, Section 2 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which says that rules must clearly state their legal basis and not go beyond what the law permits, the original text should remain.</p>
            <p>TRA said that regarding the proposed change to Article 15, Section 2 of the company rules, the board decided today to keep the original rules. They will follow the Administrative Procedure Act and continue to ensure the general manager has a professional background. This is to develop a strong state-owned railway business, increase national wealth, help the economy grow, and make people's lives easier.</p>
            <p>However, the Taiwan Railway Labor Union expressed strong concern and firm opposition to this decision. They asked the board to listen to the workers, change this decision, and start talks between workers and management.</p>
            <p>The union said that railway businesses are very public and need a lot of special knowledge. The general manager's job affects all employees' rights and passenger safety. So, there should be a certain level of professional experience required. This is to make sure the person can correctly understand how the company is running and manage railway tasks well. If the person does not have relevant professional experience, it might affect the quality of decisions. This could then put train safety and the company's future at risk.

            <h1>Mercuries Life Insurance Lost NT$230 Million in First Half, Approved to Add NT$17.6 Billion to Foreign Exchange Reserve</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 15 (CNA) â€“ Mercuries Life Insurance today shared its financial results for the first half of the year. Due to issues with US tariffs, the New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger against the US Dollar in the first half of the year, increasing by NT$2.879. This caused losses from currency exchange, affecting profits. In the first half of this year, the company lost NT$230 million in total. The loss per share after tax was NT$0.04. In June, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) approved the company to add about NT$17.64 billion to its foreign exchange fluctuation reserve.</p>
            <p>Mercuries Life Insurance today announced its financial results for the first half of the year. The FSC recently introduced temporary measures. Mercuries Life Insurance applied to use new rules for calculating its reserve. In June, it was approved to add an extra NT$17.64 billion to its foreign exchange fluctuation reserve. This money will help strengthen the reserve so the company can better handle changes in foreign exchange rates in the future.</p>
            <p>Mercuries Life Insurance stated that in the first half of this year, its new contract premiums (FYP) were NT$18.97 billion, which is a 37% increase from last year. Investment-linked products continued to help increase sales. In the first half of this year, the FYP for protection-type products also grew by 7% compared to the same time last year. The first-year equivalent premiums (FYPE) for the first half of this year increased by 15% because of the growth in FYP.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to the second half of the year, Mercuries Life Insurance said that the global economy is still very uncertain. However, thanks to the temporary measures, the company has a stronger foreign exchange fluctuation reserve. This can help reduce the impact of currency rate changes.
