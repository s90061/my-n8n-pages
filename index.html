            <h1>US Defense Chief Gathers Generals, Trump Expected to Speak</h1>
            <p>A US official said today that President Trump is expected to go to a meeting of US military generals on September 30th. This meeting will be in Quantico, Virginia. People who know about it said Trump will speak at this special meeting for important military leaders.</p>
            <p>This meeting is unusual because it brings together many top US military leaders. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suddenly told hundreds of generals with one star or more, who are in charge of military groups around the world, to come to the Marine Corps base in Quantico.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post first reported that Trump would be at the meeting. They saw documents about the plans. The White House did not say anything about it right away.</p>
            <p>On September 27th, US officials told Reuters that Hegseth will talk about how all military members must keep a "warrior spirit." He might also talk about other topics during the meeting, which will last about one hour.</p>
            <p>US soldiers are in many countries around the world, such as South Korea, Japan, and places in the Middle East. Generals or admirals with two, three, or four stars lead these soldiers.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press said that some people are worried. They think this meeting of military leaders, who should not be involved in politics, might seem political because Trump will be there.</p>
            <p>This Republican president also recently used the US military in some American cities. He said it was needed to stop crime when leaders from the Democratic party could not keep order.</p>
            <p>Right now, the US military has about 800 generals. They are in more than ten countries and different time zones around the world. Many of them lead thousands of US soldiers.</p>

            <h1>US and Mexico Work Together to Stop Gun Smuggling, Improve Investigations and Technology</h1>
            <p>On September 27th, the US Department of State said that the United States and Mexico have started a new joint program. Its goal is to stop illegal guns from coming into the areas near the US-Mexico border.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Washington made this announcement one day after the first meeting of the US-Mexico Security Implementation Group.</p>
            <p>US Secretary of State Mark Rubio started this group earlier this month when he visited Mexico. He hopes both countries will work more closely to stop people from illegally moving drugs and weapons.</p>
            <p>The US Department of State explained that the new plan includes Mexico using US tools to find guns in all 32 of its states. These tools include the eTrace system and technology that looks at bullet images. Both countries will also work more together on investigations and share more information.</p>
            <p>This plan also says that both countries will start bigger joint investigations. They will make legal actions better and increase US inspections to stop weapons from being smuggled into Mexico. This will help prevent these weapons from making criminal groups more violent.</p>
            <p>Ronald Johnson, the US Ambassador to Mexico, said on social media: "This is the first time the US and Mexico will do joint checks, share information right away, and do more investigations at the same time. We hope to stop weapons from helping organized crime and hurting both our countries. This plan is a historic effort to keep both nations safe."</p>

            <h1>Taichung Real Estate Agent Accused of NT$1 Billion Fraud, Fled, Arrested Upon Return, Prosecutors Ask for Detention</h1>
            <p>In Taichung City, a man named Yeh, who owned a real estate company in Xitun District, is accused of fraud and illegally taking money. Over five years, people lost as much as NT$1 billion. Mr. Yeh left Taiwan on September 20th. Prosecutors issued a warrant for his arrest. This morning, Mr. Yeh was caught when he came back to Taiwan. Prosecutors then asked the court to keep him in jail and not let him talk to anyone.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office shared information today. Mr. Yeh, who is 42, owned a real estate company in Xitun District. From September 2020 to September this year, he was involved in fraud and illegally taking money. People lost up to NT$1 billion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yeh left Taiwan on September 20th. The Taichung District Prosecutors Office created a special team. They talked to the victims and other people who saw what happened. They also gathered evidence like receipts for cash payments, records of bank transfers, and screenshots of messages. On September 26th, Mr. Yeh's passport was canceled, and an order for his arrest was made. On the morning of September 28th, Mr. Yeh flew back to Taiwan from Thailand. The police caught him at Taoyuan International Airport and took him to the prosecutors.</p>
            <p>After asking him questions, prosecutors believe that Mr. Yeh committed fraud and illegally ran a banking business. These crimes are very serious, and the shortest jail sentence for them is 5 years or more. He also ran away before and might destroy evidence or talk to other suspects and witnesses to change their stories. So, in the evening, prosecutors asked the Taichung District Court to keep him in jail and not let him talk to anyone.</p>
