            <h1>Trump Again Criticizes Putin, Says He Is Disappointed; UK Prime Minister Starmer Calls for More Pressure on Russia</h1>
            <p>There has been little real progress in stopping the war between Russia and Ukraine. Today, US President Donald Trump said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has disappointed him. Trump stated, "He is killing many people, and he is losing more people than he is killing." He added that if oil prices fall, Putin will have no choice but to stop the war. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also stressed that more pressure must be put on Russia.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump went to the UK for a state visit. Today, he met with Keir Starmer at Chequers, the British Prime Minister's country home, which is about 1.5 hours' drive from London. They also held a joint press conference. Earlier, they signed a technology partnership agreement to make their countries' cooperation stronger in areas like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and nuclear energy.</p>
            <p>When asked how to help stop the war in Ukraine, Trump said that Putin has disappointed him. "He is killing many people, and he is losing more people than he is killing... Russian soldiers are dying more than Ukrainian soldiers," Trump stated.</p>
            <p>Starmer also pointed out that Putin recently showed his true intentions by starting the biggest attacks on Ukraine since the war began, causing more innocent deaths. He also noted that Russian drones entered the airspace of NATO countries. "These actions are not what someone who wants peace would do," Starmer said.</p>
            <p>He emphasized that Russia must face more pressure. To support Ukraine, the UK and France are working together and are ready to lead and take necessary actions.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump previously said that if all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil, he will place "major sanctions" on Russia. Today, he also said that if oil prices drop, Putin will have no choice but "to get out of that war." He hopes for good news soon.</p>
            <p>Starmer admitted that this is a challenge for Europe because some European countries depend too much on energy from Russia. "But we really need to work harder with our European partners," he said.</p>
            <p>Foreign reports previously stated that since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the European Union, which has 27 countries, has stopped most imports of Russian oil. Currently, only Hungary and Slovakia are still buying Russian oil. Both countries maintain friendly relations with Russia and Trump.</p>

            <p>Reuters reported that Trump and British Prime Minister Starmer earlier signed the Technology Prosperity Deal. This agreement aims for the US and UK to work together to develop artificial intelligence models in medicine, expand quantum computing abilities, and develop nuclear energy for civilian use.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that at the press conference, Trump described the Technology Prosperity Deal as "unique." He also said that this agreement will make sure that the US and UK "lead the next technology revolution together."</p>
            <p>Trump claimed that his state visit to the UK led to many business deals worth up to 350 billion US dollars in various areas.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that the United States and the United Kingdom are also working together on quantum computing and nuclear energy.</p>
            <p>Starmer noted that this investment "will make us richer and freer." He also showed that the US and UK are determined to win this competition together.</p>
            <p>He also stated, "We are bringing businesses to join us."</p>

            <h1>Three Typhoons Form in One Day; Typhoon Kasumiga May Become a Moderate Typhoon, Closest to Taiwan on September 23-24</h1>
            <p>After Typhoon Mitag formed this afternoon, the 21st and 22nd tropical depressions became Typhoon Kasumiga and Typhoon Kujira this evening. The Central Weather Administration stated that Typhoon Kasumiga might approach Taiwan as a moderate typhoon. A sea warning could be issued as early as the afternoon of September 21.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration stated that Typhoon Mitag, the 17th typhoon, formed this afternoon. It is expected to move northwest towards Guangdong, China. It is not likely to directly affect Taiwan, but its outer bands will indirectly affect Taiwan's weather.</p>
            <p>This evening, the Weather Administration announced that two more typhoons had formed. The 21st tropical depression, which was west of Guam, grew into Typhoon Kasumiga, the 18th typhoon of the year. The 22nd tropical depression, northwest of Wake Island, also became a light typhoon, named Typhoon Kujira, the 19th typhoon of the year. With these two, a total of three typhoons formed in one day.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration said that Typhoon Kasumiga is expected to move northwest. It will get close to the northeast sea of the Philippines starting on September 21. A sea typhoon warning might be issued as early as the afternoon of September 21.</p>
            <p>Kasumiga will start to approach Taiwan on September 22, and its outer bands will cause effects. The Weather Administration said that Kasumiga will be closest to Taiwan from September 23 to the morning of September 24. It might also become a moderate typhoon when it is close.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration pointed out that due to Typhoon Kasumiga and its outer bands, from September 23 to the morning of September 24, areas in the east, southeast, and the Hengchun Peninsula will likely have showers or thunderstorms. The rain will last longer, and there is a chance of local heavy rain or extreme heavy rain. Also, northern, northeastern, and southern areas, and the central mountain areas will have local short showers or thunderstorms. There is also a chance of local heavy rain in the northeast, Pingtung area, and other mountain areas.</p>
            <p>Regarding Typhoon Kujira, the Weather Administration said that it is expected to move northwest towards Japan in the future and will not directly affect Taiwan.</p>
