            <h1>British Central Bank Lowers Interest Rate to 4%; Decision-Makers Disagree</h1>
            <p>Today, the Bank of England's committee that decides on money matters voted to lower the main interest rate. Five members voted to lower the rate by 0.25% to 4%. However, four members did not agree. They were worried that prices were rising too much and wanted to keep the interest rate the same.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the committee could not agree in their first vote. So, they had to vote a second time. This was the first time they ever needed a second vote.</p>
            <p>The committee found it hard to agree on how to deal with prices going up and more people losing their jobs. The Bank thinks that rising prices might soon be twice as high as their target of 2%.</p>
            <p>In the first vote, four members wanted to lower the rate by 0.25%, and four members wanted to keep it the same. One special member, Alan Taylor, wanted to lower the rate by 0.5%.</p>
            <p>In the second vote, Andrew Bailey, the head of the Bank, and four other members voted 5 to 4. They decided to lower the main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%.</p>
            <p>The members who wanted to keep the rate at 4.25% included Clare Lombardelli, a deputy head of the Bank who works on money policy. This was the first time she voted differently from most members. Huw Pill, the Bank's main economist, also wanted to keep the rate the same.</p>
            <p>The Bank of England also said again that they will be "slow and careful" about lowering borrowing costs more. But in their message about the future, they added a hint. This hint suggests that they might stop lowering interest rates soon.</p>
            <p>The Bank of England said that as they lower the main interest rate, their money policy becomes less strict. This means the Bank is no longer directly saying that their policy is still strict. The Bank also said again that they do not have a fixed plan for future borrowing costs.</p>

            <h1>80 Years Since World War II Ended: Chen Yi-shen Says US Saw Taiwan as 'Status Undecided' After Korean War</h1>
            <p>This year marks 80 years since World War II finished. Today, a scholar named Li Jun-shan gave a speech. He said that old records show the United States once thought Taiwan was an "ownerless island." Chiang Kai-shek decided to "wait and see" how to deal with who owned Taiwan. This has made the situation around Taiwan unclear until now. Chen Yi-shen, who leads the Academia Historica, explained that after the Korean War, the US started to say that "Taiwan's status is undecided." He said this was almost a rule for the US, not just a policy.</p>
            <p>Because it is 80 years since World War II ended, the Academia Historica and Taiwan Historica planned six talks. Chen Yi-shen said that these talks, two in Taipei and four in Nantou, want to show what new research has found about the history of the Republic of China and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The first talk was in the afternoon. Professor Li Jun-shan from National Chung Hsing University gave the speech. He talked about "The Nationalist Government's Land Claims During World War II and Changes After the War." Li Jun-shan said that Taiwan has gone through many big changes since the 1800s. But it has always been very lucky and avoided many wars. Taiwan has become a "clean land." He said, "God bless Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Li Jun-shan said that in 1944, the US Navy planned to land in Taiwan. But General MacArthur, who was in charge of US forces in the Pacific, really wanted to take back the Philippines first. His next target was Okinawa. Because of this, Taiwan did not have heavy fighting. If it had, the result would be hard to imagine.</p>
            <p>He believes that Taiwan's status was very complicated after the war. The US at that time thought Taiwan was an "ownerless island," meaning no one truly owned it. The US Seventh Fleet went into the Taiwan Strait. On the surface, it looked like they were helping the Republic of China. But in truth, they were doing it to protect themselves. Their goal was to make sure the US had a safe way out during the Korean War. He said the Seventh Fleet "put a temporary hold" on Taiwan. This means the US held the island, and its future was not decided yet.</p>
            <p>Li Jun-shan said that in 1949, the Truman government wrote a report that strongly criticized Chiang Kai-shek. They said he was corrupt and not able to lead. This showed that the US wanted to "protect Taiwan but not Chiang." Later, Chiang Kai-shek heard that the US wanted to make the Taiwan Strait neutral. He then wrote clearly in his diary that he would never publicly agree to the Taiwan Strait being neutral. He also refused to lose control of Taiwan. This way of "waiting and seeing" has made Taiwan's status undecided until today.</p>
            <p>Li Jun-shan said that when the US and Taiwan signed a defense treaty together, they mentioned Taiwan's undecided status. But from the 1960s, US officials slowly stopped talking about this idea.</p>
            <p>He believes that people in the US have many different ideas about Taiwan. They have not yet agreed on one clear view, so it is hard to say it is an official policy. However, the US State Department and other related groups mostly handle Taiwan issues based on "three official statements." Official US papers do not often mention "Taiwan's status is undecided" anymore. Also, the US foreign policy shows different rules depending on different interests and viewpoints, making their position on Taiwan's status unclear.</p>
            <p>Regarding the different ways people talk about the end of World War II, Li Jun-shan, from the view of diplomatic history, said that for the 80th anniversary of WWII, people mostly use their own words. Whether it is called a victory, a recovery, the end of the war, or even a re-occupation, everyone can use their own terms. In a society with many different ideas, everyone accepts each other's views.</p>
            <p>After the talk, Chen Yi-shen spoke with CNA reporters. He said that the Cairo Declaration was first made after Chiang Kai-shek asked US President Roosevelt for support. Then, they were able to convince the British. This led to the version where Taiwan and Penghu were returned. But in 1949, General MacArthur said that the Cairo Declaration was not the final word. In 1950, President Truman then said that Taiwan's status was undecided. This happened because China became communist and because of the Korean War.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-shen said that Li Jun-shan focused on how strong countries are connected and how weaker countries depend on others in their foreign policy. This is often called "big power politics." But weaker countries can also have their own foreign policy. Taiwan went through two big problems in the Taiwan Strait in the 1950s and a third one in the 1990s. Taiwan got through these safely because the US and the Republic of China (Taiwan) worked closely together.</p>
            <p>About Li Jun-shan saying Taiwan was an ownerless island, Chen Yi-shen said that he understood Li to mean that the Seventh Fleet could come and go as it liked, and it did not depend on whether the Republic of China owned Taiwan and Penghu. This is what the US meant when they said "Taiwan's status is undecided" after the Korean War. It was almost a rule for the US, not just a policy.</p>

            <h1>Trump Talks About 100% Semiconductor Tariffs; Kuo Chih-hui Invites TSMC and Other Big Companies to a Meeting</h1>
            <p>US President Trump has announced that all semiconductors imported into the United States will have a 100% tax, called a tariff. However, if companies build or are already building factories in the US, they will not have to pay this tariff. Today, Kuo Chih-hui, the Minister of Economic Affairs, met with important companies like TSMC, UMC, Powerchip, Nanya Tech, ASE, GlobalWafers, and Hon Hai. The companies at the meeting suggested that the US should avoid putting different tariffs on different companies, which could be unfair to the industry.</p>
            <p>Trump said that there would be a 100% tariff on all chips and semiconductors sent to the US. But if a company promised to build or was already building a factory in the US, like many companies are doing, then "there would be no tariff." If a company did not keep its promise to build a factory in the US for some reason, the US would collect the tariffs later, for past imports.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau shared a press release tonight. It said that Kuo Chih-hui invited Taiwan's semiconductor industry groups (SEMI) and major semiconductor companies to a meeting today. They talked and exchanged ideas about the US policy changes and how to respond to them.</p>
            <p>At the meeting, companies generally said that the US plans to add tariffs to semiconductors and chips. But the details about what will be taxed, how it will be taxed, who will not have to pay, and how it will all work are not yet clear. They need more time to see and understand the rules. Based on how the US added tariffs on steel, aluminum, or cars (under Section 232 tariffs), the companies suggested that the government should actively talk with the US. They should try to get good conditions for the industry and make sure the US does not add tariffs differently, which could be unfair to some companies.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that they will give the companies' suggestions from today to the Taiwan-US trade working group. This group will continue to talk with the US. The ministry will also stay in close contact with the companies. They will prepare in different ways for any problems that might come up in the future.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out that Taiwan's semiconductor industry has had a strong partnership with US customers for a long time. Taiwan provides valuable chip products that help the US to be competitive and create new things in the global technology industry.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that Taiwan and the US always work well together in semiconductors and high technology. They work closely on research, making products, and using them. They help each other and benefit from each other. Taiwan's industry plays a very important role in making sure the global supply chain is strong. It will continue to help in the future.</p>
