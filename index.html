            <h1>Silicon Valley Welcomes Taiwan-U.S. Tech Week, North America Taiwan Tech Summit is the Main Event</h1>
            <p>Taiwan-U.S. Tech Week will start in Silicon Valley in mid-September. The 4th North America Taiwan Technology Summit will begin on September 20th. This year, the event will continue to focus on AI and job searching. It will also have new topics. American scholars will talk about Sovereign AI. A musician from Silicon Valley will perform "Silicon Island," a piece by composer Huang Chung-chun.</p>
            <p>The 2025 North America Taiwan Technology Summit is organized by the TaiwanNext Foundation. It brings together many Taiwanese-American tech groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. It connects different fields and talented people.</p>
            <p>This year, there are two main forums. They are the AI Application Forum and the Sovereign AI Forum. The Data Science Meetup group organizes the first one. The Global Alliance for Taiwan's Technology Diplomacy (GATTD) organizes the second one. For the Sovereign AI Forum, scholars Kharis Templeman and Sergey Sanovich from the Hoover Institution will speak. They will discuss Taiwan's supply chain.</p>
            <p>Kharis Templeman helped write a report called "Silicon Triangle: The U.S., Taiwan, China, and Global Semiconductor Security." In the report, he suggested that the U.S. and Taiwan should work more closely on semiconductors. Sergey Sanovich is an expert in cybersecurity and preventing false information.</p>
            <p>Hans Wang, the Deputy Executive Director of the Global Alliance for Taiwan's Technology Diplomacy, said in a press conference that Sovereign AI is a new idea. It does not have a standard definition yet. American scholars will share new ideas from political and legal points of view.</p>
            <p>The AI Application Forum will focus on how generative AI continues to change industries, how work is done, and human creativity.</p>
            <p>Startup Island TAIWAN Silicon Valley Hub, led by the National Development Council, has planned a Taiwan startup show. It gives AI startup teams a chance to share their newest technologies and products. It also helps them connect with venture capitalists and companies in Silicon Valley.</p>
            <p>AI is changing jobs. The summit also provides a platform where leaders from companies like Google, Apple, and Meta will share their ideas about changing jobs and looking for jobs. This helps Taiwanese and American tech talents find opportunities in the AI era. Missy Chen, a senior project manager and one of the co-organizers, hopes this event will help university and graduate students prepare for their future.</p>
            <p>Fermi Wang, the CEO of Ambarella, an American chip company, will give the main speech.</p>
            <p>The evening event will combine AI and music. Grammy Award winner Ivan Linn will give a speech. Musicians from different countries in Silicon Valley will perform together for the first time. They will play "Silicon Island," a piece for seven instruments by Taiwanese-American composer Huang Chung-chun.</p>
            <p>Katie Hsieh, the chair of the TaiwanNext Foundation, said that the 2025 summit will let technology extend into the night. It will show Taiwan's creative influence to the world in a setting that is close to the industry in Silicon Valley.</p>

            <h1>Sinner Wins Against Shapovalov at U.S. Open, Moves to Round of 16 in Men's Singles</h1>
            <p>Jannik Sinner, who won the U.S. Open men's singles last year, beat Denis Shapovalov today. Sinner lost the first set but then won three sets in a row. He has now moved to the Round of 16 in the U.S. Open men's singles.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Jannik Sinner, who is ranked number one in the world, came back strongly after losing the first set. He won against Denis Shapovalov from Canada with scores of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. Sinner is trying to be the first player since Roger Federer in 2008 to win the U.S. Open men's singles two times in a row.</p>
            <p>Sinner said, "Today was a very, very tough match. I have known Denis (Shapovalov) for a long time. I knew I had to play at a very high level."</p>
            <p>He last played against Shapovalov at the Australian Open in 2021 and lost that match.</p>
            <p>Sinner is now waiting for the result of the night match between Tommy Paul from the U.S., who is the 14th seed, and Alexander Bublik from Kazakhstan, who is the 23rd seed. Sinner will play against the winner.</p>
            <p>This season, Sinner has reached the finals of three Grand Slams. He won the Australian Open and Wimbledon. However, he lost to Carlos Alcaraz from Spain in the French Open final.</p>
            <p>Federer is the most recent player to win the U.S. Open men's singles two times in a row. He won five times in a row from 2004 to 2008.</p>

            <h1>Naomi Osaka Beats Kasatkina, Moves to U.S. Open Round of 16 to Play Gauff</h1>
            <p>Naomi Osaka, a former U.S. Open women's singles champion, won a tough three-set match against Daria Kasatkina from Australia today. She has reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open for the first time in five years. Next, she will play against the rising American star, Coco Gauff.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, the last time Naomi Osaka reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open was in 2020. That year, she went on to win the women's singles title. Today, she took advantage of Kasatkina, the 15th seed, having trouble with her serves. Osaka won the match with scores of 6-0, 4-6, 6-3.</p>
            <p>This victory is her best performance in a Grand Slam singles tournament since she had a baby in 2023 and returned to playing last year.</p>
            <p>She said, "This journey has been very long, but I am happy to be here now." This will be the first time Osaka has reached the second week of a Grand Slam since winning the Australian Open in 2021.</p>
            <p>Naomi Osaka said she is excited to play against Coco Gauff, who won the U.S. Open women's singles in 2023. Osaka sees Gauff as her "little sister."</p>
            <p>When talking about her upcoming match with Gauff, Osaka joked to the audience, "Can anyone come to watch this match and cheer for me? Because it's a bit hard to play against an American here."</p>
            <p>Coco Gauff, the 3rd seed, played well today after struggling in earlier rounds. She easily beat Magdalena Frech from Poland in two straight sets. Gauff has now moved to the Round of 16 in the U.S. Open women's singles.</p>
            <p>On August 28th, Gauff had a difficult match against Donna Vekic from Croatia and even cried on the court. But today, she showed her most steady performance at the U.S. Open. She only took 1 hour and 13 minutes to win 6-3, 6-1 against Frech, who was the 28th seed.</p>
