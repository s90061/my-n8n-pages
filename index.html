            <h1>DPP Criticizes Lack of Democratic Rule of Law; Ling Tao Says Public Distrusts Justice</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Ling Tao, who is a deputy leader at the KMT party's think tank, said that after former People's Party chairman Ko Wen-je was released on bail, the Lai government should also release KMT staff. This would make Taiwan's justice system fair again. Today, Ms. Dai Wei-shan, a spokesperson for the DPP party, said that Ling Tao's defense was wrong. She stated he made "three mistakes" because he lacked basic logic and understanding of democratic laws.</p>
            <p>In a press release, Ling Tao pointed out that a poll from the KMT in May showed that 48% of people felt that prosecutors were unfair when dealing with KMT cases. Only 36% thought the investigations were fair. This shows that the public's distrust in the justice system is real. He also said that President Lai is allowing this unfairness to continue.</p>
            <p>Ling Tao explained that the justice system should fairly investigate any "errors, fake information, copying, or false claims" related to signature collection. However, people feel that only KMT cases are investigated, not DPP cases. He said that cases about personal data, for example, are often handled with strong actions like big searches and arrests. These actions seem too much and are used to remove KMT members from power. He believes that people in Taiwan do not agree with this. He also said that these methods are very different from how similar cases were handled before, which suggests there is a political reason.</p>
            <p>Today, Ms. Dai Wei-shan said in a press release that Ling Tao's first mistake is not understanding the law. She explained that judges decide if a suspect stays in prison or is released. This is not a decision for the government. But Ling Tao, she said, thinks that political parties can tell the justice system what to do, which is wrong and misleads people.</p>
            <p>She also said his second mistake is not using logic. In the case where the KMT party made fake signatures, there is strong proof of more than 20,000 fake signatures. Most of the party staff involved have said they are guilty. However, the person who told them to do this has not appeared, and the KMT central office and its chairman, Eric Chu, has not said sorry.</p>
            <p>Finally, Ms. Dai Wei-shan stated that Ling Tao's third mistake is being blind to facts. She pointed out that in cases about problems with green energy, most of the people who were charged or found guilty were KMT members. The police and prosecutors are still looking into these cases. But Ling Tao, she said, pretends not to see his own party's problems and does not talk about them. She believes that the justice system should follow laws and facts, and the KMT should not keep using different rules for different situations.</p>

            <h1>Zhubei, Hsinchu County: Air Smell Problem, Monitoring Starts on September 9th</h1>
            <p>Zhubei City in Hsinchu County has had several reports of strange smells in the air. Today, KMT lawmaker Hsu Hsin-ying held a meeting with the Ministry of Environment and others to discuss long-term solutions. This afternoon, they visited Shuizun Park in Zhubei City to check where a monitoring vehicle could be placed. They plan to start monitoring the air tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Xiao Hong-jie, the head of the Hsinchu County Government Environmental Protection Bureau, told a CNA reporter that on August 26th and September 4th, there were bad smells in the air in Zhubei City. The Environmental Protection Bureau sent people to check and used small devices to measure air pollution. They also started looking at air quality data. However, they did not find a big increase in PM2.5 or VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds).</p>
            <p>Hsu Hsin-ying said in a message that the Ministry of Environment promised to give special testing methods and equipment at the morning meeting in the Legislative Yuan. They also went to Zhubei to check places for the monitoring vehicle. The Ministry of Environment will also provide special steel containers to collect air samples and arrange for air quality monitoring vehicles. These will use professional methods to find out what substances are causing the bad smell.</p>
            <p>Jiang Yu-de, the Vice President of the National Environmental Research Institute, said in a message that the smell is like burning plastic. He thinks the smell might come from Volatile Organic Compounds. After this, they plan to send an air quality monitoring vehicle and provide stainless steel containers for collecting samples. These samples will then be sent to the National Environmental Research Institute's lab for testing.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hsinchu County Government Environmental Protection Bureau, the Zhubei City Office, Hsu Hsin-ying's office, and other groups checked the spot for the air quality monitoring vehicle. They plan to put one vehicle there, and it will start working in Shuizun Park tomorrow for one week.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Young People Sleep, Not Exercise, in 24-Hour Gyms to Save Money for Naps and Overnight Stays</h1>
            <p>Young people in China who feel stressed from work or cannot find jobs often used to stay overnight at internet cafes or bathhouses. Now, they have found that 24-hour gyms are a new popular place to sleep. They just need to buy a monthly pass for about 200 Chinese Yuan (around 860 New Taiwan Dollars). Also, some working people now use gyms as a place to sleep during their lunch break.</p>
            <p>A report from "Sanlian Life Lab" (part of Sanlian Life Weekly) says that some gyms in China are now like hotels for young people. Yoga mats become beds, and the sound of others running helps them sleep. There are also showers available. The report describes that some young people find a more peaceful sleep in 24-hour gyms than at home. They even have a new way of traveling called "sleeping around the country."</p>
            <p>The report mentions that some young Chinese people think internet cafes are cheaper, but the noise from games makes it hard to sleep. Bathhouses seem comfortable, but if they cannot get a private room, they have to sleep on bunk beds and need to take off their clothes. Gyms, however, do not require them to fight for a bed. They can "sleep under the sky with the ground as their bed." Some people say that when others are busy doing things, they can secretly nap, and it feels better than sleeping at home.</p>
            <p>The report says that the first people to discover gyms as a "holy place for sleeping" were office workers who found time to exercise during lunch. But then, yoga and meditation classes turned into group nap times. Fewer people did the exercises, and more people slept on the floor to the meditation music. As long as they did not snore, sleeping in the gym was seen as "high-level meditation." After that, 24-hour gyms in Chinese cities became full of young people who did not want to exercise but only wanted to sleep.</p>
            <p>Some people said that if they buy a gym's monthly pass, they will always have a place to stay even if they go to other cities. Since gyms have many branches across the country, it means they can "sleep around the country."</p>
            <p>According to the report, a woman named He Liuliu, who works at a startup company in Beijing, recently bought a monthly pass for a chain gym above her office. It costs 200 yuan a month, and she only uses it for sleeping, not exercising. She clearly stated that she bought the pass to "get a good nap" during her lunch break, which is better than renting a room by the hour. In winter, with floor heating and a blanket, it is even better for sleeping. After 10 PM, when everyone leaves, the whole gym becomes a luxurious room where she can sleep or exercise as she wishes.</p>
            <p>Another office worker from Beijing, born between 1990 and 1999, named Chachazi, thought about staying overnight at a 24-hour chain gym when he first came to Beijing. He thought he could save money on accommodation by using his monthly pass from his hometown. But he later found out that a manager would check the gym at night, and there was a clear rule against staying overnight. So, he could only do some cardio exercises at night and then take a short nap on a yoga mat. It could be used like a hourly room, but not like a big hotel.</p>
            <p>Another person, Bobo, a 35-year-old employee of a state-owned company in Beijing, first bought a gym membership at a five-star hotel across from his office to exercise well. But after a month, he could not keep going. So, he only used the gym as a sauna. Recently, he started using the resting area as a big bedroom to take naps. He said that going to the sauna requires showering and changing clothes, but in the gym's resting area, he can just lie down and sleep. The lights are also softer, and an hour for a nap is just right.</p>
