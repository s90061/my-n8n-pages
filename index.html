**Taitung and Guam Work Together to Build Ancient Austronesian Boat**

Taiwan's Taitung region and Guam are working together to build a special boat called a "cross-island Austronesian boat." This project involves three different groups: the Chamorro people from Guam, and the Tao and Amis indigenous groups from Taiwan. The boat will combine their traditional boat-building skills. The goal is to finish the boat in three months and launch it in October. This project is important for keeping their cultures alive and connecting their shared history as Austronesian people. The builders hope to sail this traditional boat from Guam to Taiwan in the future.
