The Ministry of Education in Taiwan has changed its list of approved universities and colleges in mainland China. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from this list. Now, there are 154 universities and 191 colleges still recognized.

Taiwan's Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said earlier this year that schools linked to China's United Front Work Department are not focused on academics, but on special political goals. He stated that it is important to stop working with them and that Taiwan will no longer accept degrees from these schools.

The Ministry of Education explained that Guangzhou Jinan University has been controlled by China's United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students can study in a proper academic environment without political influence, the university was taken off the list.

The Ministry also said that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair and respectful. They advised schools in Taiwan to be careful about activities invited by China, especially if these activities have political aims or content. Schools should also avoid getting free trips or helping with China's political messages. If schools are unsure about an event, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for help. Taiwan still hopes for exchanges where young students from both sides can learn together, but they should be aware of possible risks and political motives.
