            <h1>You Can Now Scrap License Plates for Large Vehicles and Small Electric Two-Wheelers Online</h1>
            <p>To make it easier for people to scrap or cancel vehicle license plates, the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) announced today that the online service for this has been expanded. From now on, owners of large private vehicles, commercial vehicles, and small electric two-wheelers can use the "Motor Vehicle Services Network" to apply online.</p>
            <p>Before this, the DGH launched online services like "License Plate Scrapping and Cancellation Online Application Service" and "One-Stop Vehicle Recycling Service." Owners of motorcycles and small private cars could use these services anytime and anywhere to scrap or cancel their plates. They were not limited by place or time. Since late 2020, about 600,000 applications have been completed.</p>
            <p>The DGH said in a press release that starting today, more types of vehicles and owners can use the service. This includes owners of large private vehicles and small electric two-wheelers. It also includes transport businesses like tour bus companies, car rental companies, small truck rental companies, and cargo transport companies. These companies need to log in as members on the Motor Vehicle Services Network.</p>
            <p>The DGH stated that you only need to apply online to scrap or cancel your plate. You must also pay any fuel taxes and traffic fines. Then, you need to mail the license plate back to the Motor Vehicle Office within 10 days. After that, the process is complete. The system will also send a scrapping certificate for the owner to keep.</p>
            <p>The DGH reminds people that after applying online, you must send the license plate back to the Motor Vehicle Office within 10 days. If you do not send it back on time, your application will be canceled. You will then need to apply online and send the plate again to finish the process.</p>
            <p>For vehicles that have completed the scrapping or cancellation process, the DGH notes that they cannot be driven or parked on roads. If a vehicle is driven illegally, the owner will be fined between NT$3,600 and NT$10,800, according to Article 12 of the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act. The vehicle will also be taken away immediately.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the DGH pointed out that owners of large private vehicles and various transport companies (tour bus companies, car rental companies, small truck rental companies, and cargo transport companies) who need both vehicle body recycling and license plate scrapping can apply through the Ministry of Environment's "One-Stop Vehicle Recycling Service" (https://recyclecar.moenv.gov.tw/). This allows them to complete both tasks at once.</p>

            <h1>Gaza Situation Worsens; Norway's Main Wealth Fund Will Sell Investments in Israel</h1>
            <p>Norway's main wealth fund said today that it will sell its investments in 11 Israeli companies. This news comes after media reports that the fund was still investing in an Israeli company that makes parts for fighter jets, even during the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the fund, said this decision was made "due to special circumstances."</p>
            <p>Tangen said in a statement, "The situation in Gaza is a serious human crisis. We invest in companies that work in countries at war, and recently, the situation in the West Bank and Gaza has become worse."</p>
            <p>He added that this action will reduce the number of Israeli companies that the fund's Council of Ethics needs to watch.</p>
            <p>Norway's main wealth fund is also called the "Oil Fund." It gets its money from the country's large profits from selling energy. It is the biggest wealth fund in the world, worth about 1.9 trillion US dollars (around 57 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). It invests in over 8,600 companies worldwide.</p>
            <p>Last week, the Norwegian newspaper "Aftenposten" reported that Norway's main wealth fund invested in Israeli Bet Shemesh Engines Holdings. This company produces engine parts for Israeli fighter jets.</p>
            <p>Tangen later confirmed this report. He also said that the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund even increased its shares in the company after Israel started its attacks on Gaza.</p>
            <p>After this information was revealed, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store asked Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who used to be the NATO Secretary General, to review the situation.</p>
            <p>Norges Bank Investment Management stated that as of the first half of this year, the fund had invested in 61 Israeli companies. Among these, 11 were not part of their "equity benchmark index." The Norwegian equity benchmark index is set by the Ministry of Finance to check how well the sovereign wealth fund is doing.</p>
            <p>Norges Bank Investment Management also said that last week, they decided to "sell all investments in Israeli companies not included in the equity benchmark index as soon as possible."</p>
