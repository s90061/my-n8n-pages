            <h1>Apple Updates iOS 26 and Other Software, Adds AI Live Translation and Visual Intelligence</h1>
            <p>Apple Inc. today updated its software platforms, including iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. These updates bring a new design called Liquid Glass and new features for Apple Intelligence, which is a personal smart system. These new features include live translation, visual intelligence for screen content, and smart actions within Shortcuts.</p>
            <p>Apple explained on its official website that the new Liquid Glass software design now works across all its software platforms. It keeps the unique parts of each platform but also makes the experience more consistent. Liquid Glass is a new see-through material that reflects and bends light from its surroundings. It also changes dynamically to show content more clearly.</p>
            <p>Apple Intelligence helps users talk easily across different languages. It does this with live translation in Messages, FaceTime, Phone calls, and AirPods. The updated Visual Intelligence lets users take screenshots of what they see on their screen. They can then ask questions about it to chatbots like ChatGPT or search for similar pictures using Google and other supported apps.</p>
            <p>Apple Intelligence has other new features too. Users can now combine different emojis to create new Genmoji. They can also use ChatGPT in "Image Playground" to unlock new image styles. Apple Intelligence also powers a "Workout Buddy" feature, which gives personalized voice encouragement during exercise.</p>
            <p>iOS 26 offers more ways to customize the "Lock Screen." This includes an adaptive time display and 3D space scenes. It also improves apps like Camera, Photos, Safari, and Phone. "Call Screening" can block calls from unknown numbers. "Hold Assist" can hold your place in line when you are waiting to speak to a customer service person.</p>
            <p>iOS 26 also adds "Lyric Translation and Pronunciation" to Apple Music. In Apple Maps, it adds "Visited Locations." In Apple Wallet, it provides order tracking. Updates to AirPods allow creators to record high-quality sound and control the Camera app remotely.</p>
            <p>iPadOS 26 has a new menu bar. Users can swipe down from the top of the screen or move the mouse cursor to the top to see commands available in an app. The Files app now has new ways to manage files and organize folders. Also, folders can now be placed on the Dock, so users can always access downloaded files or documents.</p>
            <p>macOS Tahoe greatly improves productivity on Mac computers. It offers more ways to personalize a Mac, including an updated "Control Center" and new colors for folders, app icons, and widgets. The menu bar is now completely transparent, making the display look wider. Spotlight has a big update, offering new ways to view files and apps, and better search functions. Shortcuts can directly use Apple Intelligence models to automate many complex tasks.</p>
            <p>watchOS 26 offers more ways to personalize. A new "Sleep Score" feature is now on Apple Watch to help users understand their sleep quality better. The new system has "Smart Stack" hints, which actively give useful suggestions right away. "Live Translation" in Messages can automatically translate text into the user's preferred language. A new one-handed wrist-flip gesture can be used to skip notifications, mute calls, stop alarms, and return to the watch face.</p>
            <p>tvOS 26 has an "Apple Music Sing" karaoke feature. It can turn an iPhone into a wireless microphone for Apple TV. Friends can also use their iPhones to add songs. FaceTime's "Contact Posters" make it easier for users to start calls in their living room.</p>
            <p>visionOS 26 provides widgets that fit smoothly into the user's environment. These widgets appear automatically every time the Apple Vision Pro spatial computing device is worn. The "Spatial Browsing" feature changes how articles are shown in the Safari browser, letting developers put 3D objects directly into web pages. visionOS 26 also supports playing 180-degree, 360-degree, and wide-angle sports camera content, including from certain Insta360, GoPro, and Canon cameras.</p>

            <h1>Investment Advisor: US Stocks Close Higher, Meta Conference Watched Closely; Taiwan Stocks Focus on AI Industry</h1>
            <p>On September 15th, the main US stock indexes all closed higher because people expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Nvidia's stock price went down by 0.04%, but TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) went up by 0.79%. An investment advisory firm said that Meta, the company that owns Facebook, will have its developer conference on the 17th. People expect it to focus on AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the metaverse. How related industries move will be important for the market. Also, everyone is watching for news about interest rate cuts from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve.</p>
            <p>Today, four listed stocks in Taiwan, including TSMC, KMC, Evergreen Health, and Ritek, will remove their dividends. This will affect Taiwan's Weighted Stock Index by 40.48 points at the start of trading. TSMC will pay a dividend of NT$5 per share. This means its market value will drop by about NT$129.7 billion, which is about 40.43 points of the Weighted Stock Index.</p>
            <p>Looking at US stock performance on September 15th, investors expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this week. The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq index both reached new record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up a little by 49.23 points, or 0.11%, closing at 45883.45 points. The S&P 500 index went up by 30.99 points, or 0.47%, closing at 6615.28 points. The Nasdaq index rose sharply by 207.65 points, or 0.94%, closing at 22348.75 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 58.09 points, or 0.97%, closing at 6059.83 points.</p>
            <p>For Taiwan stocks, the index dropped by 117.48 points on September 15th, closing at 25357.16 points. The total value of shares traded was NT$397.448 billion. The three main groups of institutional investors (dealers, investment trusts, and foreign investors) together sold NT$4.206 billion worth of shares. Among them, dealers bought NT$0.996 billion, investment trusts sold NT$7.748 billion, and foreign and mainland Chinese investors bought NT$2.546 billion.</p>
            <p>KGI Investment Advisory said that from a technical point of view, Taiwan stocks dropped in price and had less trading volume on September 15th. This shows that the market is unstable at a high level. However, the moving averages still show an upward trend. The trading volume has been lower than the 5-day average for two days in a row, and even lower than the 20-day average. They will watch if the market can stay above the 5-day moving average in the short term.</p>

            <h1>German "Rust Belt" Voters More Worried; Expert Says It Could Become a Stronghold for the AfD Party</h1>
            <p>The results for the election in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia state are mostly decided. The ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) got the most support and stopped the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has been growing in recent years. However, experts say that the AfD gained three times more votes in the Ruhr industrial area, known as Germany's "Rust Belt." This shows that voters are increasingly worried about immigration and a bad economy. Experts think the "Rust Belt" could become a strong support area for the AfD in the future.</p>
            <p>North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populated state, held local elections on September 14th. In more than 30 of the 53 cities and towns, the ruling CDU party led. The Green Party lost many votes, but it still did well in younger university cities and larger urban areas like MÃ¼nster, Cologne, and Bonn.</p>
            <p>Norbert Kersting, a political science professor at MÃ¼nster University, said in an online meeting with reporters today that this election is important for Berlin. This is because it is the biggest local election after the German federal government started its term 100 days ago.</p>
            <p>Before the election, people wondered if the AfD would get more local power. The results show that traditional parties like the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) lost some votes, but they still successfully stopped the AfD.</p>
            <p>Kersting explained that the AfD could not put forward candidates in many cities. It lacked enough people at the local level. Also, its policies have always been only about immigration. It did not talk about local issues like transport or housing that people cared about. This is why the AfD's performance in North Rhine-Westphalia was not as good as its national election results.</p>
            <p>However, in Ruhr area cities like Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen, and Hagen, the AfD's votes clearly increased. Experts believe this is an important sign.</p>
            <p>The Ruhr industrial area, which grew thanks to coal and steel industries, used to be a very important part of Germany. Workers traditionally supported the center-left SPD party. But as German industries changed and factories closed, some towns in the Ruhr area faced economic problems and lost people.</p>
            <p>In the local election on September 15th, the AfD got almost 30% of the votes in Gelsenkirchen. This is more than three times what they got before, and their support is now close to the SPD, which used to be the biggest party there.</p>
            <p>Ansgar Hudde, a sociologist from the University of Cologne, said that the SPD is still losing support from traditional working-class voters. Many loyal voters would rather not vote at all than vote for the SPD.</p>
            <p>Kersting believes that the AfD in the Ruhr area attracts not only working-class people but also a group of "fearful citizens" who have become more extreme because they are scared. They feel very unsure about changes in society, immigration, and economic problems. This turns into strong anger in their political choices.</p>
            <p>Even though the AfD does not have much experience in local government, it can grow steadily in the "Rust Belt" by making people's worries bigger. This creates a challenge for traditional parties. Kersting expects that this power will grow even more because local money is tight and the economy is slow, especially in areas in western Germany that were not traditionally their strongholds.</p>
            <p>Next March, local elections will start in Bavaria, southern Germany. In September next year, the state parliament election will be held in Saxony-Anhalt, central Germany. Recent surveys show that the AfD has reached 40% in Saxony-Anhalt, which is more than the ruling CDU party.</p>
            <p>Kersting said that the election results in North Rhine-Westphalia mean the ruling CDU and SPD parties in the central government "got through safely." This gives the federal government six months without big elections, so they can focus on their "autumn reform" plans. These plans include citizen benefits, pension adjustments, and changes to the healthcare system.</p>
            <p>Kersting warned that the main political parties must offer better solutions for immigration and social inequality. Only then can they stop the far-right party from getting stronger in areas like the "Rust Belt," where industries have declined.</p>
