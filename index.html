The newest "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, made a lot of money in its first weekend in North America. It earned 122 million US dollars, making it the top movie. An expert said this is amazing for a hero movie that has been around for 75 years and is now on its seventh film. The director was praised for making a strong movie using a good story and filmmaking, not just big stars. Other movies like "Jurassic World: Rebirth" and "F1: The Movie" were also popular.

**Higher Fines for Fake License Plates Delayed**

New, tougher fines for using fake or changed car license plates, which could be as high as NT$72,000, will not start tomorrow as planned. The change is delayed because it takes longer than expected to update and test the computer system used for traffic fines. Also, there's more work needed to get ready for moving and storing cars and for training police. This law was changed because more people are using fake plates, which causes safety and crime problems. The Ministry of Transportation said they will tell everyone when the new rules are ready to begin.

**Linghang Technology to Go Public in August, Expects Record Revenue**

Linghang Technology, a company that makes memory modules, plans to be listed on the stock market in early August. The company's total sales in the first half of this year were NT$3.163 billion, which is almost 30% more than last year. Because memory sales are strong, the company expects to earn even more money in the second half of the year. They believe their total revenue for the year could be over NT$6 billion, which would be a new record. Linghang Technology started in 1998 and later moved into the memory industry in 2007, focusing on gaming, system integration, and industrial control markets.
