            <h1>Parents to Pay Over NT$60,000 After Children Put Plant Juice in Classmate's Water</h1>
            <p>In a primary school in central Taiwan, three girls had problems with a boy in their class. Two years ago, they put golden pothos plant juice into the boy's water bottle. This made him feel sick, and he had to go to the hospital. The boy's parents sued the girls' parents for money. The Taichung District Court has now ordered the parents of the three girls to pay a total of NT$61,800.</p>
            <p>Court documents from the Taichung District Court in Taiwan explain the case. A boy at a primary school in central Taiwan was classmates with three girls. The three girls were unhappy with what the boy said and did. So, in April 2023, they put golden pothos juice drops into the boy's water bottle. He drank it by mistake and then had problems like throwing up, diarrhea, and a numb mouth.</p>
            <p>In May of the same year, the three girls tried to put the plant juice into the boy's water bottle again. But other classmates saw them and stopped them. A few days later, the boy saw what looked like golden pothos juice near one of the girls' desks. He told his teacher, and this is how the whole story became known.</p>
            <p>The boy's parents sued the parents of the three girls. They asked for NT$15,080 for medical costs and NT$1,000,000 for emotional distress. This was a total of NT$1,015,080.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Court looked at the case carefully. They thought about the people involved, their social standing, how much money they had, and how much harm was done. The court decided that the girls' parents should pay NT$11,800 for medical costs and NT$50,000 for emotional distress. So, a total of NT$61,800 was judged to be fair. People can still appeal this decision.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says White House Will Host UFC Fight on His 80th Birthday Next Year</h1>
            <p>Today, former U.S. President Trump said that the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event, which he had announced would happen at the White House, is now set for June 14 next year. This date will also be his 80th birthday.</p>
            <p>Trump shared this news during a speech at Naval Station Norfolk. He was speaking to celebrate the U.S. Navy's 250th anniversary, which is coming soon.</p>
            <p>In July, Trump had already said that a UFC event would be held at the White House in 2026. But at that time, he did not say the exact date.</p>
            <p>Trump and Dana White, the head of UFC, are very good friends. Their friendship started even before Trump became president. Trump sees fans of fighting sports as an important group of his political supporters.</p>
            <p>This week, Dana White spoke to the "Sports Business Journal." He said that after the event, UFC will spend 700,000 U.S. dollars to put new grass on the South Lawn of the White House.</p>
            <p>Since Trump became president, he has often attended UFC events. His most recent visit was to a fight in New Jersey in June. Trump's friendship with White goes back to the year 2000. At that time, Trump Taj Mahal Hotel in Atlantic City was one of the few places in the U.S. willing to host UFC fights.</p>
            <p>TKO Group Holdings, the company that owns UFC, has not yet answered Reuters' request for comments.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Companies Invest More in the US, Leading to More Flights for EVA Air, China Airlines, and Starlux</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese companies are investing a lot in the United States. This means more people and goods need to travel. So, Taiwanese airlines are adding more flights to the US. EVA Air already flies directly to Dallas. Now, China Airlines and Starlux Airlines will also start direct flights to Phoenix. They want to compete in the US air travel market. They see many business travelers and cargo, and they also want to get more transfer passengers who fly through North America.</p>
            <p>Data shows that in 2024, Taiwan became the 7th largest trading partner for the US. Also, the US is the main country where Taiwan invests money overseas. Taiwan's government says that in 2024, Taiwanese companies invested 14.126 billion US dollars in the US. This is an increase of 45%. So far, Taiwanese companies have invested more than 100 billion US dollars in the US. This has created over 400,000 jobs there.</p>
            <p>TSMC's investment in Arizona is the most talked about. It will bring many other companies that make parts for semiconductors to the US. Also, the "Stargate" project and big American companies like NVIDIA and Apple are investing more in Texas. This has made seven major electronics companies, including Foxconn, quickly plan to open businesses in Texas.</p>
            <p>Recently, Cheng Li-chun, the Vice Premier of Taiwan, suggested that Taiwan will use its successful experience of building science parks. Taiwan will offer good deals for investing, getting loans, and guaranteeing credit. This will help Taiwanese companies create industry areas in the US. High-tech companies from Taiwan, like those in semiconductors, semiconductor supply chains, and electronic manufacturing services (EMS) for AI servers, are expected to invest more in the US. People in Taiwan also want the US to quickly approve the "Taiwan-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement" (ADTA). This would make it even better for companies to invest.</p>
            <p>Because Taiwanese companies are investing more in the US, local airlines are responding to this need. They are actively adding more routes to the US and increasing the number of flights.</p>
            <p>EVA Air is the leading Taiwanese airline for North American flights. With the new direct flight to Dallas, it now flies directly to 9 major cities in North America. These cities are Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Houston, Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto, and Dallas.</p>
            <p>EVA Air said that by the end of the year, it will have 94 flights to North America each week. Next year, this number might even reach 100 flights. Also, through partner airlines, EVA Air can connect to over a hundred cities inside the US and Canada. This helps them get more customers who transfer flights through Taipei when traveling between North America and Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>Because of the AI industry, the "Texas Triangle" â€“ made up of Houston, Dallas, and Austin in Texas â€“ is growing fast. EVA Air is the only airline from Asia that flies to both Houston and Dallas in Texas. This means it can benefit greatly from the strong demand for passenger and cargo transport.</p>
            <p>China Airlines and Starlux Airlines have also announced that they will soon start direct flights to Phoenix. Phoenix is becoming an important technology center in the southwestern US. More business people are traveling there. In recent years, because TSMC built a factory there, the technology industry in the area has been growing strong.</p>
            <p>China Airlines will start its direct flight from Taipei to Phoenix on December 3. These flights will go straight there and back without stopping, with 3 round-trip flights each week. Starlux Airlines plans to start flights to Phoenix on January 15 next year. At first, there will be 3 flights per week. From March 2026, there will be 4 flights per week.</p>
            <p>China Airlines said that TSMC is a very large company in the world's semiconductor industry. It is also an important customer for China Airlines. Since 2021, China Airlines has helped TSMC with more than 20 special flights or cargo bookings. These were for trips between Taiwan and places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Kumamoto.</p>
            <p>China Airlines flies to New York, Los Angeles, Ontario, San Francisco, Seattle, and Vancouver in North America. With the new Phoenix flights, they will have about 40 round-trip flights each week.</p>
            <p>China Airlines also said it plans to add more flights to New York over time. Next year, it will move to Terminal 1 at New York's JFK Airport. It has also partnered with Southwest Airlines, which has the most domestic flights in the US. In the future, people can use a "through ticket" service to connect to many cities across the US with Southwest Airlines.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines said its North American destinations include Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Ontario, California. Currently, it has 10 flights to Los Angeles each week. There is one flight every day from Taipei to San Francisco and one every day from Taipei to Seattle. There are also 4 flights each week to Ontario, California. Starlux Airlines also works with American Airlines. This means travelers can use American Airlines' flights inside the US to connect to more cities in America.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese airlines are adding many more flights to the US. Some people worry that there might be too many flights for the number of passengers. But airlines explain that Chinese airlines have fewer flights to the US because the relationship between the US and China is not as good. These Chinese airlines are now focusing more on flights to Europe. So, with more Taiwanese companies investing in the US, the need for travel from Taiwan to the US is still high. However, on some routes where there is a lot of competition, ticket prices might go down during less busy times.</p>
            <p>Also, an experienced tour guide from a Taiwanese travel agency told CNA that before the pandemic, both European and US travel tours were popular. But after the pandemic, travel to Europe quickly became popular again. However, group travel to the US has not returned to normal. They think this is because inflation in the US is bad, and travel costs have gone up a lot. Tour prices have increased by about 30% to 40%. This has affected how much Taiwanese travelers can spend. It remains to be seen if new US flights from Taiwanese airlines will start a new trend of popular travel to the US.</p>
