            <h1>International Court to Announce First Climate Change Advisory Opinion; Key Points of Dispute at a Glance</h1>
            <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will share its first "advisory opinion" on climate change today. Many people think this is a very important moment for international law. Agence France-Presse (AFP) has listed 5 main points of discussion.</p>
            <p>This is the biggest case the International Court has ever heard. Judges have read thousands of pages of written statements and listened to spoken arguments for two weeks.</p>
            <p>This opinion will be released at 1 PM Greenwich Mean Time today (9 PM Taiwan time). It is expected to be hundreds of pages long. It will explain what countries must do to stop climate change and what will happen to countries that cause a lot of pollution.</p>
            <p><b>Why do we need legal rules?</b> This is the main point of the case and the first question the International Court needs to answer about countries' responsibilities for climate change. The judges want to combine different environmental laws into one final set of international rules.</p>
            <p>Countries that pollute a lot say this action is not needed. They believe the rules from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are enough.</p>
            <p>But others think the International Court should set broader standards. These standards should include human rights law and ocean law.</p>
            <p><b>What will be the results?</b> The second question for the judges is more difficult. It asks what legal results major countries that cause climate change will face.</p>
            <p>Deciding who is responsible has always been a sensitive topic in climate talks. However, at the UN climate meeting in 2022, rich countries agreed to create a fund. This fund will help countries that are easily affected by climate change deal with problems caused by past pollution.</p>
            <p>But many countries that pollute a lot say that climate change is a global problem. It affects different places in different ways, so it's impossible to blame single countries.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, some refer to a basic rule of international law: "where there is a right, there is a remedy." This means if someone is responsible, they must pay for the damage.</p>
            <p><b>Harmful or not harmful?</b> Another important point is about a legal idea called the "no-harm rule." This is a key principle in international law. Simply put, it means one country should not allow activities within its borders that could harm another country.</p>
            <p>Large polluting countries argue that this rule does not apply to climate change. They say it's impossible to find one specific source that caused harm to another country. Other countries, however, say that climate change should not be an exception to this rule.</p>
            <p><b>When did countries know they were causing harm?</b> One basic argument the judges heard during the discussions was about when governments first knew that greenhouse gas emissions were harming the Earth. This could affect when any payments for damage should start.</p>
            <p><b>Future Generations.</b> One reason the International Court is hearing this case is because young climate justice activists pushed for it. One of their main demands is "fairness for all generations."</p>
            <p>Namibia, a country in West Africa, said that "the effects of climate change are not limited by time." The worst effects will impact people decades or even centuries later.</p>
            <p>But developed countries argue that the rights of people not yet born are not valid under international law.</p>

            <h1>South Korean Woman Sentenced for Biting Off Attacker's Tongue; 61-Year-Old Case Reopened by Court</h1>
            <p>(CNA, Seoul, July 23, from foreign news) A South Korean court today reopened a very old case from 61 years ago. In that case, a woman was found guilty for defending herself from sexual violence. She decided to ask for a new trial because of the recent #MeToo movement.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that in 1964, a 19-year-old woman named Choi Mal-ja was attacked by a 21-year-old man in Gimhae City, South Korea.</p>
            <p>Court records show that the man pushed her to the ground and forced his tongue into her mouth. To try and get free, Choi Mal-ja bit off about 1.5 centimeters of the man's tongue.</p>
            <p>This case became one of the most argued-about sexual violence rulings in South Korea. The attacker was only given a 6-month prison sentence, suspended for 2 years, for illegal entry and threats. He was not punished for attempted rape.</p>
            <p>However, Choi Mal-ja was found guilty of causing serious injury and was sentenced to 10 months in prison, suspended for 2 years.</p>
            <p>At that time, the court said her act of fighting back "went beyond what is allowed for self-defense by law."</p>
            <p>In 2017, the #MeToo movement spread around the world. This made people pay attention to Choi Mal-ja's case again after many years. It also inspired her to seek justice for what happened to her.</p>
            <p>In South Korea, large protests for women's rights led to many changes in the system. These included protecting the right to abortion and making punishments for secret filming crimes stricter.</p>
            <p>Choi Mal-ja asked for a new trial in 2020, but a lower court first said no. After many years of effort and appeals, the Supreme Court of South Korea finally decided in 2024 that the case could be reopened.</p>
            <p>Today, before the new trial at the Busan District Court, Choi Mal-ja told reporters, "For 61 years, the country made me live like a criminal."</p>
            <p>She said she hopes future generations can "live in a world without sexual violence, where they have human rights and happy lives."</p>
