            <h1>Council of Mainland Affairs: China takes the big recall very seriously</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's recall vote is happening on July 26. A member of the DPP party, Hong Jian-yi, said on July 23 that a Chinese group in Dongguan is offering cheap flights. These flights are for Taiwanese business people and their families to return to Taiwan before the recall vote. Liang Wen-jie, a spokesperson for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said today that getting these business people to come back probably won't help much. But he said it clearly shows that China is taking this big recall vote very seriously. He added that China's effort for this vote is as strong as for a presidential election.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-jie said this at a regular press conference today when asked about the issue. He said that the Straits Exchange Foundation checked with related groups. It seems that staff from the Dongguan Taiwanese Business Association sent out this message using the association's name. They are still checking for more information about what is behind it.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-jie noted that the timing is very specific, just a few days before the big recall vote. In the past, cheap flights were usually offered only for presidential elections. This year is different. There has never been a summer special offer for returning to Taiwan before; this is the first time.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-jie stated that not only in Dongguan, but Chinese offices in other places also used local Taiwanese business associations to get Taiwanese business people to come back and vote. However, he thinks this won't have a big effect. But China's orders to mobilize are as strong as during a presidential election. This can be seen from China's news, important media articles, several press conferences by China's Taiwan Affairs Office, and now this local mobilization. It shows they are very serious about this recall.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-jie emphasized that the recall is a matter for Taiwanese people. It is up to the people to decide who should be recalled and who should not. China should not get involved.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien-chen comes from behind to beat former Indian top player, advances to China Open badminton quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen, Taiwan's top badminton player, won his match today. He played in the Round of 16 at the BWF China Open. He lost the first game 18-21 but then won the next two games 21-15 and 21-8. He came back to beat Prannoy, a good player from India. Chou is now the only Taiwanese player in the men's singles quarterfinals.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen is 35 years old. He played against Prannoy H. S., who is 33 years old and ranked 35th in the world. Before this match, they had played 13 times. Chou had won 7 times, and Prannoy had won 6 times. So, Chou had a small lead in their past matches.</p>
            <p>In the first game today, Chou Tien-chen started behind. He caught up to 9-9, but then Prannoy scored 6 points in a row and pulled ahead. Near the end of the game, Chou came back from 13-19 to 18-19. But he still lost the first game.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Chou Tien-chen started well and led 5-1. After that, both players scored back and forth. But when the score was 13-13, Chou chose to attack faster. He successfully scored 6 points in a row. This helped him win the second game.</p>
            <p>In the important third game, Chou Tien-chen had a lot of energy. He started by scoring 8-2. Then his lead grew bigger and bigger. In the middle of the game, he was far ahead with a score of 17-5. He easily won the third game and the match.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen told a reporter that he made too many mistakes in the first game. In the next two games, he tried hard to fix them and played the way he wanted to. He said, "I just told myself not to give up, no matter the score. Just follow the plan and get one point at a time."</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen is now in the quarterfinals. Next, he will play against Kunlavut Vitidsarn from Thailand, who is currently the world's top player. They have played 5 times before. Chou has won 3 times, and Kunlavut has won 2 times. The last time they played was in June this year at the Indonesia Open, where Chou won in two straight games.</p>
            <p>Besides Chou Tien-chen, another Taiwanese men's singles player, Lin Chun-yi, also played. He fought for 1.5 hours against Anders Antonsen from Denmark but lost 19-21, 22-20, 20-22. Li Jia-hao also lost 1-2 to Wang Zheng-xing from China.</p>

            <h1>China's "Anti-Involution" Effect in Solar Energy: Silicon Wafer Prices Stop Falling and Soar</h1>
            <p>The Chinese government is trying to stop "involution" in the solar panel making industry. "Involution" means that companies compete too much by lowering prices, which hurts everyone. Because of this, companies are making less and not fighting on price. People in the market now expect prices to go up. So, the prices of silicon materials and silicon wafers have stopped falling and are now rising sharply. However, some experts say that the main problem for the solar market in the long term is not enough demand. This problem cannot be solved just by stopping "involution."</p>
            <p>Chinese news reports from Futures Daily and Time Finance say that prices for polysilicon and other silicon materials, which are key parts for solar panels, went up a lot in July. This caused silicon wafer prices to go up too.</p>
            <p>The reports state that since July, people have expected a new policy to stop "involution." This made people feel positive about the market. Polysilicon futures started to rise quickly. Yesterday morning, the main futures contract went up again to its highest possible price for the day. It went over 50,000 Chinese Yuan (about 205,000 New Taiwan Dollars). So far, polysilicon futures have gone up for five weeks in a row, with a total increase of over 60% in one month.</p>
            <p>The Silicon Industry Branch of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association said today that strong market feelings made silicon wafer prices go up this week. For supply, the price of the raw material, polysilicon, went up a lot. Silicon wafer makers raised their prices because their costs were higher. Also, plans to cut production at the start of the month worked, so there was a little less supply in the market. For demand, companies that make solar cells accepted higher-priced orders and bought more.</p>
            <p>Before this, on July 18, the Silicon Industry Branch reported that companies at all parts of the supply chain had reduced their production. This was to fix the problem of too much supply and not enough demand. The amount of industrial silicon, polysilicon, and silicon wafers being made each month reached all-time lows: 41.9%, 38.6%, and 44.3% respectively.</p>
            <p>The report also used data from InfoLink Consulting, a company that advises on renewable energy. It showed that by July 23, silicon wafer prices had gone up by more than 20% since the start of the month. Market rumors say that new prices from leading companies show silicon wafer prices have gone up by 60% compared to the start of the month.</p>
            <p>Li Xunlei, the chief economist at Zhongtai International, said that people are expecting too much from the "anti-involution" policy right now. This is different from the supply-side reforms 10 years ago. This new "anti-involution" movement is part of building a single national market. It uses market rules and legal ideas to manage the industry better. It helps older, less efficient factories close down in an orderly way. It also focuses on fair competition and market order.</p>
            <p>Li Xunlei believes that this "anti-involution" is mainly to stop local governments from investing without thinking, and to avoid making too many things. But not having enough demand is a long-term problem that affects the whole structure of the market. This cannot be solved just by stopping "involution."</p>
            <p>The Silicon Industry Branch also pointed out that even though polysilicon prices have gone up, the basic situation of the market is weak. Supply and demand have not truly gotten better. For a short time, silicon material prices will keep going up a little. The prices will only truly become strong when some silicon wafer companies are forced to stop or reduce production. This will happen because their raw material costs are too high and the prices they sell their products for are too low.</p>
