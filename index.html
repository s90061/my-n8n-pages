            <h1>Reuters: US State Department Spokesperson Chosen by Trump as Deputy UN Ambassador</h1>
            <p>US President Trump announced today on social media that he has chosen Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, to be the next US Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Tammy Bruce has been the spokesperson for the State Department since President Trump started his term in January this year.</p>
            <p>In his social media post, Trump announced Bruce's new role and said she had done "excellent" work as the State Department spokesperson.</p>
            <p>Tammy Bruce has supported the Trump government's foreign policy. This includes rules about immigration and canceling visas. She also supported how the US reacted to the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas. She also defended a plan to send aid to Gaza, which many people criticized.</p>
            <p>Before this, Tammy Bruce worked for more than 20 years as a writer and commentator on political news for Fox News.</p>

            <h1>Explosion at Hezbollah Weapons Storage Area Kills 6 Lebanese Soldiers</h1>
            <p>The Lebanese army said that six soldiers died today after an explosion at a weapons storage place near the border with Israel. A source from the army said the soldiers were taking away ammunition from a Hezbollah base.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Lebanese army has been working in the south of the country. Their job is to destroy the buildings and equipment of Hezbollah, a group supported by Iran. This is part of a peace agreement made last year that ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, the Lebanese government decided to take away Hezbollah's weapons. They asked the army to make a plan to finish this by the end of the year. However, Hezbollah said it would not follow this decision from the government, which was made under strong pressure from the United States. Iran, which supports Hezbollah, also said today that it is against this action.</p>
            <p>The Lebanese army released a statement saying that six soldiers died. This happened when they were checking and removing weapons from a storage area in Wadi Zibqin, in the Tyre area, close to the Israeli border.</p>
            <p>A military source, who wished to remain unnamed, told AFP news agency that the explosion happened inside a "Hezbollah military area." The source added that the soldiers were "clearing away ammunition and bombs that had not exploded, left over from a recent war."</p>

            <h1>London Police Arrest Over 365 People for Supporting Banned Pro-Palestine Group</h1>
            <p>Today, police in London, UK, arrested at least 365 people. They were arrested for supporting a group called "Palestine Action." This was the newest and largest protest since the British government said last month that this group was illegal under anti-terrorism laws.</p>
            <p>The Metropolitan Police in London said they arrested hundreds of people for "supporting a banned group." Many people think this was one of the biggest number of arrests ever made in London at one time.</p>
            <p>Police also arrested seven other people for different crimes, like attacking police officers. No one was seriously hurt.</p>
            <p>The British government made "Palestine Action" an illegal group in early July. This happened because some of its members went into a Royal Air Force base in southern England and damaged two airplanes. The damage cost about 7 million British Pounds, which is around 280 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Before today's protest, the UK Home Office repeated that Palestine Action is also thought to have done other "serious attacks." These attacks included "violence, causing big harm, and widespread damage to property."</p>
            <p>However, groups that work for human rights and the environment, like the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Greenpeace, have criticized the UK government's actions. They said it was "too strict" and that it could harm people's right to speak freely.</p>
