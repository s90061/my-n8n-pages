            <h1>Teng Kai-Wei Returns to Major League Baseball, Will Start Against Rockies on September 1st (US Time)</h1>
            <p>Today, the San Francisco Giants of MLB played against the Baltimore Orioles at home. Before the game, the team announced some changes. Left-handed pitcher Carson Whisenhunt went on the 15-day injured list. Right-handed pitcher Teng Kai-Wei was called up to the Major Leagues. This is the third time Teng Kai-Wei has been called up to the Major Leagues during his time in the US. He will start an away game against the Colorado Rockies on September 1st, US time.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-Wei returned to the Major Leagues today and was back at the San Francisco Giants' home stadium. This is his second time being called up to the Major Leagues in August, and he is scheduled to be a starting pitcher. The team has announced that he will start the game against the Colorado Rockies on September 1st.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-Wei first joined the Major Leagues in March last year. At that time, he played as a long relief pitcher. Before that, he was always a starting pitcher in Triple-A, so he had to get used to pitching from the bullpen again. In August this year, he returned to the Major Leagues again and started games. He played in 4 games, pitched 13.1 innings, and had a record of 1 win and 3 losses. On August 8th, he got his first career win at home against the Nationals.</p>
            <p>The Giants' new left-handed pitcher, Carson Whisenhunt, is now on the 15-day injured list. Whisenhunt joined the Major Leagues in July, was sent back to Triple-A for a short time, and then was called back up to replace the injured Landen Roupp.</p>
            <p>Recently, the Dongyuan Elementary School baseball team, who won the Little League World Series in Williamsport, was invited to the MLB Giants' home stadium. Giants pitcher Spencer Bivens recorded a video to let the young players cheer for their older teammate, Teng Kai-Wei.</p>
            <p>On September 1st, the "North America Taiwan All-Star Baseball League" in the San Francisco Bay Area will hold a Minor League Taiwan Day event with the San Jose Giants, a Single-A team of the San Francisco Giants. Taiwanese people living abroad will also bring cheering towels to support Teng Kai-Wei in his away game.</p>

            <h1>Alcaraz Wins in Straight Sets, Reaches US Open Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>Today, Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz won easily against French player Arthur Rinderknech in straight sets. He has now reached the quarterfinals of the US Open for the fourth time.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the second-seeded Alcaraz played against the strong Rinderknech. Alcaraz won the match with scores of 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, and 6-4 to move forward.</p>
            <p>After the match, Alcaraz said, "The first set was very close at the start, but then I found my rhythm and tried to use my chances well. I hit good, aggressive shots. After the second set, I got a good rhythm and tried to keep it going."</p>
            <p>Today, Alcaraz hit 36 winning shots and only made 11 unforced errors. He has not lost a single set in this tournament so far. This is the first time he has reached the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams in the same year.</p>
            <p>"I think my playing style fits well with the energy of New York."</p>
            <p>Next, he will play against Jiri Lehecka from the Czech Republic, who is the 20th seed. They will play for a spot in the semifinals.</p>

            <h1>Washington Post Reveals Trump's Gaza Rebuilding Plan: US to Manage for at Least Ten Years, Relocate Palestinians</h1>
            <p>Today, the Washington Post reported that a plan for Gaza after the war is being discussed within former President Trump's government. This plan suggests that the US would manage the area, which has suffered much from war, for at least 10 years. It would also move people from Gaza to new places and rebuild the area to become a tourist spot and a center for making goods.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post looked at a 38-page document about the plan. It says that during the rebuilding, the 2 million people living in the Gaza Strip would at least temporarily "voluntarily" go to other countries or be moved to special areas inside Gaza.</p>
            <p>Reuters had previously reported about a plan to set up large camps called "Humanitarian Transit Areas" for Palestinians. This work might also happen outside of Gaza. This plan is presented under the name "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation," which is a group that people have many questions about.</p>
            <p>According to the Washington Post, people who own land in Gaza will get "digital certificates." These certificates will give them the right to rebuild their homes and land. Every Palestinian who leaves will get $5,000 in cash, help with rent for 4 years, and enough food for one year.</p>
            <p>The report states that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is developing this plan. Its name is the "Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust" (GREAT Trust).</p>
            <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation works with the Israeli military. American security and logistics companies deliver food to Gaza. This plan is supported by the Trump government and Israel. Israel says that the UN's way of giving aid allows fighters to take the supplies.</p>
            <p>In early August, the United Nations said that since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started its work in May, over 1,000 people have died trying to get supplies. Most of them were shot by Israeli soldiers near the Foundation's locations.</p>
            <p>The White House and the State Department did not immediately answer questions about the plan. However, this Gaza rebuilding plan seems to be similar to what Trump has said before.</p>
            <p>On February 4th, Trump first said publicly that the US should "take over" Gaza. After moving Palestinians, he said it should be rebuilt into "The Riviera of the Middle East."</p>
