            <h1>Munich Stores Stop Selling Beer and Chips at Night; Student Protests Succeed in Halting Ban</h1>
            <p>Munich, Germany (CNA) â€“ The government in Munich recently started enforcing a rule more strictly. This rule stopped convenience stores in university areas from selling chips after 8 PM and bottled beer after 10 PM. This made students and store owners unhappy. Students protested by holding up beer and chips, shouting, "I love beer and chips!" Because of the strong disagreement, the local government decided to stop the night ban for now.</p>
            <p>Starting in August, the Munich government began to strictly enforce the "Bavarian Store Hours Law." This law requires five convenience stores near the university that stay open late to stop selling chips after 8 PM and beer after 10 PM.</p>
            <p>In Germany, university buildings are often spread out among regular houses and shops in cities. Residents near the University of Munich (LMU) have complained for a long time that students gather at convenience stores after classes and are too noisy. They asked the police to control this. However, the strict new rule caused a strong reaction from shop owners.</p>
            <p>Nechirvan Al Bezihi, a convenience store owner, said that after 8 PM, he has to cover his chip shelves with a dark cloth. This is to stop customers from being "tempted" to ask to buy chips. Another owner, Shivan Beseh, said he is very worried about his business. He explained that most of his store's money comes from customers who buy drinks and snacks after 10 PM.</p>
            <p>Many students said that the ban is not fair and makes it difficult for young people who cannot afford to go to bars often. They believe chips help them feel full more than candy and are better with beer. Convenience stores were places where students could meet cheaply at night. They asked, "If even chips and beer are banned, where can we go?"</p>
            <p>Some students joined a protest organized by a small German political party called "Die Partei." They protested the night ban near the University of Munich, where the rules were strictly enforced. They held signs saying things like "Residents are annoying" and shouted, "Long live beer and chips!" Marie Burneleit, a city council member from the party, even joked in the city council that the government was making "chips their most important task."</p>
            <p>The ruling party, CSU, defended the ban. City council member Thomas Schmid criticized that buying alcohol late at night from convenience stores is a "wrong business model." He thought that not only convenience stores, but also some bars and restaurants should be responsible for the noise in the area.</p>
            <p>After receiving public criticism, the local government said that the night ban was not a new rule. Instead, it was an existing law that was being strictly enforced for the first time. According to the "Bavarian Store Hours Law," general shops can only be open from 6 AM to 8 PM. Only restaurants, bakeries, and flower shops are exceptions.</p>
            <p>In Munich, the largest city in Bavaria, it is common to see convenience stores (Kiosk) open late. For many years, they have operated in a grey area regarding opening hours. Many German states, including Berlin, changed their rules years ago. They now allow convenience stores that sell drinks and snacks to be open late at night.</p>
            <p>Facing the disagreement caused by the ban, Munich's Deputy Mayor, Dominik Krause, announced on August 19th that the rule stopping convenience stores from selling beer and chips late at night would be paused.</p>
            <p>Krause said that young people often do not have much money and cannot afford to go to bars. He added that affordable convenience stores are very important for people to meet and talk. At the same time, he stressed that residents' rights must be protected. He said, "Sidewalks cannot be full of broken glass, and people's doorsteps cannot be used as toilets." He warned that if problems with trash and noise continue to get worse, the strict "night beer and chips ban" could be put back into action at any time.</p>

            <h1>Israel: Starts First Steps to Take Gaza City; Controls Outskirts</h1>
            <p>Jerusalem (CNA) â€“ The Israeli army said today that it has started the first steps to take over Gaza City. It has called up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers to help with the full operation to take the city.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Israeli army spokesperson Effie Defrin told reporters: "We have begun the first steps and the first stage of our attack on Gaza City. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) now control the areas just outside Gaza City."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, approved the plan to take over Gaza City. He also gave permission to call up about 60,000 reserve soldiers for this task.</p>
            <p>Katz's decision was confirmed by his spokesperson to Agence France-Presse. This move puts more pressure on the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. At the same time, countries trying to arrange a ceasefire in the nearly two-year war in Gaza are waiting for Israel's official answer to their newest suggestions.</p>
