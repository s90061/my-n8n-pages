The U.S. government, under President Trump, has told Harvard University that it found the university treated Jewish and Israeli students unfairly, which goes against federal civil rights laws.

The Wall Street Journal saw a letter sent to Harvard's president, Alan Garber. The letter said that if Harvard does not change its ways immediately, it could lose all money from the federal government and hurt its relationship with the government.

The Trump administration concluded after an investigation that Harvard University did not protect Jewish students from being bothered.

**Canada Drops Digital Services Tax, US to Restart Trade Talks Immediately**

A White House economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, announced today that the United States will immediately restart trade talks with Canada. This comes after Canada decided not to put a new tax on American technology companies.

Hassett said on Fox News Channel that President Trump had asked Canada to remove this tax during a G7 meeting there. He added that since Canada has now agreed, talks can begin again.

Canada had planned to tax US tech companies, but they stopped it just hours before it was supposed to start. This was done to help stalled trade talks between the two countries move forward.
