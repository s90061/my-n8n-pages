Typhoon Danas brought strong winds and rain to Tainan on July 6th. The Central Weather Bureau reported average winds of 13-level. In Qigu District, gusts reached a very strong 16-level around 10 PM.

Many signs and trees were damaged. A guard room and movable toilets at a building site in Yongkang District were blown down. Police had to block off the area.

Over 30,000 homes in Tainan lost electricity. Power company workers are trying to fix the problem, but it is hard because of the strong winds and heavy rain. They will continue repairs when the weather gets better.

**NATO warns of Russia's role if China attacks Taiwan**

NATO leader Mark Rutte said in an interview that if China attacks Taiwan, China might ask Russia to start another conflict against NATO countries. He believes Chinese President Xi Jinping would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin first.

Rutte thinks that Xi would tell Putin, "I'm going to do this, and I need you to attack NATO land to keep them busy in Europe."

To stop this, Rutte said two things are needed: NATO must be strong so Russia is afraid to act, and NATO needs to work with countries in the Indo-Pacific region.

**Elon Musk plans new political party, faces criticism**

Elon Musk, a very rich businessman, has had disagreements with former US President Donald Trump. Now, Musk says he will start a new political party called "America Party." He asked people on his X platform (formerly Twitter) if they wanted a new party, and most said yes.

However, Steve Bannon, who used to be a main advisor for Trump, was very angry. He called Musk names and said he should be sent out of the country because he was not born in the US.

Musk replied to Bannon with strong words, saying Bannon would go to jail for a long time. Musk was born in South Africa but is a US citizen. He cannot run for president but can support other political parties.
