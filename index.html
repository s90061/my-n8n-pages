            <h1>Ministry of Finance Holds Lottery for Mobile Tax Filers Today; First Prize of NT$50,000 Can Be Checked on September 26th Afternoon</h1>
            <p>To encourage people to file their income tax using their mobile phones, the Ministry of Finance started a national lottery event. Today, a press conference was held for the public drawing. With a lawyer present, one winner of the top prize of NT$50,000 and other prizes were chosen randomly by computer. The list of winners will be announced on September 26th at 4 PM on social media and the official website. Winners have until January 2nd next year to claim their prizes. If someone does not claim their prize on time or cannot receive the SMS notification, they will lose their prize.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance explained that to encourage people to use their phones to file their income tax for the year 113, local tax offices across the country once again held the "Happy Mobile Tax Filing, Lucky Draw" event. There are a total of 19,586 prizes. These include 86 cash prizes and 19,500 e-voucher prizes. The list of winners will be announced on September 26th at 4 PM on the Ministry of Finance's Facebook page and the official websites of local tax offices. Everyone is welcome to check.</p>
            <p>The Southern Area National Tax Bureau said that this year's tax filing lottery is the "Mobile Tax Filing Prize." People who used their mobile phones to finish their income tax filing for the year 113 and checked the "agree" box can enter the lottery. Each household that filed tax gets one chance to win. For this event, more than 2.359 million people could enter the lottery. Today, 19,586 lucky winners were chosen. This includes one winner for the first prize of NT$50,000, five winners for the second prize of NT$20,000, ten winners for the third prize of NT$10,000, twenty winners for the fourth prize of NT$5,000, fifty winners for the fifth prize of NT$2,000, three thousand winners for the sixth prize of NT$500 e-vouchers, and sixteen thousand five hundred winners for the general prize of NT$200 e-vouchers.</p>
            <p>The Southern Area National Tax Bureau stated that there are 86 cash prizes. Winners will receive a registered letter with a notification. After receiving the notification, winners should mail their prize claim documents to the General Administration Division of the Southern Area National Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance by the deadline. The money will be put into the winner's bank account. For prizes over NT$20,000, 10% tax will be taken out first, as required by law, and then the rest of the money will be sent.</p>
            <p>The Southern Area National Tax Bureau also said that there are 19,500 e-voucher prizes. Winners will receive a message on their mobile phone number, which they used when filing their income tax for the year 113. This message will come from the government's special SMS platform (111). When winners get the message, they should follow the instructions in the message to find out how to get their prize on the Southern Area National Tax Bureau's official website. The deadline to get the prize is January 2nd next year. If someone does not get their prize on time or the message cannot be sent, they will lose their prize.</p>
            <p>The Southern Area National Tax Bureau wants to remind everyone that the tax office will never call winners and ask them to use an ATM to handle their bank account. They will also never ask for tax to be paid in advance. People should be careful to avoid scams.</p>

            <h1>DPP Shares Timeline of Landslide Dam Outflow; Green Party Members Ask Other Parties to Stop Arguing</h1>
            <p>A landslide dam at Matai'an Stream caused serious damage when it overflowed. Today, Huang Tzu-yi, the deputy head of the DPP's news department, showed a timeline of the dam overflowing on Facebook. He criticized the KMT and TPP for making political arguments and spreading false information during a natural disaster. He asked, "Aren't you afraid of bad consequences?" DPP legislators Chen Pei-yu and Wang Shih-chien also asked the other parties to stop their political arguments.</p>
            <p>Huang Tzu-yi wrote on Facebook that the Matai'an landslide dam overflowed, causing many deaths and injuries downstream. At first, KMT legislator Fu Kun-chi blamed the central government. This morning, TPP caucus whip Huang Kuo-chang held a press conference and said the central government was not doing its job.</p>
            <p>Huang Tzu-yi explained what the central Ministry of Agriculture did after finding the Matai'an landslide dam. From July 21st to 26th, they saw signs of it forming and did first checks. From July 26th to 31st, they started aerial surveys, made models of the area, and did initial risk checks. From August 7th to 12th, they talked with local governments, held expert meetings, and planned for people to move away if needed. On August 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture created a "special team." This team had three smaller groups with clear jobs (dam/engineering, and moving people) and a schedule.</p>
            <p>Huang Tzu-yi said that after Typhoon Krosa came, at 11 AM on September 21st, the Forestry Bureau told the Hualien County Government that there was a yellow alert for the Matai'an landslide dam. At 7 AM on September 22nd, they told the Hualien County Government about a red alert for the Matai'an landslide dam and "suggested that the Hualien County Government start moving people away from the affected areas downstream." From midnight on September 23rd to 12:10 PM, they told the Hualien County Government five times about the possible time the Matai'an landslide dam would overflow. They also suggested that the Hualien County Government quickly start local evacuation and close the Matai'an Stream bridge.</p>
            <p>Huang Tzu-yi stressed that at 3 PM yesterday, they told the Hualien County Government that the Matai'an landslide dam had overflowed. The Ministry of Agriculture has told the Hualien County Government 9 times since September 21st. After the disaster happened, the Minister of Transportation quickly drove from Taipei to Hualien. He told Taiwan Railways Administration staff to repair the railway overnight. By 7 AM this morning, the section from Fenglin to Ruisui and its signals were fixed. By 8 AM this morning, all railway lines were open again. The Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation quickly made a plan to fix roads and hopes to open Provincial Highway 9 soon.</p>
            <p>DPP legislator Chen Pei-yu spoke before a party meeting. She questioned if Fu Kun-chi was trying to blame others for his wife, Hualien County Magistrate Hsu Chen-wei.</p>
            <p>About Fu Kun-chi saying the central government used online trolls to attack, Chen Pei-yu said that Fu Kun-chi knows best how many online trolls were in many Hualien groups last night trying to help the Fu family. She also said that an account named KCF was spreading false information and taking advantage of the disaster. Hsu Chen-wei went to Korea before September 22nd and only returned after Minister of the Interior Liu Shih-fang called her. Isn't this true? It should be very clear who is an online troll, who is spreading false information, and who is trying to control public opinion.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-yu said that rescue work is still going on. She asked the KMT and TPP to stop their political arguments. The DPP is working hard to help, and the government is working hard to help, but the KMT and TPP are just making political arguments. She feels very sad about this.</p>
            <p>DPP legislator Wang Shih-chien spoke before a party meeting. He said that Fu Kun-chi and Hsu Chen-wei are fully responsible but they are blaming the central government. This is not how a local leader or a member of parliament should act. If they made a mistake, they should admit it. If they were careless, they were careless. They should not keep blaming the central government. After the disaster, they should stop arguing.</p>

            <h1>American Airlines Must Pay Almost NT$300 Million for Not Helping a Passenger Who Had Two Strokes</h1>
            <p>On September 23rd, in Los Angeles, a male passenger in California had two strokes on an American Airlines international flight in 2021. The flight crew did not follow the company's rules, which caused a delay in him getting medical help. A jury in court decided that American Airlines must pay 9.6 million US dollars (about 300 million New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>The "Los Angeles Times" reported that according to federal court papers, this happened in November 2021. At that time, Jesus Plasencia, a 67-year-old chef, and his wife were flying from Miami, Florida, in the United States to Madrid, Spain.</p>
            <p>The court papers said that when the plane was still at the gate, Mr. Plasencia had a "mini-stroke." He could not speak for a short time and could not pick up his phone. His wife told the flight attendants and the pilot. But the pilot did not listen to the wife's worries. Instead of telling medical staff and following company rules, the pilot "joked with Mr. Plasencia and let him fly."</p>
            <p>The court papers said that after the plane took off, Mr. Plasencia had another stroke. When the plane arrived in Spain, Mr. Plasencia was very sick and stayed in the hospital for more than three weeks before he could go back to the US. The court papers show that he can no longer speak or write. He needs care at home all day and intensive physical therapy.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of this month, a jury in a California federal court decided that American Airlines must pay 9.6 million US dollars because its employees did not follow the company's rules.</p>
            <p>According to this lawsuit, which was filed in 2023, after Mr. Plasencia had a stroke during the flight, the crew asked other passengers to watch him. But they did not tell the pilot that it was a medical emergency, so the flight did not land early.</p>
            <p>The court papers said that Mr. Plasencia's wife claimed that because American Airlines' crew did not follow the rules, Mr. Plasencia was delayed in getting medical help for almost 8 hours. If he had gotten medical help sooner, his condition might have been very different.</p>
            <p>American Airlines released a statement saying, "The safety and well-being of passengers are the company's top priority." The statement said: "The company respects the jury's decision but does not agree with the verdict and is currently thinking about what to do next."</p>
            <p>The lawyer for the person who sued said that American Airlines did not follow its rules for strokes, which say that they should give medical help right away and land the plane. He said sadly, "American Airlines' response to such medical emergencies is so bad, it's shocking."</p>
