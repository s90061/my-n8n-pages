            <h1>Under US-China Competition, ByteDance Chip Designers Reportedly Moved to Singapore Department</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the matter, that last week, chip design employees of ByteDance, the Chinese company behind the popular short video platform TikTok, suddenly found themselves moved to a department in Singapore. However, many of these employees work in Beijing or Shanghai.</p>
            <p>Two of the sources said that these employees learned about the change when they were moved to a new group on the company's internal messaging platform. They then had to report to a unit in Singapore. The report suggests this move could help ByteDance use advanced semiconductor technology even with the tense relationship between the US and China.</p>
            <p>Many global technology companies, including ByteDance, are working hard to develop their own special chips (ASIC). This is to reduce how much they rely on suppliers like Nvidia, a top company for AI chips. But since late 2023, US rules have made it impossible for Chinese companies to have TSMC make advanced AI chips that are more powerful than certain limits.</p>
            <p>ByteDance does not currently have TSMC make its chips. But last year, sources said that ByteDance was working with the American chip design company Broadcom to create an advanced AI processor, which TSMC would then make.</p>
            <p>The sources did not say the name of the Singapore department where ByteDance's chip design employees were moved. Reuters also could not find out how many employees are now in this department. ByteDance did not reply to requests for comments.</p>
            <p>ByteDance has several large data centers in Singapore, and its CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is also from Singapore. Also, business records show that ByteDance started a company called Picoheart in Singapore in December 2023. This company gained attention last year for buying a 9.5% share of Innostar, a Chinese memory chip maker.</p>

            <h1>TBC Promises to Bring Back 4 Channels on September 5th Evening, Hopes to Continue Talks</h1>
            <p>The National Communications Commission (NCC) announced today that after two meetings to settle a disagreement, Taiwan Broadband Communications (TBC) group's cable TV will restart broadcasting four channels, including Discovery. In response, Chunghwa Telecom (Chung Chia Group) said that both sides have temporarily agreed on a short-term license for the channels this year. They will prioritize what is best for their customers. TBC said they will keep talking to reach a full agreement.</p>
            <p>On August 6th, the TBC group announced that its cable TV services, including Nan Taoyuan, Beishi, Xinhe, Jiyuan, and Qun Jian, would stop showing signals for four channels: Discovery (CH19), GTV One (CH27), GTV General (CH28), and TVBS Entertainment (CH42).</p>
            <p>The NCC explained today that the five companies that asked for help (like Nan Taoyuan) and Global Digital Media, part of the Chung Chia Group, actively looked for a solution during their meetings. After many discussions, they reached an agreement. Today, the four channelsâ€”GTV One, GTV General, TVBS Entertainment, and Discoveryâ€”will start broadcasting again.</p>
            <p>TBC explained that they are thankful to the government body for understanding that the main issue was about "the legal rights to broadcast the channels." They are also grateful for the help in getting the license. TBC will continue discussions about the related problems.</p>
            <p>Chung Chia Group also stated in a press release that with the active help of the NCC, both sides have temporarily agreed on a short-term license for the channels this year. TBC has promised to restart broadcasting the four channels by 6 PM on September 5th.</p>
            <p>Chung Chia Group said they thank the NCC for working hard to help the industry grow and to protect customers' rights by stepping in to solve the signal problem. They will continue to act as a good channel agent, help keep the market fair for channel licenses, and work to meet the different viewing needs of various customers. They will also keep working for the good growth of the industry and for their company to last a long time.</p>

            <h1>"The Trickster King â€“ New Edition of Qiu Wangshe" Returns to the Stage, Showing the Spirit of Taiwanese People</h1>
            <p>After eight years, the Taiwanese stage play "The Trickster King â€“ New Edition of Qiu Wangshe" is coming back to the theater. It was written and directed by Wang Rong-yu and Chi Wei-jan, who have both won national arts awards. Wang Rong-yu said that "The Trickster King" creates an image of Taiwanese people, which means "always being yourself."</p>
            <p>Wang Rong-yu explained that when Gold Braid Theatre created this Taiwanese stage play in 2017, one goal was to shape the idea of "Taiwanese people." He said it shows that "no matter what dreams and goals you have, you can always be yourself and bloom like a unique flower." Wang Rong-yu mentioned that "The Trickster King" uses humor to connect with stories of ancestors from 100 years ago. He believes that "maybe future generations will use the same way to understand the problems and chaos of our time."</p>
            <p>"The Trickster King â€“ New Edition of Qiu Wangshe" tells the story of Qiu Wangshe, a very smart but carefree man. He likes to play tricks on people in his village by using their weaknesses. He faces a bet with the government official's assistant and the tricks of Bai Zai Qi. There is also a dangerous fight between two rival groups, Zhang and Quan, about to happen. Through all this, he manages to solve the problems between old enemies and find a happy ending for lovers.</p>
            <p>Gold Braid Theatre's Taiwanese stage play "The Trickster King â€“ New Edition of Qiu Wangshe" will be performed from September 19th to September 21st at the main performance hall of the Taiwan Traditional Theatre Center.</p>
