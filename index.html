            <h1>Trump Meets Erdogan to Talk About F-35 Jets and Russia Energy</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House today. Before the meeting, Trump said they would discuss selling F-35 fighter jets and trade. Regarding the situation between Russia and Ukraine, Trump believed Erdogan could be very helpful. He hoped Turkey would stop buying energy from Russia.</p>
            <p>Trump and Erdogan had a meeting in the Oval Office. They spoke to reporters before their meeting. This was Erdogan's first visit to the White House since 2019.</p>
            <p>Trump answered questions from reporters. He said they would talk about F-35 fighter jets. He knew Erdogan wanted to buy F-35s and believed Erdogan "will succeed in getting what he wants."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "He (Erdogan) needs some things, and we need some things. We will find a solution. You will know by the end of today."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that during Trump's first time as president, the U.S. stopped Turkey, a NATO friend, from getting F-35 fighter jets. This was because Turkey bought an air defense system from Russia. U.S. officials were worried that if Turkey used Russia's S-400 missile system, it could collect information about the F-35's features. This information might then go to Russia.</p>
            <p>On the issue of Russia and Ukraine, Trump thought that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy respected Erdogan. Trump believed Erdogan could have a big impact if he wanted to.</p>
            <p>Trump said that if Erdogan helped, "the best thing to do is not to buy oil and natural gas from Russia."</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has lasted for more than three and a half years. Since Trump came back to the White House, he has tried to make Russia and Ukraine agree to a permanent ceasefire. But so far, Russia has not agreed to any big changes.</p>
            <p>Trump had said many times before that trading land between Russia and Ukraine would be key to ending the war. However, his view changed this week after he met with Zelenskyy at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that he thinks Ukraine can get its original land back with help from the European Union. Russia is having big money problems, and "now is the time for Ukraine to act."</p>

            <h1>South Korean President: North Korea Can Almost Hit the U.S. with Nuclear Missiles</h1>
            <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung said in New York, USA, today that North Korea is developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that can carry nuclear weapons to attack the U.S. He said they are in the last steps of making these missiles. However, North Korea has not yet fully learned how to make the missiles come back into the Earth's atmosphere safely.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that President Lee Jae-myung was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. He made these comments while leading a meeting at the New York Stock Exchange to invite businesses. He also said he would try his best to lower security risks from North Korea. This is to help South Korea get more investments and grow its economy.</p>
            <p>President Lee Jae-myung explained that North Korea "is continuously developing ICBMs that can reach the U.S. and carry one nuclear bomb to attack the U.S." He believes they are doing this either to talk with the U.S. or to make their own government stronger.</p>
            <p>He also said that North Korea has not finished developing these missiles yet. But it is in the final stages. The only thing left is the technology to re-enter the atmosphere, and this part "will likely be solved soon."</p>
            <p>Last year, North Korea tested its biggest ICBM, the Hwasong-19. It flew very high into space. Experts at that time said this type of missile could hit any target in the U.S. But they still doubted if North Korea could guide the missile well and protect its warhead when it came back through the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>President Lee Jae-myung said that Pyongyang clearly has enough nuclear weapons to keep its government in power. He called for talks to stop North Korea from making more nuclear weapons to sell to other countries. He also said again that U.S. President Donald Trump would be "the only one" who could talk with North Korea.</p>

            <h1>President of Paraguay: It's Time for Taiwan to Join the UN and Fix Old Wrongs</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's friends are speaking louder at the 80th United Nations General Assembly debate. Paraguay's President Peña said it is time to fix wrongs that have lasted for decades and give the Republic of China (Taiwan) a place in the UN. President Hilda C. Heine of the Marshall Islands also said that UN Resolution 2758 does not say who should sit in the UN with a country's name card.</p>
            <p>The main debate at the UN General Assembly started on September 23. U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke there. Leaders from countries that are friends with Taiwan and those that support Taiwan also gave speeches. They talked about the situation in the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan joining the UN.</p>
            <p>On September 24, Paraguay's President Santiago Peña Palacios gave a two-minute speech. He talked about the friendship between their two countries and Taiwan joining the UN. Since President Peña took office, he has spoken about Taiwan for a long time at the UN General Assembly for three meetings in a row.</p>
            <p>President Peña said that Paraguay is proud to have a 67-year friendship with the Republic of China (Taiwan). This friendship is strong because both countries share democratic values and work together. It is not just about benefits, and he knows this decision costs money. But he said, "Believe me, doing the right thing is priceless."</p>
            <p>He pointed out that Paraguay is very worried about the growing tension in the Taiwan Strait. More aggressive military exercises, constant flying into air space, and strong words are making the situation more dangerous. This causes problems not just in East Asia, but for the whole world.</p>
            <p>President Peña said, "Everyone should not be afraid. Taiwan must have a place in this (UN) forum. I say again, Taiwan must have a place in this (UN) forum. This is about being fair. The UN system wrongly keeps Taiwan out. It is against the rules of the organization. 23 million good, hardworking, and kind people are still not treated as if they exist in the international system."</p>
            <p>He said that Taiwan's issues and its place in the world must be part of the Assembly's talks. Now is the time to remove the roots of injustice from many decades and give the Republic of China (Taiwan) a place in the United Nations.</p>
            <p>President Hilda C. Heine of the Marshall Islands has also often spoken at the UN about why Taiwan needs to be part of it.</p>
            <p>She said on September 24 that Taiwan, an island country, is still kept out of important global events by the UN system. Taiwan plays a big part for the Marshall Islands and the world in working together on technology, making regional peace, and helping with lasting development. However, UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 is still wrongly described as a UN rule for a "one China" idea. She said the UN organization has never been controlled in such a wrong way.</p>
            <p>President Heine said that the resolution does not say who should sit in the UN as a country's representative. It also does not allow anyone to take away a democratic country's power by force or threats. She added that the UN Secretary-General's office must stop treating people with Taiwan passports, including reporters, differently.</p>
            <p>She stressed that all member countries must understand that these actions and other political actions that wrongly use Resolution 2758, like attacking Taiwan or using threats, are against international law and fairness.</p>
