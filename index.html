            <h1>Ministry of Transportation Connects Companies to Help People Repair Their Homes</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and strong winds from the southwest affected the southern part of Taiwan. Some people's homes were badly damaged. The Ministry of Transportation said today that there are not enough workers or building materials right now. So, they have asked different groups to help connect people with companies. They hope this will help residents find workers and fix their homes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation posted on Facebook today that Vice Minister Chen Yen-po had a meeting yesterday. He brought together different departments to check on the repair work in the Tainan disaster area and plan for the future. They have already visited more than 100 damaged homes. They are also still counting how many workers and resources they have. They want to do their best to help people rebuild their homes quickly.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation explained that people cannot find workers to fix their homes because there are not enough workers, materials, or machines. The government has asked different ministries to help. Each ministry has been given an area to care for. The Ministry of Transportation is in charge of four areas in Tainan City: Xinying, Yanshui, Baihe, and Houbi.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that if you need to fix your home, you can first tell your local district chief. Then, the Ministry of Transportation will help you find a company. After that, you will talk with the company. Once you agree, you will sign a simple paper. The Ministry of Transportation's job is to connect people with companies, but they do not pay for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To make the rebuilding faster after the storm, the Ministry of Transportation also set some rules. Besides finding companies, they will first help fix old single-story houses and homes where the roof is gone, so people cannot live there. This is for quick help. Old materials like asbestos will be put in one place. The local office will then help take them away.</p>
