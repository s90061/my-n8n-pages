<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E9%9F%93%E5%9C%8B%E7%91%9C%E7%8D%B2%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%A4%A7%E9%87%8F%E8%BE%B2%E7%94%A2%E8%A8%82%E5%96%AE%E6%98%AF-%E7%B6%93%E6%BF%80%E7%B5%B1%E6%88%B0-%E8%98%87%E8%B2%9E%E6%98%8C-%E7%B8%BD%E9%AB%94%E7%9C%8B%E8%B5%B7%E4%BE%86%E5%B1%85%E5%BF%83%E5%8F%B5%E6%B8%AC-032831891.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan will combine two major exercises in July: the Hanguang Exercise and the Urban Resilience Exercise. Simply put, given the escalating military threats to Taiwan, if the military is engaged in combat and unable to assist, civilians must be prepared to "save their own hometowns" in the event of major disasters. National security officials stated that the goal for July is to inform the public that defense resilience is not solely the military's responsibility; every civilian partner, especially those in non-military sectors, must be mobilized.

National security officials explained that this year's combination of the Hanguang and Urban Resilience exercises aims to integrate the military's response to enemy forces with the non-military sector's emergency response capabilities. Therefore, July has been designated as "National Unity Month," with the theme "Team Taiwan, Stronger, Together."

A senior Ministry of Interior official stated that residents in nine districts â€“ Zhongzheng, Zhongshan, and Songshan in Taipei; Shalu, Qingshui, and Wuqi in Taichung; and West Central, East, and Shanhua in Tainan â€“ will participate in full evacuation drills. During these drills, civil defense teams, village and community chiefs, volunteer police, traffic volunteers, and firefighters, as well as management committees and general managers of apartment buildings, will guide residents to shelters. The Ministry of Interior will require all non-sensitive shelters in these nine districts to open their gates for public access. The official mentioned that recent news about this initiative led many people to check shelters late at night, only to find them closed, prompting online complaints.

Furthermore, the government will release a new version of the "Air Defense Evacuation Guide" and launch apps from the National Police Agency and the National Fire Agency. These two disaster prevention apps will provide the public with various disaster prevention guidelines for typhoons, earthquakes, natural disasters, and extreme conditions, as well as the locations of the nearest air raid shelters and disaster evacuation centers.

**Europe Also Preparing; Ministry of National Defense Warns There is No Longer "Peacetime" or "Wartime"**

National security officials noted that Germany plans to accelerate the expansion of blast shelters and air raid shelters starting July 2025. Poland's civil defense and population protection act, effective January 2025, mandates that buildings must include air raid shelters. Sweden announced in April 2025 an investment of 100 million Swedish Kronor to renovate 64,000 civil defense shelters nationwide, upgrading their air filtration systems to accommodate over two-thirds of Sweden's population, approximately 7 million people. Finland's Ministry of Interior stated in April 2025 that it would begin updating various air raid shelters to provide 72 hours of refuge for citizens. In May 2025, Estonia's Ministry of Interior also proposed strengthening air raid shelters, aiming to reinforce 270 public shelters nationwide for air defense.

These examples, according to national security officials, demonstrate that Taiwan is not alone in these preparations; countries worldwide are responding to extreme geopolitical risks. In addition to the air defense evacuation guide, officials added that in September 2025, Taiwan will also release a new national security guide for citizens, informally known as the "All-out Defense Handbook."

The Ministry of National Defense stated that the combination of this year's Hanguang Exercise with urban defense resilience drills is a response to the current reality that, since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war and the escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict, there is no longer a clear distinction between "peacetime" and "wartime," or between "front-line" and "rear-area" in warfare. The nature of war can be "immediate."

Defense officials explained that while it was initially thought the Russia-Ukraine war would last only three days, or at most a week, it has now exceeded three years, and Ukraine continues to fight. This experience shows that any country could face a protracted war involving homeland defense and urban combat. Urban warfare relies on the resilience of society to continue functioning. As long as Ukrainian citizens can continue their operations, the nation's combat strength will be sustained by public unity, preventing enemy invasion. This is the ultimate goal of this Hanguang Exercise: to foster an all-out national defense concept, regardless of peacetime or wartime.

**Taiwan Railways' First Price Increase in 30 Years! Fares Rise by 26.8%; Taipei to Zuoying Surges to NT$975**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E9%90%B530%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E6%BC%B2%E5%83%B9-%E7%A5%A8%E5%B9%B3%E5%B9%B2%E6%BC%B226-8-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%88%B0%E5%B7%A6%E7%87%9F%E9%A3%86975%E5%85%83-101334223.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Railways (TRA) is implementing its first comprehensive fare increase in 30 years, with an average hike of 26.8%. The express train (Tze-Chiang Limited Express) fare from Taipei to Xinzuoying will rise to NT$975, and from Taipei to Taitung, it will increase by NT$153. Local train (Fuxing/Juguang/Local Express) fares from Taipei to Banqiao will go from NT$15 to NT$22. Luggage and parcel fees will see an average increase of 36%. TRA is also revising its refund policy for delays; if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund without a handling fee within one year. Transportation scholars indicate that if the High-Speed Rail (HSR) follows suit, the only reason would be to manage passenger volume through pricing. While TPASS passes will not be directly affected, government subsidies will increase, adding to the financial burden.

**Taiwan is 'of course' a country, president says in rebuke to China**

<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is "of course" a country and China lacks both the historical evidence and legal proof to back up its sovereignty claims, President Lai Ching-te said on Sunday.

Lai made the remarks in a speech to graduating students at a university in northern Taiwan.

China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up military and political pressure against the island in recent years. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.

Lai said China was using the "one China principle" - a diplomatic acknowledgment of Beijing's position that there is only one China - to make its territorial claims.

"The so-called one China principle is a fabricated narrative," Lai said, adding that it was "used by China to unilaterally change the international order and create a new normal" around the world.

"Taiwan is, of course, a country. Taiwan and China are not subordinate to each other," he added, referring to the official position of his government.

Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's 23 million people can decide their future.

China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taiwan's previous government had maintained the official name of the island was the Republic of China, and that its sovereignty covered China, though that was not part of their practical policy.

Lai has previously said there is "no need" for Taiwan to declare independence as it is already an independent country.

Most countries, including the United States, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent country but oppose any attempt to change the status quo by force. They also have no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but maintain unofficial relations.`;
