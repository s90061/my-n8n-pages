            <h1>France Stops Flights to Madagascar Because of Possible Coup</h1>
            <p>France's national airline, Air France, announced today that it will stop all flights to Madagascar. This is because there might be a military takeover in the country. The flights are stopped from today until at least October 14th.</p>
            <p>Air France said in a statement that they are stopping all flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. This is due to the safety situation in Madagascar. They expect this stop to last until October 13, 2025.</p>
            <p>Today, the President's office in Madagascar said that there is an attempt to illegally take control of the government. But they did not give more details. Some soldiers joined protests yesterday that started in September. These protests are by young people, also called Generation Z.</p>
            <p>These protests were inspired by similar movements by young people in Kenya and Nepal. They began because there was not enough water and electricity. But they have grown bigger. Protesters in Madagascar want President Andry Rajoelina to step down. They also want him to say sorry for the violence used against protesters. They are asking to close the Senate and the election committee.</p>
            <p>The United Nations says that since September, at least 22 people have died and 100 people have been hurt in the protests. However, the Madagascar government has a different number for the deaths and injuries. President Rajoelina said this month that 12 people died.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Chip Company's Dutch Subsidiary Frozen by Netherlands; US Rules Add Pressure</h1>
            <p>China's semiconductor company, Wingtech Technology, announced today that the Dutch government has frozen its control over its Dutch subsidiary, Nexperia, for one year. Nexperia was already affected by new export rules from the US government.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology said tonight that the Dutch government froze Nexperia's global operations due to "unfounded national security reasons."</p>
            <p>Chinese financial media said that Nexperia is a main company for Wingtech Technology's semiconductor business. It is important for car semiconductors and special chips. It also "has strong partnerships" with big companies in new energy cars, power grids, communication, and data products around the world.</p>
            <p>The technology news website Bits&Chips reported on October 2nd that Nexperia was affected when the US government announced new export control rules at the end of September.</p>
            <p>The Dutch business newspaper NRC reported that after the new US rules started, American companies cannot give certain technology to Nexperia.</p>
            <p>Nexperia told the NRC newspaper then that it had already taken steps to keep its business running. It also said it would appeal the decision because the rules were "too broad and too strict."</p>
            <p>According to the changed US rules, if a company has at least 50% of its ownership held by a company on the US "entity list," it will face the same export limits. This is true even if the names of the two companies are different.</p>
            <p>The United States is making its trade blacklist wider. This change affects companies on the "entity list." Companies on this list cannot get US goods and technology without government permission.</p>
            <p>The "entity list" aims to stop companies and other groups that are seen as a threat to US national security or foreign policy. Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's main company, was added to this list by the US at the end of last year.</p>
