        const text = `Okay, here are three English news articles about transportation, at approximately a B2 level, focusing solely on the news content:

**Article 1: London's Congestion Charge Zone Expansion Considered**

London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, is considering expanding the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) and Congestion Charge Zone to cover a wider area of the city.  The current ULEZ charges drivers of older, more polluting vehicles a daily fee to enter the zone.  The Congestion Charge applies to vehicles driving in central London during peak hours.  Proponents of the expansion argue that it will improve air quality and encourage the use of public transport, cycling, and walking.  However, opponents are concerned about the financial impact on residents and businesses, particularly those who rely on vehicles for their livelihoods.  A public consultation is underway to gather feedback on the proposals before a final decision is made.  Transport for London (TfL) has stated that any revenue generated from the expanded zones will be reinvested in public transportation improvements. The debate highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing economic needs with environmental concerns in a major urban area.

**Article 2:  Electric Scooter Rentals Becoming More Common in European Cities**

The popularity of electric scooter rental services is rapidly growing across Europe.  Companies are deploying fleets of scooters in cities like Paris, Berlin, and Rome, offering residents and tourists a convenient and environmentally friendly alternative to cars and public transportation for short journeys.  While scooters provide a flexible and accessible mode of transport, they have also raised concerns about safety.  City officials are grappling with issues such as sidewalk clutter, reckless riding, and the need for designated parking areas.  Many cities are implementing regulations to address these concerns, including speed limits, mandatory helmet use, and designated riding zones.  Despite the challenges, the trend towards e-scooter rentals is expected to continue as cities seek to reduce traffic congestion and promote sustainable transportation options.  Furthermore, the integration of e-scooters with existing public transportation systems is being explored to create a more seamless and integrated urban mobility network.

**Article 3:  New High-Speed Rail Line Connects Major Northern Cities**

A new high-speed rail line has officially opened, connecting several major cities in the north of the country.  The project, which has been years in the planning and construction, promises to significantly reduce travel times and boost economic growth in the region.  The modern trains are equipped with comfortable seating, Wi-Fi, and other amenities, making travel more convenient for both business and leisure travelers.  The new line is expected to alleviate pressure on existing roadways and reduce carbon emissions by encouraging more people to choose rail over car or air travel.  The government has invested heavily in the project, highlighting its commitment to improving infrastructure and promoting sustainable transportation. Local businesses are optimistic about the potential benefits of the new rail line, anticipating increased tourism and easier access to markets in other cities.  Future phases of the project are planned to extend the line further, connecting even more communities and creating a comprehensive high-speed rail network.
