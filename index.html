            <h1>Federal Reserve Member Cook Ignores Trump's Firing Order, Says He Has No Right To Do It</h1>
            <p>Lisa Cook, a member of the US Federal Reserve Board, today did not follow former US President Donald Trump's action to remove her. She said that Trump does not have the legal power to interfere with an independent body like the Federal Reserve in this way.</p>
            <p>Trump had asked Cook to leave her job last week. Last night, he posted on his social media, "Truth Social," saying that he was firing her "right away." He mentioned claims that Cook had lied about her home loan agreements.</p>
            <p>Cook, through her lawyer Abbe Lowell, released a statement to the AFP news agency today. She said, "I will not leave my job. President Trump says he is firing me 'for good reason,' but the law does not say there is any good reason, and he does not have the power to do this."</p>
            <p>Lowell promised that they would "do everything needed to stop his (Trump's) illegal attempt."</p>
            <p>According to US federal law, Federal Reserve officials can only be removed if there is a "good reason." This means things like breaking the law or not doing their job well.</p>
            <p>Recently, the US Supreme Court, which has mostly conservative judges, said Trump could fire people from other independent government agencies. However, the court specifically did not include the Federal Reserve in that decision.</p>

            <h1>Chang Chao-yuan Hits Home Run, Gets MVP; Needs to Watch Glove Position More for Interference</h1>
            <p>Chang Chao-yuan, a catcher for the TSG Hawks, hit his eighth home run this season today. He got two hits and two RBIs, helping his team beat the Fubon Guardians 4-1. He was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP). He joked that to stop playing badly, he needed his teammate, pitcher Shih Tzu-chien, to give him a talk. About hitting a batter's bat with his glove (catcher's interference), he said he needs to be more careful about where his glove is.</p>
            <p>The Hawks played against the Guardians today. Chang Chao-yuan started as catcher and batted eighth. In the second inning, he hit a home run by himself. This put his team ahead. In the fifth inning, he got another hit that brought in a run. In total, he had two hits in four turns at bat and helped his team get two runs.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the second inning, when the Guardians were batting, their player Chen Kai-yu's bat hit Chang Chao-yuan's glove. This is called catcher's interference, and the batter got to go to first base. The Hawks' coach, Hung I-chung, went to talk about it. After the game, Hung said the umpire said it happened where the batter was swinging. But it felt like the batter did not really swing. It seemed the bat just dropped and hit the glove. But because the umpire made the call, they had to accept it.</p>
            <p>Chang Chao-yuan said that he felt his glove caught the ball first before it was hit by the bat. He said that to prevent this in the future, he needs to be more careful not to put his glove too far out.</p>
            <p>Chang Chao-yuan hit a home run after almost a month. He said he does not try to hit home runs often. He also joked that when he was not hitting well before, he talked to his older teammate, pitcher Shih Tzu-chien. After Shih talked to him, he hit a home run. So, when he was not playing well recently, he went to find Shih again and "asked him to talk to me."</p>
            <p>Chang Chao-yuan said that when he hit the home run in the second inning, he focused on the right timing. The pitcher threw a good pitch first, so he swung hard at a ball he could hit. He did not think too much. He was happy to hit a home run after a long time and to help his team a lot.</p>

            <h1>Pacific Island Students Train in Taiwan; Indigenous Youth Invited to Boost Diplomacy</h1>
            <p>Twenty-three students from different countries have come to Taiwan for the "Pacific Island Young Leaders Training Program." This year, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited three young people from Taiwan's indigenous groups to join the whole program in both America and Taiwan. This will bring new energy to Taiwan's friendships with countries that speak Austronesian languages. Ko Pao-hsuan, a high-ranking official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spoke at the start of the program. He said Taiwan can help make the area safe and will keep helping the Pacific island nations.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced today that it is working with the "East-West Center" (EWC), a group in Hawaii, USA, to hold the 10th "Pacific Island Young Leaders Training Program" (PILP) in 2025. The program began on August 25th at MOFA's school for diplomats. This year, the 23 students are from places like the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, Tuvalu, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Fiji, the Kingdom of Tonga, the Cook Islands, and French Polynesia.</p>
            <p>MOFA explained that this year, they also worked with the Council of Indigenous Peoples. They asked three young Taiwanese indigenous people to join the full program in Hawaii and Taiwan. This will make Taiwan's connections with Austronesian countries stronger in terms of diplomacy and culture. The program will teach about international relationships, safety in the region, protecting the environment, working together on health, and studying Austronesian cultures. The students will also stay one night in an indigenous village in Majia Township, Pingtung County.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that Ko Pao-hsuan, a high-ranking official, led the opening event. He was speaking for the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wu Chih-chung. Important guests also spoke, including Tuvalu's Ambassador to Taiwan, Lily Tangisia Faavae; the Deputy Head of Mission from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Cassailis Jarom; the Deputy Director of the American Institute in Taiwan, Karin Lang; and the head of the Pacific Islands Development Program at EWC, Mary Therese Perez Hattori. Other officials from the Australian office and Hawaii's office in Taipei also came to watch.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Ko Pao-hsuan said that the ways indigenous people in Taiwan and people in the Pacific islands make cloth, draw on their bodies, and eat food are very similar. This shows they have strong old connections. MOFA not only makes friendships stronger through many types of teamwork but also helps cultural exchange. Both Pacific island nations and Taiwan are facing problems like tensions in the area and changes in the weather. Taiwan can and wants to help keep the area safe. Taiwan is also ready to keep helping the Pacific island countries to build skills, keep the environment healthy, and have fair governments.</p>
            <p>Faavae said that countries in the Pacific are working together to face big dangers, like sea levels rising. They are also making their cooperation stronger in the current world politics. Jarom thanked Taiwan for helping the Pacific area grow. He said this teamwork is very important for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
            <p>Lang said that Taiwan is a world leader in good government, public health, and advanced technology like computer chips and AI. America is a Pacific country and always focuses its foreign policy on the Indo-Pacific area. It also continues to support trade, investing, and business. She said that the "Global Cooperation and Training Framework" (GCTF) has shown it wants to build strength and cooperation in the region. This includes help with natural disasters, public health, and computer security. She hopes that the friendships made by the students in Taiwan will make cooperation stronger between Pacific island nations, Taiwan, and America. This will help the region become rich and safe.</p>
            <p>Mary said that the most important thing in society today is not money, but the strong relationships that last a long time. The PILP, made by EWC and MOFA, is a key way to help build a network of leaders and strong connections in the area. It helps countries find and train young leaders who can do great things.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that the school for diplomats also asked students from the Indigenous Class at Shulin High School in New Taipei City to sing indigenous songs at the event. They sang and danced with the guests and made friends. This showed the idea that "everyone can be a diplomat."</p>
