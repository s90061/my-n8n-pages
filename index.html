US President Donald Trump announced that from August 1, he will put a 50% tax on products from Brazil. This is because of an investigation in Brazil about its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump said on Friday that he is ready to talk with Brazil's President Lula, but he said, "it should be at some point, not now."

Trump also praised Bolsonaro, saying he was "honest" and criticized Brazil's legal process. Bolsonaro lost the 2022 election to Lula. After Lula became president again, legal officials accused Bolsonaro of planning a coup to change the election results. Trump strongly criticized this, calling it a "witch hunt."

President Lula said Trump's words were a "serious" interference in Brazil's legal system. He stated that Bolsonaro and his son, Eduardo, are responsible for the trade problem between Brazil and the US. Lula said Brazil will respond calmly. They might use an "economic equality law," which could mean putting equal taxes on US goods, stopping trade agreements, and limiting patents. Brazil might also ask the World Trade Organization (WTO) for help.

**US Court Limits Los Angeles Police from Using Force on Reporters**

A US court has given a temporary order to stop police in Los Angeles from using rubber bullets, tear gas, and other non-deadly force on reporters. This happened after groups like the Los Angeles Press Club sued the city and police.

Last month, there were many protests in Los Angeles against federal officers raiding places for undocumented immigrants. During these protests, several reporters were hit by rubber bullets and forced away by the police. Because of this, journalist groups sued the police, saying they "repeatedly misused their power" against the media.

A judge issued the temporary order, which means Los Angeles police cannot use non-deadly force on reporters. Even in blocked areas, they cannot remove, stop, or arrest reporters who are doing their job. The judge said the journalist groups showed the court that this order was needed to protect reporters' rights to free speech.
