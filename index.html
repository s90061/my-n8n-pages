            <h1>White House: Trump to Attend US Open Men's Final</h1>
            <p>White House officials said that U.S. President Trump will go to the U.S. Open men's tennis final in New York on September 7th. This is the latest big sports event he will attend.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that officials, who did not want to be named, confirmed today that Trump will be at the U.S. Open final. Before this, Trump went to the NFL Super Bowl in February. He also went to the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.</p>
            <p>The players for the U.S. Open men's final will be known tonight. Novak Djokovic from Serbia will play against Carlos Alcaraz from Spain in the semifinals. Jannik Sinner from Italy will play against Felix Auger-Aliassime from Canada.</p>
            <p>This will be Trump's first time at Flushing Meadows since 2015. At that time, Trump was a candidate for president. When his wife, Melania Trump, arrived, the audience booed her.</p>
            <p>Bill Clinton, a Democrat, was the last president to attend the U.S. Open. He was also the first president ever to watch the U.S. Open. Clinton watched the women's singles final in 2000.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that he plans to go to the first day of the Ryder Cup golf tournament later this month.</p>

            <h1>Alcaraz Beats Djokovic in Three Sets, Reaches US Open Final</h1>
            <p>Carlos Alcaraz from Spain won against Novak Djokovic from Serbia today in three straight sets. This means Alcaraz has reached the U.S. Open final for the second time in his career.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Alcaraz won against Djokovic with scores of 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), and 6-2. This stopped Djokovic, who has won 24 Grand Slam titles, from winning another one.</p>
            <p>Alcaraz is trying to win his sixth Grand Slam title in his career. This would also be his second U.S. Open win after his first in 2022.</p>
            <p>In the final on September 7th, he will play against either the current champion Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime from Canada, who is the 25th seed in the tournament.</p>
