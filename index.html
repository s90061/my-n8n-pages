            <h1>Guardians Face Injuries: Shen Hao-wei Sprains Ankle, Chang Yi Has Hip Pain</h1>
            <p>The Fubon Guardians baseball team is having problems with many injured players. Yesterday, outfielder Shen Hao-wei hurt his ankle during a game. He stepped on some training equipment in an area outside the playing field while catching a ball. Pitcher Chang Yi also has pain inside his hip joint. Both players have been sent to the minor league to rest and get better.</p>
            <p>During the game yesterday, Shen Hao-wei made a great catch in the seventh inning. But when he landed, he stepped on equipment from the opposing team. He clearly felt pain and had to leave the game in the eighth inning. The Guardians lost the game 1-3 to the Rakuten Monkeys.</p>
            <p>Today, Coach Chen Chin-feng said that Shen Hao-wei will rest in the minor league for 10 days to see how he feels. Shen Hao-wei already had a leg injury, and now his other foot is also sprained. This is his third time in the minor league this season. Before yesterday's game, another player, Chang Chin-te, also went to the minor league because of tight back muscles. The Guardians are dealing with many injured players.</p>
            <p>The Guardians' relief pitcher, Chang Yi, also went to the minor league today. Coach Chen Chin-feng explained that the team's physical therapist reported today that Chang Yi has pain inside his hip joint. This pain is not related to how well he has been playing recently. As for who will be the team's main relief pitcher now that Chang Yi is gone, Coach Chen Chin-feng said they will decide based on the flow of each game. It might not always be the same person.</p>
            <p>This season, Chang Yi has played in 33 games in the major league, starting 7 of them. He has pitched 59 innings, won 4 games, lost 9 games, saved 8 games, and had 1 hold. His earned run average (ERA) is 5.34.</p>

            <h1>US Job Numbers Are Low, But Semiconductor Stocks Still Rise; Taiwan Market Looks to Exhibitions Before Fed Meeting</h1>
            <p>Even though the United States announced poor job growth numbers, causing most major US stock markets to fall, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which is closely linked to Taiwan's stock market, went up by 1.65%. Also, shares of TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) traded in the US increased by 3.49%. Experts believe that several upcoming events will help the Taiwan stock market grow. These events include the Taipei International Semiconductor Exhibition, the Taipei International Aerospace & Defense Industry Exhibition, and Apple's launch of new phones.</p>
            <p>Experts think that with good news coming from the semiconductor exhibition and other sources, Taiwan's stock market might even reach new high points before the US central bank (Fed) lowers interest rates in September. However, they also note that the Taiwan stock market is currently moving within a large range, with both good and bad news affecting it.</p>
            <p>The bad US job numbers made investors worried about the future of the economy. But because people now expect the Fed to lower interest rates sooner, US stock market losses were smaller by the end of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 220.43 points, or 0.48%, closing at 45400.86 points. The S&P 500 Index dropped by 20.58 points, or 0.32%, closing at 6481.50 points. The Nasdaq Index, which focuses on technology stocks, dropped by 7.30 points, or 0.03%, closing at 21700.39 points. However, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 93.541 points, or 1.65%, closing at 5761.398 points.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-guang, who is the chairman of Fubon Securities Investment Services, said in a phone interview that TSMC's shares traded in the US are priced more than 22% higher than its shares in Taiwan. This gives TSMC a lot of room to help the Taiwan stock market go up. Also, because people expect the Fed to lower interest rates in September, more money might flow into the market, pushing Taiwan stocks higher. With the good news from the semiconductor exhibition, the defense industry exhibition, and Apple's new product launch, Taiwan stocks could try to reach new record highs.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-guang explained that from April, when the US announced equal tariffs, the Taiwan stock market went from 17306 points to a record high of 24570 points in August, an increase of about 7200 points. If we count from the beginning of the year to the record high of 24570 points in August, it's an increase of over 6%. Even though investors are worried about risks if they buy stocks at high prices, speculative trading (buying and selling quickly to make money) is still strong. This keeps the Taiwan stock market growing steadily.</p>
            <p>He said that before the US Federal Reserve's meeting in September, the Taiwan stock market has good news from events like the semiconductor exhibition. Investors should watch if the market can go up with a lot of trading volume. However, they should also be careful if the price goes up but the trading volume does not. Still, the mood in the stock market right now is positive.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Environment: 17,000 Waste Solar Panels in Chiayi County Now Fully Removed by Company</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Doksuri caused a lot of damage to solar panels in central and southern Taiwan. A total of about 135,000 solar panels were damaged across 33 different sites in Taiwan. Among these, 17,000 damaged panels were piled up by a flood detention pond in Chiayi County. The time given to clear these panels ended yesterday. Today, the Ministry of Environment said that after checking with the environmental protection bureau, all panels have been removed.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment previously stated that after sorting the damaged panels, almost 50,000 panels have been sent to special facilities for recycling. Also, nearly 68,000 panels have been collected and temporarily stored in legal places. This means that 88% of the damaged solar panels have been properly stored and handled.</p>
            <p>However, 17,000 panels belonging to Yuan Yu Company were still piled up by the flood detention pond in Xinzhuang, Chiayi County. Because the company was slow to clear them, they were fined a total of NT$9 million. Later, Yuan Yu submitted a cleanup plan on August 22. The Chiayi County Environmental Protection Bureau approved this plan on August 28 and allowed the company to have more time until September 5 to finish the cleanup.</p>
            <p>The deadline for Yuan Yu Company's cleanup was yesterday. Yen Chen-ho, the director of the Southern Regional Environmental Management Center of the Ministry of Environment, told reporters today that he checked the site with the local environmental protection bureau. He confirmed that all 17,000 solar panels have been removed. They have been moved to legal storage sites or to proper recycling facilities.</p>
            <p>According to information from the Ministry of Environment, solar panels are mainly made of glass, aluminum frames, silicon wafers, EVA film, and plastic back sheets. Companies in Taiwan now have the technology to separate these materials well during the recycling process.</p>
            <p>For example, the glass is crushed and sorted to get clean glass, which is then sent to other companies to be made into new products. Clean silicon pieces are sent to special factories to get metals from them. Clean plastic back sheets can be recycled back into plastic or used to make ceramic materials and powder, which is then sold to tile factories to make tiles. More than 90% of the valuable materials can be taken out of the solar panels. This means they are recycled instead of being burned or buried in landfills.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment stated that Taiwan is actively working to recycle waste solar panels in ways that get valuable resources from them. There are currently 4 facilities that can process these materials, and they can handle up to 2,915 metric tons per month. More companies with recycling technology are expected to join in the future.</p>
