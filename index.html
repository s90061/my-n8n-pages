On July 11, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy confirmed that the United States has restarted its military help to Ukraine. He also said that the Ukrainian army will work with Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Ukraine. News from Ukraine says Kellogg will arrive in Kyiv next Monday, July 14, for a one-week visit. This visit happens on the same day US President Trump plans to make a "big announcement" about Russia.

President Zelenskyy said that reports show military aid deliveries have started again. He also mentioned that Ukraine has recently received good news from top officials in the US and European allied countries. He stressed that Ukraine is working closely with its partners to make more weapons and wants to make its air defense stronger first. It is also expected that more sanctions against Russia will be put in place.

On July 2, the US Department of Defense stopped some military aid to Ukraine to "make sure there are enough weapons at home." This caused concern. Many news sources reported that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the halt without telling the White House first. Meanwhile, Trump recently said that the US will give military aid to Ukraine through NATO and will make a "big statement" about Russia on July 14.

**Zheng Lijun Returns from US Tariff Talks, Only Smiles and Says Thank You**

Everyone is watching Taiwan's new tariffs with the United States. Zheng Lijun, the Deputy Premier of Taiwan, who led the talks, returned to Taiwan early this morning. When reporters asked her questions, she only smiled and said "thank you for your hard work" and "thank you." She did not answer any questions about the tariffs.

US President Trump recently announced new tariff rates for various countries. Japan and South Korea, which are seen as Taiwan's competitors, will have a 25% tariff. Vietnam and the Philippines will have a 20% tariff. These new tariffs are expected to start on August 1. Taiwan's original tariff was 32%, so the new rate is getting a lot of attention.

Zheng Lijun and her team arrived at Taoyuan International Airport by plane from the US at 5:30 AM today. When she saw the reporters, she waved and said "thank you for your hard work." She smiled and said "thank you" to all questions about the tariff talks, but she did not answer them.
