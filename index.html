            <h1>High School Baseball Team Leaves Tournament After Bullying; School Blamed for Handling It Badly</h1>
            <p>A famous high school baseball team in Hiroshima, Japan, called Koryo High School, quit the Summer Koshien tournament. This happened after they won their first game because of a bullying problem in their baseball club. This is the first time a team has ever left the tournament like this. However, the school said they received bomb threats and that students were being searched for online. They said they decided to leave to protect the students from more harm. But people are saying the school is blaming social media to hide that they did not handle the bullying problem well.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Koryo High School's principal, Hori Masakazu, held a press conference yesterday in Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture. He said that the violent acts in the baseball club were widely shared on social media. The students who did the bullying were found online, and their names and photos were put on the internet. Also, the school dorm received bomb threats, and students were insulted when they went to and from school. To keep "the students, teachers, staff, and local people safe," the school decided to leave the tournament. They also stopped coach Nakai Tetsuyuki from coaching for now.</p>
            <p>This is the first time in the spring and summer Koshien tournaments that a school has left after the tournament started because of a scandal.</p>
            <p>In January this year, there was violence in the Koryo High School baseball club. In March, the Japan High School Baseball Federation gave them a "serious warning." Before the Koshien tournament began, these events were already well-known online. But because the punishment was over, Koryo High School still decided to play. The Baseball Federation also thought it was "okay for them to play."</p>
            <p>The school said that in January this year, four second-year baseball players went to a first-year player's dorm room. They hit him in the chest and slapped him. The school said the four players have said sorry to the student who was hurt. This student moved to a different school at the end of March. The school first told the Hiroshima Prefecture High School Baseball Federation and gave them a report. The Japan High School Baseball Federation gave a serious warning in March, but they did not tell the public.</p>
            <p>Koryo High School won their first game against Asahikawa Shioh High School on the 7th. But at the same time, another violent event was shared online.</p>
            <p>Koryo High School said at the press conference that the second event was being looked into by a third-party group since June. However, bad things were still being said online about it. The school felt that "this would stop the tournament from working well and harm the good name and trust of high school baseball." So, they decided to leave the tournament.</p>
            <p>Koryo High School is a strong Koshien team. They have won the Spring Koshien tournament three times. Their win in the first game will not be taken away. But their second game against Tsuda Gakuen High School from Mie Prefecture will be counted as a loss for Koryo.</p>
            <p>The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Abe Toshiko, said about this event, "This is a very sad and not allowed action." About Koryo High School playing, she said, "This was a correct decision made by the Japan High School Baseball Federation, and I will not comment on it."</p>
            <p>This event surprised many people in Japan. Many people criticized the school for not handling the bullying problem well. They said that adults ignored what was truly right, just to get into Koshien.</p>
            <p>Sports writer Kobayashi Shinya said that strong baseball schools like Koryo High School want to get into Koshien and win. So, they often do not care enough for students who are hurt. The High School Baseball Federation said it was "not necessary to stop them from playing." But the Federation usually just accepts what the school says in its report. They rarely do their own study.</p>
            <p>Hiroshima City Council member Munagi Taichi wrote on social media platform X, "Koryo High School quitting really made 'it's all SNS's fault' a popular topic." He said, "Pushing the blame to SNS and making the school look like a victim has been seen through."</p>
            <p>He said he completely disagrees with the idea that the school "was forced to quit because of SNS." He said, "The real problem is that the school and the Japan High School Baseball Federation did not understand the violence enough. This made their first actions wrong and too slow."</p>

            <h1>Jellyfish Block Water Pumps at French Nuclear Plant, Causing It to Stop Working</h1>
            <p>The French power company, EDF, said that four reactors at the Gravelines nuclear power plant in northern France stopped working automatically. This happened because a lot of jellyfish blocked the pumps that cool the reactors. Because of this, the power plant had to stop working today.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that EDF said on its website that the nuclear reactors stopped by themselves because jellyfish unexpectedly appeared inside the filter drums of the cooling water pump station. However, "the safety of the plant, the people working there, and the nearby environment were not affected."</p>
            <p>EDF said that three of the reactors stopped automatically last night, and the other one stopped early this morning. The other two reactors at the power plant were already offline for repairs. This meant the whole power plant had to stop working completely.</p>
            <p>EDF said, "The plant team is now working. They are doing the necessary checks and actions to start the power units again, making sure everything is completely safe."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Dollar Slightly Weaker, Six Big Life Insurance Companies Make NT$18.3 Billion in July, Still 70% Less Than Last Year</h1>
            <p>In the second quarter, the New Taiwan dollar got 10% stronger against the US dollar. This caused big losses for life insurance companies. This made profits for the six largest life insurance companies go down in April and May. In June, the Taiwan dollar's ups and downs became much smaller because the central bank helped at the end of the month. In July, the Taiwan dollar got a little weaker, by 0.05%. The six big life insurance companies all made a profit in July. Together, they made NT$18.329 billion. But this profit was still 70% less than the same month last year.</p>
            <p>Among the six big life insurance companies, Taiwan Life and KGI Life announced on August 5th and 7th that they would use a new rule from the Financial Supervisory Commission. This rule changes how they set aside money for future payments. They added NT$15.128 billion and NT$23.402 billion, respectively, to their reserves for changes in foreign exchange rates. Including Nan Shan Life, Fubon Life, Cathay Life, and Shin Kong Life, who announced this earlier, all six big life insurance companies have now asked to release some of their reserves.</p>
            <p>Fubon Life made a profit of NT$5.93 billion after tax in July. For the first seven months of the year, their total profit after tax was NT$30.48 billion, which is 57% less than last year. Fubon Life said that in July, their main income came from dividends from stocks in Taiwan, interest, money made from selling stocks and funds in Taiwan and other countries, and money paid out from funds. For stocks, their Taiwan stock investments gave them dividends and profits when they sold them. The US dollar has become more stable recently, so they will change their plans to protect against currency changes as needed.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life made a profit of NT$4.25 billion after tax in July. Their total profit after tax for the year reached NT$23.04 billion, which is 64% less than last year. Cathay Financial Holdings explained that both Taiwan and US stock markets went up. Cathay Life's profits were helped by better dividend income and stock market gains compared to June, which added to their profit for the month.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life's reserve for foreign exchange changes went down from NT$56.4 billion at the end of June to NT$35.4 billion at the end of July. Cathay Financial Holdings said this happened for two main reasons. First, among the currencies they use to protect against risks, the Korean Won and Singapore Dollar lost more value than the New Taiwan dollar. Second, even though non-deliverable forwards (NDF) dropped from over 8% in June to almost 5% in July, the related profit or loss from this also went down. This meant more reserves were used. Overall, there is still enough room to deal with changes in foreign exchange rates.</p>
            <p>KGI Life made NT$3.818 billion in July, helped by dividend income and profits from selling stocks. Their total profit for the first seven months was NT$4.889 billion, which is 72% less than last year. KGI Life said they started using the Financial Supervisory Commission's new temporary rule for life insurance companies' reserves in July. All the reserves that were released will be used to make their foreign exchange change reserves stronger.</p>
            <p>Taishin Financial Holdings and Shin Kong Financial Holdings officially joined together on July 24 to become "Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings." Taishin Financial Holdings announced that Shin Kong Life made a profit of NT$1.8 billion in July. This was mainly because of dividend income and stable profits from investments. However, this profit was only for 8 days, from July 24 to 31.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Life made a profit of NT$1.742 billion after tax in July. Their total profit for the first seven months was NT$8.958 billion, which is 54% less than last year. Taiwan Life said this was mainly because the US dollar dropped sharply by 8.7% this year, leading to more losses from currency exchange. However, their insurance business continued to grow, and new contract premiums increased by 17% compared to the same time last year.</p>
            <p>Nan Shan Life had a profit of NT$790 million after tax in July. Their total profit for the first seven months was NT$15.18 billion, which is 56% less than last year. In July, Nan Shan Life's new combined contract premiums were NT$7 billion. Their main sales were investment-linked annuities, wealth management products, and high-protection products.</p>
