<br>
The band Mayday held their third "Back to That Day" 25th-anniversary concert at Taipei Dome tonight. A special guest was Energy, who just won a Golden Melody Award. They sang their new song "Ma Shang Qu" (meaning "Go Right Away"). They also invited Mayday member Martha to their concert, playing on the similar sound of "Ma Shang Qu" and "Martha Qu." Martha jokingly replied, "Don't force people like this, even if you just won a Golden Melody Award."
<br>
Energy members Milk, Ady, Toro, Kunda, and Shuwei all joined Mayday on stage. Energy thanked Mayday, saying that without Mayday's warm invitation, they wouldn't have had this amazing second chance. Ashin, Mayday's vocalist, teased Energy about needing a new member, saying it would increase his chances of winning a Golden Melody Award. Ashin also suggested a humorous new band name, "Energy Y."
<br>
Mayday's concerts are known for their playful banter with fans. While preparing to go back in time to their "Poetry of the Post-Youth" album, Ashin jokingly said that Mayday drummer Kuan-you never had a "youth," only a "mating season," making everyone laugh. Martha then stepped in to defend Kuan-you, but then joked that their next album would be called "Poetry of Menopause." Ashin added, "No, it's 'Poetry of Post-Menopause'!" The humorous exchange entertained the fans.

**Tatung Football Team Returns Strong, Hopes to Create a Professional Football League in Taiwan**
<br>
Taipei City Councilor Miao Po-ya of the Social Democratic Party announced today that the "Taiwan Leopard Cat Football Team," which changed its name in 2022, has been strengthened with new players and is now sponsored by Tatung Company. The team has returned as the "Tatung Football Team," hoping to help create a professional football league in Taiwan.
<br>
Miao Po-ya posted on Facebook that the "Tatung Football Team," started by Tatung Company in late 1963, is the oldest football team in Taiwan. It almost stopped existing at the end of 2021 due to changes in Tatung Company's plans.
<br>
After taking over and changing the name to "Taiwan Leopard Cat Football Team," Miao Po-ya said that after three years of hard work, the team has again received support from Tatung Company. Today, they held an event to rename the team and announce their future plans.
<br>
During the event, Miao Po-ya and Tatung Company's director, Chou Wei-liang, revealed a plaque, announcing the strong return of the "Tatung Football Team." Miao Po-ya said that in the three years since 2022, when she became the chairman of the "Taiwan Leopard Cat Football Team," she has worked to improve the team's performance. In the 2023 season, they achieved a good second-place finish in the Premier League.
<br>
Miao Po-ya stated that the team has developed four youth training teams: U10, U12, U15, and U18, all certified by FIFA. During this time, they have successfully encouraged various Taiwanese companies to invest over 30 million New Taiwan Dollars. The main Leopard Cat team has hired 119 coaches and players, providing over 100 jobs.
<br>
Regarding fans, Miao Po-ya said that in 2024, Leopard Cat home games set a new record for the Premier League with 677 people attending. In the same year, the average attendance at Leopard Cat home games was over 630, also the highest in the Premier League. They hope to quickly reach over a thousand spectators per game.
<br>
Looking ahead, Miao Po-ya said that it has been difficult to keep the team going, but she is happy to see the team return to Tatung Company's support. She hopes the team can dominate the Premier League. She also noted that more and more people in Taiwan enjoy playing football, and she hopes this will lead to a more developed football scene in the country, eventually creating a professional football league and reaching the World Cup.
<br>
Miao Po-ya's sister, Miao Guang-ya, who helps with the team's administration without pay, said that currently, the four youth training teams and the professional team have over 120 players.

**League of Social Democrats Disbands: Hong Kong's Pro-Democracy Parties Almost Gone in Five Years Due to National Security Law**
<br>
The League of Social Democrats (LSD), a key pro-democracy political party in Hong Kong for 19 years, announced its official disbandment today. Some people in Hong Kong believe this means that Hong Kong's pro-democracy parties have almost all disappeared since the "Hong Kong National Security Law" was put into effect on June 30, 2020.
<br>
On June 30, 2020, China's 13th National People's Congress Standing Committee passed the "Hong Kong National Security Law." On the same day, it was included in Annex III of the "Hong Kong Basic Law" as a national law and officially began in Hong Kong. Because of this, Hong Kong's pro-democracy parties have disbanded one after another in the past five years. According to an unofficial count in 2024, over 90 organizations in Hong Kong have dissolved because of this law, and not all of them were political groups.
<br>
On the very day the "Hong Kong National Security Law" started, June 30, 2020, important people from "Demosisto," a political party active in Hong Kong's 2019 "anti-extradition" movement, like Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Agnes Chow, announced they were leaving. Later that day, "Demosisto" announced it was dissolving immediately, stopping all its activities. It was the first political party to disband due to the "Hong Kong National Security Law."
<br>
On February 27, 2021, "Power for Democracy," another pro-democracy group that had been around for 19 years, also announced it would stop operating due to the strong pressure from the "Hong Kong National Security Law." On February 28 of the same year, Hong Kong police charged 47 people who took part in the 2020 Hong Kong Legislative Council election primary with "conspiracy to subvert state power." This became known as the "47-person case." Both events are seen as key moments in how the "Hong Kong National Security Law" was used against Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.
<br>
After this, 2021 became a time when many pro-democracy political parties and related groups in Hong Kong were disbanded. This included "Neo Democrats," which announced its disbandment on June 26 of that year; "Civil Human Rights Front," a key pro-democracy group, which announced its disbandment on August 13; "Civic Passion," which disbanded on September 3; and "Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China," another important pro-democracy group that had been around for 32 years, which announced its disbandment on September 25.
<br>
But the pressure on Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups did not stop there. For example, on May 27, 2023, the Civic Party, which had been around for 17 years and strongly pushed for direct elections for Hong Kong's leader, announced it would close down. After 10 months of closing down, it officially disbanded on March 27, 2024.
<br>
On February 13 of this year, the "Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute" (HKPORI), an independent polling organization that had regularly conducted surveys since 1991 (formerly "HKU POP"), also announced it would "indefinitely postpone all self-funded research activities," including its long-running regular polls and special studies. It plans to change its operations or stop entirely in the future and is looking for someone to take over.
<br>
One week later, on February 20, the Democratic Party, an old pro-democracy political party in Hong Kong founded in 1991, also announced its disbandment and set up a small group to handle the disbandment and closing process. On April 13 of the same year, the Democratic Party held a special meeting where they decided to let their central committee disband the party.
<br>
On the afternoon of June 29, the League of Social Democrats in Hong Kong held a press conference to officially announce its disbandment. Chairperson Chan Po-ying said that the LSD faced "strong political pressure" and made the decision considering its members and supporters. She said it was the only choice they could make and that she felt "ashamed" that the LSD had reached its end.
