Nvidia, a leading technology company, recently announced very strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The company's sales reached an impressive $26 billion, which is more than three times higher than the same period last year. A big reason for this success is the huge demand for its special chips, which are essential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) development.

Nvidia's profits also grew significantly, reaching nearly $15 billion. This growth shows how important AI technology has become in various industries. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, described the current situation as the start of "the next industrial revolution," where AI will play a central role.

Following these positive results, Nvidia's stock price increased, and the company announced plans to split its stock. This means that each share will be divided into ten new shares, making them more affordable for individual investors. They also increased their dividend, which is a payment to shareholders. These moves highlight Nvidia's strong position in the growing AI market.

**Companies Ask Workers to Return to Office, Facing Resistance**

Many companies are now asking their employees to come back to the office, at least for part of the week. This trend is growing, even though many workers still prefer working from home or having more flexible options. Companies often say that being in the office helps with teamwork, builds a stronger company culture, and can increase productivity.

However, employees have different opinions. For many, working from home offers a better balance between their work and personal life. They also save money and time by not commuting every day. Some workers feel that returning to the office without clear benefits adds stress and reduces their flexibility, which they have enjoyed since the pandemic.

This difference in opinion is causing tension. While some companies are firm about their return-to-office policies, others are trying to find a compromise, like a hybrid model where employees work some days in the office and some days at home. Finding the right balance that suits both companies and their staff remains a big challenge in today's world of work.

**Extreme Heat is Becoming the "New Normal," Warns UN**

The United Nations (UN) has recently warned that extreme heat events are no longer rare but are becoming the "new normal" around the world. This worrying trend is mainly caused by climate change, which is leading to higher global temperatures. Many regions, including large parts of Asia, Europe, and the Americas, have recently experienced record-breaking heatwaves.

These intense heat periods have serious consequences. They pose a significant risk to human health, leading to heatstroke and even deaths, especially among vulnerable groups. The high temperatures also severely affect agriculture, damaging crops and making it harder for farmers to produce food. Additionally, vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems can struggle under extreme heat.

Experts from the UN and other scientific organizations are urging governments and individuals to take urgent action. They emphasize the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop strategies to help people adapt to these hotter conditions. The goal is to limit the long-term impact of climate change and protect communities worldwide from its growing dangers.`;
