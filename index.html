A female truck driver, Ms. Xu, from a logistics company in Linkou, New Taipei City, was arrested yesterday. She is believed to have stabbed her male colleague to death after an argument about work. The police sent her to the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office.

The Linkou Police Department said they received a call around 8 AM yesterday. The caller reported that "someone stabbed someone with a knife." Police went to the logistics company on Hongchang Street. The injured man, Mr. Chen, was taken to the hospital but later died.

Police found that Ms. Xu, 36, and Mr. Chen, 41, both worked as truck drivers for the company. They argued about work, and Ms. Xu allegedly used a folding knife to stab Mr. Chen in his chest and neck. He lost a lot of blood and could not be saved. Police arrested Ms. Xu at the scene and took her for questioning. They also collected evidence. After questioning, she was sent to the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office for murder. Prosecutors believe she committed murder and asked the court to keep her in custody without contact with others. The New Taipei District Court said late last night that after talking to Ms. Xu, the judge decided to keep her in custody. They believe she committed a serious crime (which could mean more than 5 years in prison) and might try to run away or do it again. However, she is allowed to have visitors and send messages.

**Australian Journalist Cheng Lei Releases Book About Her Hard Three Years in Chinese Prison**

Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist who was held in China for three years, has written a book about her experience. She told Nikkei Asia that she was treated very badly for no reason while in prison. She hopes her book will show what unfair things the Chinese government did.

Cheng Lei used to work as a news anchor for China Global Television Network (CGTN). She reported on China's economy and interviewed important business people. In August 2020, Chinese authorities arrested her. They said she gave state secrets to other countries. She was released in October 2023 and went back to Australia. Now, Cheng Lei is sharing her story by appearing publicly and publishing her new book, "Cheng Lei: A Memoir of Freedom." The book talks about her very difficult time in Chinese prison.

Cheng Lei was held for a long time in a detention center in Beijing. She was prisoner number 21003. She told Nikkei Asia, "During that time, it felt like my mouth was always covered. There were many things I couldn't ask or say, and I had no pen to write with." For six months after her arrest in August 2020, Cheng Lei was kept in a small cell. This was part of a secret system used by China's Ministry of State Security. It holds people who are seen as a threat to national security. They can be held for up to six months without being charged, and they cannot see their family or a lawyer. Cheng Lei described the "needless cruel treatment" she faced. This included being forced to sit on the edge of her hard bed for 13 hours every day. This caused her lower back to become very painful and her hips to develop calluses. Also, two guards watched her all the time, even when she was showering, from only 40 centimeters away. She was questioned for many hours several times, as officials looked into messages she had sent. Cheng Lei believes this treatment was meant to be cruel. She said, "They want to break you, make you confess, drive you crazy and to the edge of suicide so they can get a confession you can't change." Cheng Lei admitted that she thought about ending her life when she felt hopeless. After one month in the secret detention system, she thought about hitting her head on the bathroom tiles. That was the only way she could think of to end her life in the cell. To cope with all this, Cheng Lei kept thinking about her friends and family, especially her two young children. She said, "I would use my imagination, like looking through my phone, to remember all the happy times in my life."

Cheng Lei was officially arrested in February 2021 for "illegally providing state secrets to foreign entities." Her trial was held in private in March 2022. After her time in the secret detention system ended, Cheng Lei was happy to be moved to another prison. She shared a bigger cell with three other female prisoners, which finally allowed her to have human contact. During her 32 months in this prison, she tried to make the difficult days a bit more fun. She once made a birthday cake for a fellow prisoner using steamed buns. She also used knocking on the wall to create a secret code to talk with a prisoner in the next cell. She also taught her cellmates about poems and English songs. Even though Cheng Lei had many reasons to be angry about what happened to her, she chose to focus on the human side. She even found herself feeling sorry for some of the prison guards. She said these guards sometimes showed "human kindness," like letting prisoners watch the World Cup or giving her shampoo when she asked for it. Cheng Lei said, "These guards were young, and they were not part of the system... I think all humans can feel a lot of kindness and understanding. The real evil is when a system tries to take away all human feelings from its people." Cheng Lei believes she was targeted by Chinese authorities because Beijing wanted to get back at the Australian government. In April 2020, Australia asked for an independent investigation into COVID-19, which started in China. Because she grew up in Australia and, as a journalist, had contact with foreign diplomats, Chinese national security officials watched her. Cheng Lei's book tells about the different people she met while in prison. She hopes her book will not only show the unfairness of China's national security system but also highlight the power of kindness, even in the hardest situations.
