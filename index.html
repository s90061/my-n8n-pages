Typhoon Daanas has passed. The Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center is now at Level 2. There are 6,544 reports of damage. Sadly, two people died and 635 were hurt. Most of the damage was in Tainan City and Chiayi County. More than 200,000 homes still have no electricity.

Farmers lost about 1.05 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Chiayi County lost the most money (48%), then Tainan City (26%), and Yunlin County (24%). Bananas were the most damaged crop.

Many tourists were stuck on islands like Penghu, Matsu, Xiaoliuqiu, Green Island, and Orchid Island. About 3,733 people moved to safer places in 11 cities and counties. Now, 119 people are staying in 18 shelters. The center will now work on helping Chiayi and Tainan recover and rebuild.

**US to Announce New Trade Rules Soon**

The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, said that the United States will make several big announcements about trade in the next two days. This is because a deadline for special taxes on goods ends on July 9th. He said that many countries have changed how they talk about trade, and many new ideas have come in.

President Trump had said that the US would start sending letters about these taxes on July 7th. Bessent explained that these letters are not a final warning. They just tell countries the tax rates on their products, unless they want to talk again and change them.

Trump also plans to talk with China this week about selling TikTok. Bessent did not say if this talk is part of the trade discussions. Bessent also said he will meet China's finance minister soon to talk about how the two countries can work together more, not just on trade.

**Philippines Welcomes Rohingya Refugees, Continues Helping People**

The Philippines has welcomed 8 more Rohingya refugees. These people are a Muslim group from Bangladesh and Myanmar. This shows that the Philippines continues its long history of helping people in need. Since 2019, the Philippines has helped about 30 Rohingya refugees in total.

The 8 new refugees arrived in Manila on July 3rd. One of them said he was very happy to have a new start. Many Rohingya people have been leaving Myanmar since 2017 because the military treated them badly. Many still try to escape to other countries in dangerous ways.

In 2019, the Philippines started a plan called "CPath" with the UN Refugee Agency. This plan helps Rohingya refugees come to the Philippines legally. It makes sure they are safe, have their basic rights, and can learn to live independently. The Philippines has helped many different groups of refugees since 1917, like Russians, Jews, and Vietnamese. In January this year, they also helped about 300 people from Afghanistan who were waiting to go to the US because they were afraid of the Taliban.
