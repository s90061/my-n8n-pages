The Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game will happen on July 15, which is July 16 in Taiwan. This year, the city of Atlanta will host the game for the third time. It's the first time the game is at the Braves' new stadium, which opened in 2017. The game will be between the American League and the National League All-Stars.

This year, the All-Star teams will wear their usual team uniforms instead of special All-Star jerseys. They will only have special hats with the All-Star logo. MLB said they are doing this because fans asked for it. The Braves last hosted the All-Star Game in 2000, so this is their first time in 25 years. They will honor important people from their team's history before the game.

Three former Braves players, Chipper Jones, Andruw Jones, and Andres Galarraga, will throw the first pitch. These players were All-Stars when Atlanta hosted the game in 2000. Chipper Jones was a great third baseman who played in 8 All-Star Games and won the World Series in 1995. Andruw Jones was a great outfielder who played in 5 All-Star Games and won 10 Gold Glove awards. Andres Galarraga played in 5 All-Star Games and won 2 Gold Glove awards. He was also known for fighting cancer. The MLB will also remember Hank Aaron, a famous Braves player, during the game.

**Trump Sends Letters About New Tariffs, Loves Writing Letters**

This week, former U.S. President Donald Trump sent letters to many country leaders. The letters told them about new taxes on goods that will start on August 1. At the same time, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, gave Trump a letter. This letter said that Trump should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. News reports say that Trump really likes to communicate using formal letters with his signature. He has liked doing this for many years.

The Washington Post said that if you want to reach Trump, sending a letter with his signature is a good way. This shows how he thinks about talking to people and what a president should do. He likes things he can touch and he likes to get attention. Other U.S. presidents had different ways of talking to people. For example, President Biden likes to call people on the phone. President Obama read 10 letters from the public every night. George H. W. Bush often wrote short notes by hand.

Even though Trump often appeared on TV and talked to reporters during his time as president, he prefers to use written letters for official talks, especially with world leaders. A White House official said that Trump likes the special feeling and tradition of letters. In today's digital world, letters are not common, and he likes it when someone takes the time to do something "old-fashioned" like writing a letter. Trump has kept many letters from famous people and politicians over the years. He even showed a letter from King Charles III and said the King's signature was "beautiful." He also liked the note that President Biden left for him on his first day in office.

**Heavy Rain Possible in Central and Southern Taiwan This Morning, Rain to Decrease at Night**

The weather office says that today, July 11, Taiwan is still affected by a low-pressure system. This means that there are southwest winds, and the western part of Taiwan will have temporary rain or thunderstorms. This morning, rain started in the south and moved to central Taiwan, as well as Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. There is a chance of heavy rain in some local areas.

Later in the afternoon, Yilan and Hualien will also have thunderstorms. The weather office expects the rain to slowly stop during the night. They warn that the soil in the mountains is very wet from recent rain. If you go to the mountains, be careful of landslides and falling rocks. The temperature will be about 30 to 31 degrees Celsius during the day and 23 to 26 degrees Celsius at night.

For the islands, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will also have rain and thunderstorms with temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius. Because of the low-pressure system, areas south of Changhua, Taitung, and Penghu may have strong winds. The waves near the coast will be high, around 2 meters. People doing activities near the sea and ships should be careful. Also, it is a high tide period, so low areas along the coast in central and southern Taiwan might have flooding. The air quality is mostly good in many areas, but it is "normal" in the northern part of Taiwan.
