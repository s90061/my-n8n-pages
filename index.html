            <h1>Weekend Warning: High Temperatures Expected, Increased Rain in Southern Taiwan from August 17th</h1>
            <p>The Weather Bureau has announced that there will be very high temperatures for the next two days, Saturday and Sunday. In the western part of Taiwan, temperatures will mostly be 34 to 35 degrees Celsius. In Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Tainan areas, temperatures might even reach 37 degrees Celsius. On Saturday, people in Chiayi and areas further south should prepare for possible heavy rain in the afternoon. From August 17th to 19th, there will be more moisture in the air. This means there might be local heavy rain in the western parts of Taiwan and in mountain areas in the afternoon. The southern parts of Taiwan might even have very heavy rain.</p>
            <p>A weather forecaster from the Central Weather Bureau said that on Saturday, the weather will be sunny to partly cloudy. There will be small, short showers in Keelungâ€™s northern coast and on the Hengchun Peninsula. In the afternoon, there will be local thunderstorms in Nantou, Yunlin, and areas further south, as well as in flat areas near mountains north of central Taiwan and in mountain areas in eastern Taiwan. Among these, Chiayi and areas further south might have local heavy rain.</p>
            <p>The forecaster also mentioned that from August 17th to 19th, clouds from the south will move north, bringing more moisture to all areas. Taitung and Pingtung will have short showers or thunderstorms. In the western parts of Taiwan and in all mountain areas, there will be local heavy rain in the afternoon. The southern areas might experience very heavy rain. From early morning to noon, there will be small, short showers in western Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that from August 20th to 22nd, there will be less moisture, and the weather will become partly cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, there will be local short thunderstorms in the western parts of Taiwan and in the mountain areas of eastern Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The forecaster said that temperatures will be especially high on Saturday and Sunday. In eastern Taiwan, it will be about 31 to 33 degrees Celsius. In western Taiwan, it will be 34 to 35 degrees Celsius. Northern Taiwan and areas near mountains in the south might reach 36 degrees Celsius. On Saturday, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Tainan might reach around 37 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that in the coming week, there might be a tropical disturbance in the South China Sea and in the waters southeast of Taiwan (east of the Philippines). The conditions in the waters southeast of Taiwan are not very good, so it might just be a low-pressure system moving north, bringing some moisture to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>However, the disturbance in the South China Sea has a chance to develop. The forecaster said that current predictions from different countries show it moving towards the Indochina Peninsula, so it will not directly affect Taiwan. But regarding its strength, European and American predictions are different. European models predict it will be weaker, while American models predict it might become a typhoon. AI models, however, think it will only be a tropical depression. More observation is needed.</p>
            <p>The forecaster reminded everyone that on Saturday, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Pingtung, and Taitung might experience strong gusts of wind up to level 8. Taipei city area will also have stronger gusts of wind.</p>

            <h1>Presidential Office Denies Legislator's Claim About Reviewing Recall Election Failure, Calls it "Fake News"</h1>
            <p>A legislator said that the Presidential Office sent a letter to the Executive Yuan to review why the recall election on July 26th failed. The spokesperson for the Presidential Office, Kuo Ya-hui, said today that this is "fake news" and "openly making up stories." She explained that the letter is a regular monthly report from the Presidential Office's Public Affairs Office. It collects information about what the public is concerned about. All the information in the report shows issues that people care about. It is not, as the rumor says, "instructions from the Presidential Office to the Executive Yuan about tasks to do."</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei, a legislator from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, claimed that "the Presidential Office sent a letter to the Executive Yuan asking to review the failure of the July 26th recall" and said that the document was "the first official admission that the big recall failed." Ms. Kuo Ya-hui said this afternoon that this claim is "fake news" and "completely untrue." She explained that the document Wang Hung-wei talked about is a "monthly summary of public complaints" from the Presidential Office's Public Affairs Office. It lists many important issues and opinions that people have shared. This information is then sent to the Executive Yuan every month for their reference. The claim that "the Presidential Office sent a letter to the Executive Yuan asking to review" is completely false.</p>
            <p>Ms. Kuo said that it is regrettable that Wang Hung-wei, perhaps for a special reason, only took one part of the second item from the list of public concerns. She said that Wang used this small piece of information to falsely accuse the Presidential Office of telling the Executive Yuan to review the recall movement. However, the main title of the letter clearly states "Important Issues of Public Concern in July of this year." The letter lists 8 items in detail, all of which are clearly listed as issues that the public complained about.</p>
            <p>She asked political figures not to say things that are not true, to avoid taking things out of context, and to not mislead the public.</p>

            <h1>The Economist: Western Countries Have Many Ways to Get Around China's Control of Rare Earths</h1>
            <p>The Economist magazine recently wrote an article saying that China seems to be using rare earth minerals to put economic pressure on other countries. However, Western countries are working hard to become less dependent on China. They are doing this by producing their own rare earths, recycling magnets, and making motors that don't need any rare earths at all. The more China tries to use its power in the market, the more other countries will try to find ways to work without China.</p>
            <p>The article mentioned that China seems to be using rare earth minerals to put economic pressure on other countries. Unlike other important goods that China produces a lot of, like copper and lithium, rare earth production does not depend on importing raw materials. Also, it costs very little for China to limit rare earth exports, but it can stop entire industries in other countries.</p>
            <p>Since early April this year, China has limited rare earth exports. Because of this, some car factories in other countries had to stop production. Western companies and officials quickly started talking with China. Some companies agreed to give China private business information, like technical drawings, to get permission to export.</p>
            <p>In June this year, especially for magnets, the approval process for export permits started to become faster. However, the amount exported was still low and changed a lot. German companies received more magnet export permits than American companies. Car manufacturers in India, which has tense relations with China, seemed to be at the back of the line for applications.</p>
            <p>Even if China's rare earth exports return to normal levels, it might take several months to fill up existing supplies. Also, some permits are only good for six months. After that, buyers have to apply again, and the rules could change again.</p>
            <p>However, the article pointed out that because Western leaders see China's actions as a serious threat, they have started to try to become less dependent on China.</p>
            <p>Experts from the "Center for Strategic and International Studies" (CSIS), a think tank in Washington, said that the United States is making "a whole-government effort" to reduce its reliance on China's rare earths. For example, the Mountain Pass mine in California started operating again in 2018. Last year, it produced 47,000 tons of light rare earth oxides. The goal is to increase production to 60,000 tons by 2030. The U.S. Department of Defense has promised to guarantee a minimum price for its output, which is higher than the price before China limited exports.</p>
            <p>Also, the Australian company Lynas Rare Earths, with help from the U.S. and Japanese governments, started producing heavy rare earths in Malaysia in May. This makes it the first commercial producer outside of China. The European Union has also said it will support rare earth projects in Malawi and South Africa in Africa. Hundreds of other projects are being planned around the world.</p>
            <p>However, most of these projects will not start for several years. Also, China produces rare earths very efficiently, making it hard to compete with them. It is also difficult to guess how long China's rare earth limits will continue, which makes it hard for foreign mines to get large upfront investments.</p>
            <p>The article also mentioned that another way to deal with China's rare earth export limits is recycling. Currently, this is done on a very small scale. The founder of Caremag, a new rare earth company, said that recycling magnets is "the richest ore we know of."</p>
            <p>The European Union, which does not have rare earth mines, especially wants to develop a recycling industry. Last year, they passed a law to get one-fourth of the EU's needs for important minerals, including rare earths, from recycling by 2030. A Canadian company called Cyclic Materials is also building two factories that can produce 500 tons of recycled rare earths per year, including heavy rare earths.</p>
            <p>The article also said that some companies, like electric car makers, might be able to use less rare earth. A German car parts supplier has made a motor that does not need any rare earths at all and plans to produce it in large amounts by 2028.</p>
            <p>Finally, the article stated that Western countries do not need to create local products that completely replace China's rare earth industry. Doing so would be very expensive and would require endless financial support.</p>
            <p>An expert said that if reliance on China is reduced to 60% to 70% of consumption, the risk can be greatly lowered. The more China tries to use its power in the market, the more other parts of the world will try to work around it. The only way China can keep its control for a long time is by keeping rare earths cheap and easy to get.</p>
