        const text = `**The Rise of AI: How Technology is Changing Work**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the way many businesses operate and how people work. This technology is no longer just for science fiction; it is now a part of our daily lives, from customer service chatbots to systems that analyze large amounts of data. Businesses are using AI to make tasks faster, more efficient, and to improve decision-making.

For example, AI can automate repetitive jobs, like data entry or scheduling appointments. This means human workers can focus on more creative or complex tasks that require unique human skills, such as problem-solving or building relationships. Companies are reporting increased productivity and better service quality because of AI. However, this change also brings concerns about job security. Some jobs may disappear, but new ones are also being created that require people to work alongside AI, using new skills like AI management or data interpretation. Experts believe that continuous learning and adapting to new technologies will be key for workers in the future.

**Cities Face New Challenges from a Changing Climate**

Across the world, cities are experiencing more extreme weather events, which are making daily life more difficult and putting pressure on city infrastructure. Longer and hotter heatwaves, heavier rain leading to floods, and stronger storms are becoming more common. These changes are a result of global climate change, and they present serious challenges for urban areas.

For residents, extreme heat can be dangerous for health, especially for older people or those with existing medical conditions. It also increases the demand for electricity for air conditioning, sometimes causing power outages. Heavy rains can flood streets, homes, and businesses, causing significant damage and disrupting transport. In response, city planners are looking for new solutions. These include creating more green spaces and parks to help cool down urban areas, improving drainage systems to handle more water, and building structures that can withstand extreme weather. These efforts are crucial to make cities safer and more livable in the face of a changing climate.

**The Blending of Work and Travel: Digital Nomads on the Rise**

The way people work has changed a lot since the pandemic, with more companies allowing employees to work from anywhere. This has led to a growing trend where people combine their work with travel, often called "digital nomadism." Instead of staying in one place, these individuals travel to different countries or cities while continuing their jobs remotely.

This lifestyle offers a lot of freedom and the chance to experience diverse cultures and places. People can work from a cafÃ© in Paris, a co-working space in Bali, or a beach house in Mexico. It allows for a better work-life balance for some, as they can explore new environments during their free time. However, it also comes with challenges, such as finding reliable internet, dealing with different time zones, and sometimes feeling isolated. Many countries are now creating special visas for digital nomads, recognizing the economic benefits they bring. This trend is reshaping both the future of work and the tourism industry.`;
