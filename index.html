            <h1>European Stocks Mostly Up Despite New Tariffs from Trump</h1>
            <p>(London, August 7, Central News Agency) European stock markets mostly went up today. This happened even though new tariffs from US President Trump started for many countries. The markets also felt better because the Kremlin announced that Trump and Russian President Putin will meet soon. This news might make political tensions less strong.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went down by 63.54 points, or 0.69%, closing at 9100.77 points.</p>

            <h1>Pacific Islands Forum Does Not Invite US, China, Taiwan; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Calls for Keeping Old Ways</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, August 7, Central News Agency) The Pacific Islands Forum will happen in September. China asked for Taiwan to be left out. So, the Solomon Islands, which is hosting, decided to invite only member countries. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that the final plan is still to be announced by the host country. They asked to keep the old ways, saying that Taiwan's involvement helps bring peace and wealth to the Pacific area.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) will be held in the Solomon Islands in September. After Beijing pushed to leave Taiwan out, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Jeremiah Manele, said on August 6 that 21 helper countries, including the United States and China, and also Taiwan, will not be invited to the meeting.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to a question from Central News Agency. They said that they know the 54th PIF summit, from September 8 to 12, will only have member countries. This is because the host, the Solomon Islands, thinks the PIF's new system for partners is not ready. So, for now, they don't plan to invite all "Dialogue Partners" and "Development Partners." The host country will announce the exact plan later.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Taiwan has been a "Development Partner" in all PIF activities since 1993. Taiwan also joins the "Taiwan/Republic of China-Forum Countries Dialogue," which is set up by the PIF office during the summit. In this meeting, Taiwan talks with member countries.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked to keep the old ways. They said that Taiwan always works in the Pacific with a spirit of diversity and acceptance, like all PIF member countries, following "The Pacific Way." They believe Taiwan's involvement can continue to grow cooperation with PIF, friendly Pacific countries, and countries that think alike. This helps bring peace, stability, and growth to the Pacific area.</p>

            <h1>Sun Chia-hung is Taiwan's Flag Bearer at World Games, Says It Feels "Like a Dream"</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, August 7, Central News Agency) The opening ceremony for the 2025 Chengdu World Games happened today. Sun Chia-hung became the first Wushu athlete to be the flag bearer for the Taiwan team. He was very excited and said this moment felt like something from a dream.</p>
            <p>At the last World Games in Birmingham, Taiwan's team won 1 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze medals. For the Chengdu World Games this year, Taiwan sent 120 athletes for 14 types of sports. The women's tug-of-war team will try to win their 6th straight gold medal in the 500 kg category, which has never happened before.</p>
            <p>At the opening ceremony of the Chengdu World Games today, Sun Chia-hung and Huang Mei-chien were the flag bearers for Taiwan's team. They came out 104th, between Syria and the Czech Republic. In total, 64 athletes joined the event, including those for canoe polo, korfball, orienteering, underwater sports, roller sports, water skiing, Wushu, and tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-hung won a gold medal in Tai Chi Fist and a silver medal in Tai Chi Sword at the 2021 Chengdu World University Games. Now, he is back in Chengdu and is the first Wushu athlete to be a flag bearer. He told reporters he was very moved, saying this sight was something he had only seen in dreams since he was a child. He felt it was a result of hard work over time, and that many older athletes before him did very well. Together, they made Taiwan's Wushu known and respected in international sports.</p>
            <p>Huang Mei-chien was a swimmer for Taiwan at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In recent years, she has focused more on coaching. But she still competes in fin swimming. In 2024, she won a gold medal in the 50-meter bi-fin race at the World Fin Swimming Championships. Huang Mei-chien shared that she has been an athlete's oath representative and a torch bearer before. But being a flag bearer is new for her. She said she is "very excited but also a little nervous, and hopes to do this job well."</p>
