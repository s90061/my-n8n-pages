            <h1>Removing Gongguan Roundabout: Banners Hung Saying "Construction Miracle," Taipei City Says It Will Try to Finish Fast</h1>
            <p>The project to remove the Gongguan Roundabout and fill in the underpass in Taipei has started. But people still have different ideas about it. Someone put up a sign on a bridge near Shiyuan Market. It said, "Wan-an did it! A construction miracle! Taking it down is even smoother than not taking it down." Traffic Commissioner Hsieh Ming-hung said they are working hard to make the construction period shorter to cause fewer problems.</p>
            <p>The work to remove the Gongguan Roundabout and fill in the underpass started on September 13th. This week, starting September 22nd, is the second weekday week of the project. People in the community still have different thoughts about this work. Some think the city should first try out different road signs. Then, a message appeared online with the sign saying, "Wan-an did it! A construction miracle! Taking it down is even smoother than not taking it down."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsieh Ming-hung spoke on the phone and said he could not guess why the sign was put up. He said the Traffic Department is now working very hard to shorten the construction time. This is because filling in the underpass means there will be two fewer lanes, which will affect traffic.</p>
            <p>He also said that they have plans to help with traffic. These plans include working with New Taipei City to watch all the cars, changing the time for traffic lights, and asking traffic police to keep intersections clear. They are trying their best to keep cars moving smoothly on Keelung Road (east-west) and Roosevelt Road (north-south).</p>
            <p>Ms. Huang Hui-ju, who is the Deputy Director of the Traffic Engineering Department, said that the city government did not say the words on the sign. She said that during the construction, they will try their best to keep traffic normal. She also said they did not promise that traffic would be better than before the work started. The main reason they decided to do the work is to make fewer accidents happen.</p>
            <p>Regarding the sign being hung up, she said they would tell the New Construction Office. If it is an illegal advertisement, they will take it down.</p>
            <p>Also, today, Typhoon Kashasa caused some problems. She said that when it rains, driving is usually affected, and traffic gets heavier. The Traffic Control Center of the Traffic Engineering Department said that from 7:30 to 8:00 AM today, traffic going north on Roosevelt Road into Taipei was heavy. They will make the traffic lights stay green longer to help, and police will also help guide cars at intersections. Also, traffic on Yongfu Bridge and Fuhe Bridge was slow, but it was not very bad compared to usual.</p>

            <h1>Trump Signs Order to Call Anti-Fascist Movement a Domestic Terrorist Group</h1>
            <p>The White House said that after a conservative internet personality named Charlie Kirk was killed, President Trump signed an order today. This order says that a left-wing group called "Antifa" is a terrorist group in the country.</p>
            <p>News agencies reported that President Trump's order states that Antifa is a "domestic terrorist organization." This is because of their "political violence that tries to stop lawful political activities and block the rule of law."</p>
            <p>Here is some information about the Anti-Fascist movement and why it is hard for the Trump government to stop them as they threaten.</p>
            <h2>Why is Trump doing this now?</h2>
            <p>Earlier this month, conservative internet personality Charlie Kirk was killed. After this, Trump promised to take action against the left-wing groups he said caused violence.</p>
            <p>There is no public proof that Antifa was involved in Kirk's death. Officials said they do not know the reason why Kirk was shot. The shooter, Tyler Robinson, has also refused to work with the police.</p>
            <p>However, Trump still called Antifa a "sick, dangerous, radical left-wing disaster." He also promised to find out where their money comes from.</p>
            <h2>What kind of group is the Anti-Fascist movement?</h2>
            <p>The Anti-Fascist movement is not a regular political group with a clear structure. A report from 2020 by the U.S. Congressional Research Service said that Antifa is a movement without a central leader or clear organization.</p>
            <p>Some experts who study extreme politics, and also Christopher Wray, the former head of the FBI, believe that Antifa is more like a way of thinking. It's about being against fascism and white supremacy, not a single organized group. Because of this, they are protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects free speech.</p>
            <h2>Where did the Anti-Fascist movement start?</h2>
            <p>The Anti-Fascist movement started from groups in Europe in the early 1900s that were against fascism. In the United States, it became more known after Donald Trump became president in 2016.</p>
            <h2>How is the Anti-Fascist movement organized?</h2>
            <p>The Anti-Fascist movement is made up of many small groups in different places. These groups work separately, but they might share plans, ideas, and help each other by talking in person or using special encrypted messaging apps.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters and a 2020 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), people in this movement form "affinity groups." These are small unofficial groups of 3 to 8 people. Members in these groups trust each other and protect each other during protests.</p>
            <h2>How does the Anti-Fascist movement work?</h2>
            <p>People who support the Anti-Fascist movement believe in "direct action." This can be street protests, or sometimes it can become more violent, like burning police cars or breaking windows. The CSIS report says that people taking part often wear black clothes and cover their faces.</p>
            <p>Online, they might follow right-wing groups or try to find and share information about people they think are extreme right-wing.</p>
            <h2>Has the Anti-Fascist movement been involved in violence?</h2>
            <p>U.S. law enforcement agencies say that there have never been terrorist attacks in the United States linked to the Anti-Fascist movement. Trump first suggested calling Antifa a terrorist group in 2020, during the protests after George Floyd died.</p>
            <p>In August 2020, a well-known event linked to the Anti-Fascist movement happened in Portland, Oregon. A man named Michael Reinoehl, who said he supported Antifa, shot and killed Aaron ‚ÄúJay‚Äù Danielson. Danielson was a member of a far-right group called "Patriot Prayer." Later, federal and local police officers shot and killed Reinoehl when they tried to arrest him.</p>
            <p>Recently, in San Diego, a jury found two men guilty of planning a riot. This happened after a street protest in 2021. The lawyers said these two men were members of the Anti-Fascist movement.</p>

            <h1>Trump: Don't Rush Hepatitis B Vaccine; Painkillers May Be Linked to Autism Risk in Children</h1>
            <p>President Trump said today that there is "no good reason" to give newborns the Hepatitis B vaccine. He also warned pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol, which is a common painkiller. He said its main ingredient might be connected to a risk of autism in children.</p>
            <p>News agencies reported that Trump today asked for big changes to the normal vaccination schedule for babies. Without showing any proof, he strongly said that there is "no good reason" for newborns to get the Hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B is a disease that cannot be fully cured and spreads very easily.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I would suggest waiting until the child is 12 years old, when their body has fully grown, before giving the shot." This idea is against what most doctors agree on. Doctors say the best way to stop Hepatitis B from spreading from a mother to her baby is to give the vaccine to the newborn within 24 hours after birth. This helps to prevent future liver damage and liver cancer.</p>
            <p>The Trump government also released some very debated ideas today about what causes autism. They also plan to support research to find a possible "cure."</p>
            <p>Trump claimed that pregnant women should not take Tylenol, which is an over-the-counter painkiller. He said its main ingredient, acetaminophen, might be linked to a risk of autism in children. Scientists around the world strongly disagree with this idea, and it is different from what studies have found.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke at the White House next to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He said, "Not everything is 100% understood or known, but I think we have made a lot of progress."</p>
            <p>He clearly stated, "Taking Tylenol is not good... All pregnant women should talk to their doctor about using this medicine less during pregnancy." He later said again, "Don't take Tylenol. There is no harm in not doing so."</p>
            <p>Also, the government will study if leucovorin can be used to treat autism. Leucovorin is currently used to treat cancer and anemia.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in 2022, 1 out of every 31 eight-year-old children in the U.S. was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This disorder includes problems with social talking and interacting, and also repeating behaviors. In the year 2000, it was 1 out of every 150 children in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that the increase in people with autism is due to "things in the environment that are harmful." He called autism "a complex disease with many causes." He has also often said that more people have autism because of vaccines.</p>
            <p>However, experts believe that the increase in autism numbers is mainly because more people are being tested, and how doctors diagnose autism has changed. They also say that family genes play a very important part in what causes autism.</p>
