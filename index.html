**US Senate Barely Passes Big Bill; Vance's Vote Breaks Tie**

The US Senate, led by Republicans, voted today on President Trump's "big and good bill." The vote was tied at 50-50. Vice President JD Vance then cast the deciding vote, allowing the bill to pass.

This vote happened after a very long 24-hour voting session. Democratic senators tried to change many parts of the bill. It was hard for Republican leaders in the Senate to get enough support.

The bill will now go to the House of Representatives. Democrats are likely to vote against it. Some Republicans also have concerns because the bill cuts money for healthcare and food aid for poor Americans. The "big and good bill" will continue Trump's tax cuts, which will cost $4.5 trillion. To pay for this, $1.2 trillion will be cut from other areas, like the Medicaid health plan. This could affect 12 million low-income and disabled people in the US.

**NBA Bucks Release Guard Lillard, Sign Pacers Center Turner for $3.1 Billion**

The Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA have let go of their star guard Damian Lillard. This was done to create space to sign Myles Turner, a center from the Indiana Pacers, for a 4-year, $107 million (about NT$3.134 billion) contract.

The Bucks will spread out the remaining $113 million of Lillard's contract payments over the next five seasons. Lillard was injured during the first round of the playoffs this year when he tried to get a rebound. He was found to have a torn Achilles tendon in his left foot and might miss the entire 2025-26 season. The Bucks decided to release him directly to sign Turner.

Turner has agreed to a 4-year, $107 million contract with the Bucks. This deal also includes an option for the player in the fourth year (2028-29 season) and a 15% trade bonus. Turner played for the Pacers for 10 years, making him the longest-serving player on their team. He had previously said he wanted to stay with the team. After the Pacers lost in the NBA Finals, Turner's agents pushed for a new contract. However, because their key player Tyrese Haliburton was injured, the Pacers became more set on saving money and managing their salaries. This helped the Bucks get the new center.
