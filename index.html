        const text = `**"Too Much Pain from Teeth Cleaning" â€“ Female Dentist Beaten. Gang Member Xia An and One Other Detained.**

A 21-year-old man, Zhou Zijun, went to a dental clinic in Taipei last month. He claimed his "teeth cleaning hurt too much" and severely beat the female dentist, Dr. Shen. Police found that the owner of "Global Village," Chen Zhongyi, asked Xia Weiteng, a main figure from the Zhulian Gang's Jingan Branch, to handle a debt of tens of millions of dollars. Police arrested 6 people yesterday. After questioning, the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office decided to keep Xia Weiteng (also known as Xia An) and his follower Zhou Wenhan in custody because they believe they are highly involved and might repeat the crime. So far, three people, including Zhou Zijun, are in custody. Xia Weiteng said he was asked by Chen Zhongyi to deal with the debt, but he denied threatening the female dentist or telling Zhou Zijun to hit her. He claimed he didn't know why the dentist was beaten. Dr. Shen said she lent Chen Zhongyi 15 million NT dollars, but he refused to pay back. Even after she won a lawsuit, he brought gang members to "negotiate" and demanded the mortgage documents back first. Police found that Xia Weiteng, Yan Daozhi, and Zhou Wenhan went to Dr. Shen's clinic to talk. They used gang names to scare her. Because the talks failed, they allegedly told Zhou Zijun to pretend to get a teeth cleaning and then beat Dr. Shen. On the day Dr. Shen was beaten, the clinic's air conditioner was being fixed, so there were no appointments in the morning. But Zhou Zijun insisted on seeing her. He also tried to switch seats when he saw a camera. Luckily, Dr. Shen didn't move, and the incident was recorded. Dr. Shen was badly injured. Zhou Zijun was already held in custody. Now, Xia Weiteng and Zhou Wenhan are also in custody.

**This May Was the Second Hottest on Record. This Year Is Likely to Be One of the Five Hottest Years Ever.**

Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau announced today that May 2025 was the second hottest May on record globally. This information comes from the latest climate reports by Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The global average temperature in May was 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than before the industrial age. NCEI also said that this year is very likely to be one of the five hottest years ever, with a probability of over 99%. Extreme heat happened around the world in May. The United Arab Emirates broke its May daily high temperature record on May 24th, reaching 51.6 degrees Celsius. Iceland had its worst May heatwave ever, with over 90% of weather stations recording new high temperatures for May. France also had a severe heatwave in May, with the national highest temperature reaching 30.5 degrees on May 30th, making it the hottest May on record for the country. This was only the second time since 1947 that the temperature went over 30 degrees in May. The Central Weather Bureau also noted that the Arctic sea ice has been near its lowest level since the beginning of the year. Although it recovered slightly in April, it still reached the lowest May record in the last five years. The ice is melting faster than average. The situation with Antarctic sea ice is also serious, with some areas almost completely ice-free. The weather bureau stated that the world's oceans are experiencing "marine heatwaves" with unusually high temperatures. This is causing big problems for ocean life and coastal areas, affecting both nature and the economy. It could also make climate change worse. The bureau said that global warming continues to affect places all over the world. The average global temperature from January to May 2025 was the second highest on record. NCEI also believes there's a very high chance (over 99%) that 2025 will be one of the five hottest years ever recorded.

**Guangzhou Jinan University Removed from China's Approved University List for First Time in 10 Years**

Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of approved universities and colleges in mainland China. Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from this list. This is the first change to the list in nearly ten years. After this change, there are still 154 universities and 191 vocational colleges on the list.

Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said earlier this year that schools controlled by China's United Front Work Department have special goals and are not purely academic. He stated that stopping cooperation with such schools is necessary and that Taiwan will no longer accept their degrees.

The Ministry of Education officially removed Guangzhou Jinan University because since 2019, it has been managed by China's United Front Work Department. The Ministry wants to make sure Taiwanese students study in a normal academic environment, free from political influence.

The Ministry also reminded that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair and respectful. Schools organizing trips to China should follow Taiwan's rules. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of events, the organizers, and the content to avoid political messages or one-sided offers.

The Ministry also advised schools to ask for help from the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education if they are unsure about any event organizers or plans. They want to encourage young people from both sides to learn together but also to be aware of possible risks and political intentions of event organizers.
