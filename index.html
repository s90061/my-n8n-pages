            <h1>Meta's AI Glasses Sales Triple, Boosting EssilorLuxottica's Profits</h1>
            <p>EssilorLuxottica, the world's biggest eyewear company, announced today that their "Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses," made with Meta, sold three times more in the first half of 2025. This increase helped the company make more money.</p>
            <p>In the first half of the year, EssilorLuxottica's total sales went up by 5.5% to 14 billion euros. Their net profit, which is the money they keep after all costs, grew a little by 1.6% to 1.4 billion euros.</p>
            <p>Francesco Milleri, the CEO of EssilorLuxottica, said that these results show the company is "moving forward with its growth goals," even though the world economy is not stable.</p>
            <p>EssilorLuxottica also said that sales of their AI (Artificial Intelligence) glasses grew much faster in the first half of this year. Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses sales increased more than three times compared to last year. The company also launched new Oakley glasses with AI in June.</p>
            <p>These Ray-Ban Meta glasses have a camera, headphones, and a microphone. Users don't need to open their phone; they just say "Hey, Meta" to start using Meta's AI features.</p>

            <h1>BBU Stocks Rise as Companies Prepare to Release Financial Reports</h1>
            <p>Major companies making BBU (Battery Backup Unit) products, such as Lite-On Technology and Delta Electronics, will hold meetings with investors on July 30th and 31st. Also, AES-KY, a company making battery modules, plans to release its financial report for the second quarter on Thursday. Because of this, the prices of BBU-related stocks have started to go up.</p>
            <p>Even though the Taiwan stock market dropped by 211.46 points today, AES-KY's stock price went up to its highest limit of NT$1200, staying in the "thousand-dollar club" of high-priced stocks. Gabay also saw its stock price increase by NT$1.7, or 4.97%, closing at NT$35.9.</p>
            <p>Delta Electronics, a large and important company, saw its stock price go up by NT$3, closing at NT$525. Lite-On Technology's stock price stayed the same at NT$124.5, showing good resistance against the market's fall.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA will launch its new GB300 AI servers later this year. BBU is a standard part of these new servers, and more and more servers are using them. Lite-On Technology, a big maker of power supplies and BBU modules, said before that BBU supply is very tight. They cannot meet all customer needs. So, at the start of the year, they began increasing production at their factories in Kaohsiung, North America, and other places. They expect to finish expanding their production capacity by the third quarter. This will likely cause more demand for battery modules from other companies.</p>
            <p>Lite-On Technology will hold its investor meeting tomorrow. They are expected to give more details about the BBU market situation.</p>
            <p>Experts say that BBU works like this: if the main power suddenly stops, the system automatically switches to BBU power. This allows data stored in temporary memory (DRAM) to be quickly saved to a backup hard drive (SSD). This prevents losing important information if the power goes out. As many AI data centers are being built, BBU is becoming a necessary part of them. Experts believe that the demand for BBU will continue to grow.</p>
