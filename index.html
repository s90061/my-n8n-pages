            <h1>Afghanistan: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visits, discusses mining and joining Belt and Road</h1>
            <p>According to Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Kabul today. He told Kabul that China wants to explore for and mine minerals in Afghanistan. China also hopes Afghanistan will officially join its "Belt and Road" plan.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry said Wang Yi met with acting minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul. Both countries want to work together more in many areas.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released notes from the meeting. Wang Yi told Muttaqi that China will keep helping the Afghan government achieve lasting peace and stability. China also wants to build more political trust with Afghanistan and increase cooperation in trade, farming, and other areas.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi also said he hopes Afghanistan will continue to fight against the East Turkestan Islamic Movement terrorist group. He added that stronger security cooperation between China and Afghanistan will help their economic cooperation.</p>
            <p>Afghanistan's statement said, "Mr. Wang Yi also mentioned that China plans to start real mining activities this year."</p>
            <p>Experts say that poor Afghanistan has a lot of lithium, copper, and iron. These minerals can help China make its supply chain safer.</p>
            <p>In 2021, the Taliban, a strict Islamic group, took control of Afghanistan again. China was the first country to send an ambassador there. Beijing continues to try and build its relationship with the Taliban.</p>

            <h1>Recall team sweeps Zhubei with motorcycles, Lin Siming's Zhudong team promotes anti-recall</h1>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Hsinchu County and a group that wants to remove KMT legislator Lin Siming started a motorcycle parade today in Zhubei City. They encouraged people to vote yes to remove him. On the other hand, Lin Siming also started a car parade in Zhudong Township to ask people to vote no to his removal.</p>
            <p>The vote to remove Lin Siming, who represents Hsinchu County's second election area, will be on August 23rd. The DPP's Hsinchu County office and the recall group began their motorcycle parade in Zhubei. About 20 motorcycles had ribbons and flags saying "Vote Yes on 8/23, Big Recall." They broadcast their message along the way. Zhubei City council members Zeng Yuling and Shao Qiyue came to support them.</p>
            <p>Chen Yutong, the head of the DPP's Hsinchu County office, spoke to reporters. He said that with voting day coming soon, they are back in Zhubei this week to promote their message and keep the public's power strong.</p>
            <p>On the other side, Lin Siming was with KMT legislator Luo Zhiqiang for a car parade in Zhudong's city center. Before the event, Lin told reporters that he continues to work on laws in the parliament and get projects for the local area. He said he will keep solving problems for the people.</p>
            <p>Luo Zhiqiang said that Lin Siming works hard and is always at the forefront of laws that help people's lives. He hopes that the hardworking Lin Siming can provide more services and help Hsinchu. He asked people to vote no to the recall.</p>
            <p>Later, Lin Siming went to an event in Hsinchu City called "Support Referendum, Oppose Bad Recall." Luo Zhiqiang, KMT legislator Hsu Chiao-hsin, and Taiwan People's Party chairman Ko Wen-je also spoke there. Together, they asked voters to oppose the recall.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan-Japan immigration information sharing, JTEA: not assuming 'Taiwan contingency'</h1>
            <p>Foreign media reported that Taiwan and Japan signed an agreement to share information about foreigners who want to travel from Taiwan to Japan. This is to stop spies from entering Japan during a crisis. The Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association (JTEA) confirmed today that they signed a memorandum last year to share immigration information. But they said it is not because they expect a "Taiwan contingency" (a possible crisis in Taiwan).</p>
            <p>Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun" newspaper quoted sources who said that Japan and Taiwan signed a memorandum. This was to prepare for a possible emergency in Taiwan, called a "Taiwan contingency." The agreement allows them to share information about foreigners who want to enter Japan from Taiwan. This is to stop spies from coming into Japan during a difficult time.</p>
            <p>The Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association answered questions from CNA in the evening. They said that on December 18th last year, the JTEA and the Taiwan-Japan Relations Association signed a "Memorandum of Cooperation Between the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association and the Taiwan-Japan Relations Association Regarding Information Sharing on Immigration Matters." In Chinese, this is temporarily translated as a memorandum for cooperation on sharing immigration information.</p>
            <p>The JTEA explained that this agreement helps both associations share immigration information. This helps the correct authorities in Japan and Taiwan do their jobs well according to immigration laws. The JTEA added that this agreement was not made because they think there will be a "Taiwan contingency."</p>
            <p>In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said on the evening of the 19th that Taiwan and Japan have not signed an agreement specifically about a "Taiwan contingency." Taiwan has also not given out any information about this on its own. However, Taiwan is happy to see both sides continue to improve and work together on immigration matters, building a closer partnership.</p>
