            <h1>Venezuela Claims 8 US Warships and 1200 Missiles Are Targeting It</h1>
            <p>Today, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said that eight US warships are aiming "1200 missiles" at his country. He called this a "dangerous threat."</p>
            <p>Reports from AFP state that the government of US President Donald Trump accused Maduro of leading groups that sell drugs. The US had already sent warships to the southern Caribbean Sea to stop drug activities. But the US had not openly threatened to attack Venezuela.</p>
            <p>Maduro spoke to international news groups today. He strongly criticized the US, saying, "Eight US warships with 1200 missiles and one submarine are targeting Venezuela." He also said this is "the biggest threat our continent (South America) has faced in the past 100 years."</p>
            <p>Maduro announced, "We have put our country on the highest level of military alert to protect Venezuela, because of this extreme military pressure."</p>
            <p>Authorities in Caracas said they will patrol Venezuela's waters. They will also gather over 4 million citizen soldiers to prepare for the US "threat."</p>
            <p>Maduro also claimed that the ways to talk with the US are now broken. He promised that Venezuela "will never give in to any kind of pressure or threat."</p>

            <h1>Ukraine Says Russia's Diplomacy Failed as SCO Summit Declaration Did Not Mention Russia-Ukraine War</h1>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine stated that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit declaration did not talk about Russia's war against Ukraine. Ukraine believes this shows that Russia's attempts to get other countries to support it have failed.</p>
            <p>The SCO held a big meeting in Tianjin from August 31 to September 1. Leaders there signed the Tianjin Declaration. The 10 countries that are members of the SCO include Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released an official statement today. It said that it is important that the Tianjin Declaration did not mention the war between Russia and Ukraine. The statement found it "surprising that such an important paper did not mention the biggest war in Europe since World War II, but it did mention many other wars, terror attacks, and events around the world."</p>
            <p>The statement also said that because the SCO summit declaration did not mention the Russia-Ukraine war, it proves Russia's efforts in diplomacy have failed. It explained that the Kremlin tried to make it seem like other countries had different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine. It also tried to make people believe that "countries outside of Europe and North America had a good view of Russia regarding why the war started, what happened because of it, and how to end it." But, this attempt did not work again.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine repeated its strong belief. It said that all countries that want peace must follow international laws and the rules of the United Nations Charter when they think about Russia's attack on Ukraine. It also added, "China plays an important role in world politics. We would be happy if Beijing took a more active part in bringing peace to Ukraine, based on its respect for the UN Charter."</p>

            <h1>Female Boxer Khelif Appeals to Sports Court Over World Boxing Genetic Test Rule</h1>
            <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport announced today that Algerian female boxer Imane Khelif has made an appeal. Last year, she had a discussion about her gender during the Paris Olympics. She wants to change the rule from World Boxing (WB) that asks for genetic testing.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said in a statement that World Boxing (WB) decided Khelif could not join upcoming WB events if she did not take a genetic test first. Khelif is fighting against this decision.</p>
            <p>Khelif and a talented boxer from Taiwan, Lin Yu-ting, both had gender discussions during the Paris Olympics. In the end, both of them won gold medals. Lin Yu-ting will not be at the WB World Boxing Championships this week in Liverpool, UK.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-ting completed all her necessary tests over a month ago and gave the reports to WB. It is understood that WB needs 4 to 6 weeks to discuss the general case. Because of this, Lin Yu-ting cannot take part in this year's World Championships right now.</p>
            <p>Khelif, who is 26 years old, said last month that it was not true that her former agent claimed she had stopped her career as a professional boxer.</p>
            <p>Khelif wrote on Facebook, "I want to make it clear to everyone that the news about me stopping boxing is false."</p>
            <p>She accused her former agent, Nasser Yesfah, of "breaking (my) trust and betraying (my) country with untrue and unkind words."</p>
            <p>She clearly stated, "This person cannot speak for me anymore."</p>
