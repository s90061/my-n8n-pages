Many are finding it a relaxing and rewarding hobby. Supermarkets are reporting an increase in sales of fresh ingredients and cooking equipment. Experts say this trend is likely to continue as people focus on healthier eating and saving money.

This change is happening because companies want to attract and keep good workers. Flexible work can help employees balance their work and personal lives. Some research shows that flexible work can also make people more productive. While not all jobs can be done remotely, many companies are exploring how they can offer more flexibility.
