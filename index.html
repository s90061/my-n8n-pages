            <h1>Vance: Russia-Ukraine peace deal unlikely to satisfy both sides; US continues negotiations</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C., August 10th (CNA) â€“ US Vice President JD Vance said that even if Russia and Ukraine agree on a solution, it probably won't make either side completely happy. In the end, both Moscow and Kyiv might be "unhappy" with any agreement.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the US wants to help find a solution that both countries can accept.</p>
            <p>On Fox News's "Sunday Morning Futures" show, Vance said, "Not everyone will be very happy. In the end, both Russia and Ukraine might be unhappy with the result."</p>
            <p>On August 8th, US President Trump said he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15th. They will talk about how to end the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Trump said that Russia and Ukraine could quickly agree to end the 3.5-year conflict. He also suggested that Ukraine might have to give up a lot of land.</p>
            <p>However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said yesterday that Ukraine cannot break its constitution on land issues. He stated, "Ukrainians will not give their land to those who occupy it."</p>
            <p>In an interview recorded on August 8th, Vance said the US is trying to arrange a meeting between Putin, Zelenskiy, and Trump. But he believes that if Putin meets Zelenskiy before meeting Trump, it won't be very effective.</p>
            <p>Late last night, White House officials said Trump is open to a meeting with both leaders. But for now, the White House is preparing for a meeting between just Trump and Putin, which Putin suggested.</p>

            <h1>Child preventive healthcare planned to increase to 9 times, earliest implementation in 2026</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 11th (CNA) â€“ Every child is precious. The National Health Agency hopes to get over 100 million NT dollars to add two more child health check-ups. They plan to add one check-up for babies aged 4 to 10 months and another for children aged 3 to 7 years. This could start as early as 2026.</p>
            <p>Shen Ching-fen became the new head of the National Health Agency on August 1st. Today was her first press conference. She used to be a doctor who treated children's infections and worked on the Health Taiwan Committee. She has been a doctor, a researcher, and now she helps make national policies. She said she talks to people every day to get new ideas and reach the goal of a healthy Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Shen Ching-fen, who has left the Health Taiwan Committee, still cares most about women and children's health. She said that besides making fertility support better and wider, she will also look after the physical and mental health of new mothers. They are thinking about increasing child health check-ups from 7 to 9 times. This will help make children healthier.</p>
            <p>Wei Hsi-lun, the Deputy Head of the National Health Agency, explained that they are discussing adding more child health check-ups. They want to add one check for babies aged 4 to 10 months. Also, children aged 3 to 7 currently only have one check, so they want to add another. This will make the checks happen more often. They think this will cost over 100 million NT dollars and they need to get the money. If they get the money, they hope to start next year.</p>
            <p>Currently, child health check-ups are given at these times: within 6 days of birth, from birth to 2 months, 2 to 4 months, 4 to 10 months, 10 months to 1.5 years, 1.5 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, and 3 to under 7 years. These checks include screening for newborn genetic problems, hearing checks for newborns, and checks for height, weight, head size, nutrition, hernias, undescended testicles, and hip joint movement.</p>
            <p>As children grow, the check-ups also look at how they develop. This includes if they can roll over, reach for things, hear sounds well, take a cloth off their face, crawl, stand with support, wave goodbye, say "ba" and "ma," walk, hold a cup, copy actions, say single words, understand spoken instructions, show things with their bodies, share interesting things, and use objects as toys.</p>

            <h1>China warns Philippines not to 'play with fire' over Taiwan Strait comments; Philippine President: 'Just stating facts'</h1>
            <p>Manila, August 11th (CNA) â€“ Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. recently said that if there is a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the Philippines cannot stay out of it. China protested these comments. Today, at a press conference, President Marcos Jr. said he was just stating facts and that he does not understand China's protest.</p>
            <p>Last week, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. visited India. In an interview there, he said that if a fight happens in the Taiwan Strait, the Philippines will not be able to avoid it.</p>
            <p>On August 8th, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Philippines had twisted the "One China principle" and hurt relations between China and the Philippines. China asked the Philippines to truly follow the One China principle and the spirit of their diplomatic agreement. China warned the Philippines not to "play with fire" on issues important to China.</p>
            <p>Today, President Marcos Jr. responded at a press conference in MalacaÃ±ang Palace, the Philippine presidential residence. He said, "I don't know what they are talking about. Playing with fire? I am just stating facts."</p>
            <p>He stressed that the Philippines does not want to start a war. However, he believes that if a war happens in Taiwan, the Philippines will be involved no matter what. So, they must plan, especially how to get Filipinos living in Taiwan out and how to protect their own country.</p>
            <p>President Marcos Jr. repeated that even though the Philippines does not want conflict with any country, if war starts in Taiwan, it will surely be pulled in. "That is what I want to say, and that is why I don't understand why people say the Philippines is playing with fire or trying to cause trouble," he added.</p>
            <p>On another topic, about Chinese warships and coast guard ships still "entering" waters claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea, President Marcos Jr. said again that he has no special orders. He will let the relevant departments continue patrolling the South China Sea and protecting their land, as they always do.</p>
            <p>Angelito Banayo, a former Philippine representative to Taiwan, recently told CNA that if a war starts in the Taiwan Strait, it will be hard for the Philippines not to be involved. Besides geography, the most important reason is that the United States has three military bases in northern Philippines through the "Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement" (EDCA). These bases all face Taiwan and point towards China.</p>
            <p>If war happens, these bases could easily become targets for China's attacks.</p>
            <p>Banayo also said that President Marcos Jr.'s interview in India was a practical talk about the safety of 200,000 Filipinos living in Taiwan. It does not necessarily mean that the Philippines is giving up its "One China policy."</p>
            <p>Lucio Pitlo III, a researcher at the Asia Pacific Pathways to Progress Foundation (APPFI) in the Philippines, also said that Beijing will certainly be unhappy with President Marcos Jr.'s words. However, the Philippines has the right to make its own decisions in foreign affairs.</p>
            <p>Pitlo also mentioned that ASEAN countries might ask the Philippines to help take out and temporarily shelter their citizens. These are all complex problems that the Philippines might face.</p>
