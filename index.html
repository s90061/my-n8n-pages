            <h1>Peng Jin-lung: Financial Commission Will Promote a Big Feedback Plan in 3 Steps</h1>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung, the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), explained a plan called "Financial Big Feedback." This plan will happen in three steps. First, the FSC will ask financial companies to think about how they can give back when they start new businesses. They should also create their own special ways to give back. Second, companies will be asked to show information about their feedback plans on their websites or in documents. Finally, the FSC will check these plans and support good efforts with positive actions.</p>
            <p>Today, Mr. Peng spoke at a forum about financial feedback. He said that the FSC first thought of this plan in December last year. The idea is to encourage financial companies to use money from the public and gain trust by doing helpful things. If people trust the financial system, the financial market can grow more. This was the main idea behind the plan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Peng also noted that many studies support the idea of financial feedback. If financial companies care about giving back to society and doing good for the environment and society (ESG), it brings many benefits. Taking good care of employees can also make a company more competitive, and international investors will want to invest in such companies. Giving back can mean raising salaries, improving benefits, and offering training for employees. It also includes giving back to customers, for example, by making services better and offering better product conditions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Peng mentioned that financial groups gave a lot of money during the recent storms in central and southern Taiwan. This is a good example of financial feedback. He hopes that every financial company will create its own unique feedback plan. He wants these plans to be more organized, complete, and forward-looking.</p>
            <p>The FSC plans to push the "Financial Big Feedback" plan through three stages: encouraging, showing information, and checking with support.</p>
            <p>Mr. Peng explained that the first step is to help financial companies make giving back to society a main part of how they operate. At first, this will be done by encouraging them. They will be asked to think about how to give back when they apply for new business activities. The ways and people they help are not limited. For example, in the Kaohsiung asset area, where many new business trials are happening, companies have already written in their applications how they will give back when their businesses make money.</p>
            <p>Second, financial companies are encouraged to include their feedback plans in public documents or on their websites (like in sustainability reports). By showing their social responsibility plans and activities in an organized way, companies can create their own special financial feedback without having to compare themselves to others.</p>
            <p>The third stage is checking the plans. Mr. Peng said that the FSC will give positive encouragement and support, such as through checks and official actions, to financial companies that do well. They hope this will encourage others in the industry and help everyone work together on the financial feedback plan. The goal is to make financial companies connect more with society, create new financial value that people can feel and share, and show that financial companies are more than just cold numbers and deals; they can also be close to people.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tong Cheng-chang, head of the FSC's banking bureau, said that financial work is naturally about serving society. A stable society helps finance grow. He hopes financial companies can build trust and make their brand stronger. He also offered four areas for different ways of giving back: improving financial education and knowledge, helping local communities and people who need help, supporting green finance and long-term growth, and being responsible as a company.</p>

            <h1>Gao Yuzhen Works with BL Actor, Has No Plans to Marry and Lives Happily</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese actress Gao Yuzhen attended a press conference today to promote her own brand. Two male actors, Zhang Zhewei and Chen Junting, who are famous from Boys' Love (BL) dramas, joined her. Gao Yuzhen shared that she has been with her boyfriend for over seven years. She does not plan to get married right now. She believes that being happy in life is more important at the moment.</p>
            <p>Gao Yuzhen looked bright and happy at the press conference for her brand, with Zhang Zhewei and Chen Junting by her side. Gao Yuzhen said that her boyfriend suggested she work with these two actors. She laughed and said that she and her boyfriend often share information about attractive people they know.</p>
            <p>Zhang Zhewei joked that he grew up watching Gao Yuzhen in 8 PM TV shows, and he was a loyal fan of "The Wife" and "Night Market Life." Chen Junting said he was excited and hopeful to work with Gao Yuzhen this time. He praised her as a very good senior in the acting world. They also agreed to sing and dance together in the future.</p>
            <p>Gao Yuzhen and her boyfriend have been together for more than seven years, and she currently has no plans to marry. She said, "Getting married is not the most important thing in my life right now, although it is still important. But at my age, being happy is the most important." Gao Yuzhen also believes that love and marriage are good, but a woman's career should be separate from a man's. Gao Yuzhen often asks her boyfriend for advice on her work. Her boyfriend was the one who suggested she work with Zhang Zhewei and Chen Junting.</p>
            <p>When asked about her side business, which is cosmetics, Gao Yuzhen said that making over 100 million NTD in sales is a basic goal. She admitted that the cost of developing products is very high, so sales also need to grow. When asked if she will focus only on her side business, Gao Yuzhen replied, "I will not leave the entertainment industry. Every part of me is who I am. An artist can't really leave the entertainment industry forever; they will still be looked at and talked about."</p>
            <p>In the future, Gao Yuzhen will continue to do different kinds of work. She still has plans for her acting career. She hopes to sing warm songs for everyone to comfort them.</p>

            <h1>Trump Raises Tariffs: Canadian Prime Minister Says Over 85% of US-Canada Trade Remains Duty-Free</h1>
            <p>After US President Donald Trump recently increased taxes (tariffs) on some Canadian goods, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said today that more than 85% of trade between the US and Canada is still free of these taxes.</p>
            <p>Carney had said he was unhappy with Trump's decision last week to raise tariffs on certain Canadian imports from 25% to 35%. This new rule started on August 1st.</p>
            <p>But Carney emphasized that it is very important that Trump decided to keep tax exemptions for all goods that follow the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Trump signed this agreement during his first time as president and spoke highly of it.</p>
            <p>Carney stated in British Columbia, on Canada's west coast, that the average tariff rate Canada faces from the US is currently one of the lowest among all countries.</p>
            <p>He said, "More than 85% of US-Canada trade continues to be tax-free in both directions."</p>
            <p>Trump defended his decision to raise tariffs on Canadian goods by saying that Canada has not done enough to stop fentanyl from entering the US. Fentanyl has caused a big drug problem in the US.</p>
            <p>Carney pointed out that the amount of fentanyl coming into the US from Canada is "almost nothing" compared to other sources.</p>
            <p>According to US data, from 2022 to 2024, fentanyl found at the US-Canada border was less than 0.1% of all fentanyl found.</p>
            <p>Carney told reporters that he has not spoken with Trump since the tariffs were announced last week.</p>
            <p>He said, "We will talk when the time is right." He also hoped that negotiators from both sides can still work towards a full agreement between the two countries.</p>
