            <h1>Strong Economy Boosts US Dollar, Wall Street Stocks Fall Again</h1>
            <p>New York, September 25 â€“ The main stock markets on Wall Street fell again today. This happened because new economic information from the United States was better than expected. This good news might make the US central bank (Fed) wait longer to cut interest rates. At the same time, the US dollar became stronger.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the US government reported today that the economy grew faster than first thought in the second quarter. The yearly growth rate was changed from 3.3% to 3.8%. This was mainly because people spent more money than expected.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 173.96 points, which is 0.38%. It closed at 45947.32 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index went down by 33.25 points, or 0.50%. It closed at 6604.72 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology companies, fell by 113.16 points, or 0.50%. It closed at 22384.70 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped by 12.32 points, or 0.20%. It closed at 6284.67 points.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Stable as Russia Limits Fuel Exports, But US Economic Growth Affects Rate Cut Hopes</h1>
            <p>New York, September 25 â€“ International oil prices stayed steady today after reaching their highest point in seven weeks yesterday. Russia plans to limit how much fuel it exports until the end of the year. However, the United States increased its final economic growth number for the second quarter. This made people less hopeful about further interest rate cuts, which stopped oil prices from rising more.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures went up by 11 cents, or 0.16%. It closed at $69.42 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures dropped slightly by 1 cent, or 0.02%. It closed at $64.98 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Secretary to Speak to High-Ranking Military Officers; Hundreds of Generals Called to Attend</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 25 â€“ The US Department of Defense announced today that Secretary Hegseth will speak to high-ranking US military officers early next week. Earlier, some US media reported that Hegseth made a very unusual order for hundreds of top US military personnel, both in the country and overseas, to attend this talk.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that Pete Hegseth has ordered all one-star generals and higher, who are currently in command roles, and their most senior non-commissioned officer advisors, to come to the Quantico military base in Virginia on September 30.</p>
            <p>The report also quoted someone who said, "Everyone is worried and doesn't know what this means."</p>
            <p>CNN also reported, based on US officials, that the Pentagon has called hundreds of generals to this meeting.</p>
            <p>AFP asked the US Department of Defense about The Washington Post's report. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell only replied in a statement, saying that Hegseth "will speak to senior US military leaders early next week." He did not explain or give more details.</p>
            <p>In May, Hegseth ordered a big cut in the number of active US generals. It is not clear if next week's meeting is related to this.</p>
