The US and Russia announced that US Secretary of State Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov met today to talk openly about the war in Ukraine. This happened while Washington was saying Moscow was not flexible enough.

According to AFP, Rubio said that Lavrov shared new ideas to solve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Rubio promised to tell President Trump about them but said it was unlikely to lead to a quick solution.

Just hours before the meeting, Moscow had heavily bombed Kyiv for two nights in a row. The United Nations reported that the number of people killed by Russian attacks was the highest in three years. This week, Trump criticized Russian President Putin for "talking nonsense" about Ukraine. It's worth noting that Trump had previously helped Russia and Ukraine start talks for the first time in three years.

Even though Trump had many calls with Putin, his efforts to achieve a ceasefire did not get any agreements from the Kremlin. Rubio told reporters that Lavrov had new ideas for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but he did not give many details. Rubio said, "This isn't a new way, but a new idea or concept that I will take back to discuss with the President." He also said it was not a plan that would "automatically bring peace," but it "could open the door to a path."

Rubio stated, "I agree with the President's words; I am disappointed and frustrated by the lack of progress." He also criticized Moscow for not being "flexible." When asked by AFP, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the US would send more weapons to Kyiv and that he knew the "specific dates" they would arrive.

Leaders from the UK and France also announced that they are ready to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said he had spoken with Trump and was "working closely with allies to make sure Ukraine gets the help it needs."

**Columbia University Student Supporting Palestine Wants US Government to Pay Almost NT$600 Million After Arrest**

Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and supporter of Palestine, was released on bail after being held by US immigration for over three months. Today, he asked President Trump's government to pay him 20 million US dollars for his arrest and detention.

Reuters reported that Khalil's lawyers today asked the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State for money. This is based on a law that allows people to claim money directly from the government before suing. Government officials have six months to reply. 20 million US dollars is about 590 million New Taiwan Dollars.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security called Khalil's request "ridiculous." They also said that the Trump government's arrest of Khalil was legal. Khalil, who is 30 years old and of Palestinian background, is a permanent resident of the US. He was arrested in March and held for several months. The Trump government said his support for Palestine was hurting US-Israel relations and tried to send him out of the country.

In a tough legal fight, Khalil's lawyers said that the Trump government's actions against him were for political reasons and were against the constitution. Khalil was set free on June 20. Khalil told Reuters today, "I hope this will stop the government... Trump has made it clear that he only cares about money."

Khalil also said he would accept an official apology and a promise from the government that they would no longer arrest, hold, or try to deport anyone for supporting Palestine. AFP reported that Khalil said in a statement that this lawsuit is "the first step towards holding people accountable." He added, "Nothing can fix those 104 days that were taken from me, which caused me trauma, separated me from my wife, and made me miss the birth of my first child." He also said, "Political revenge and misuse of power must be answered for."

Republican Donald Trump has said that protests against Israel's war in Gaza are anti-Semitic and has promised to deport foreign students who take part in such activities. Khalil was the first person targeted by this policy. His case caused strong protests from people who support Palestine and civil rights groups. They believe the government should not mix criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.

**Taipei City Plans Temporary Protection for Trees; Damaging Them During Review Can Lead to NT$100,000 Fine**

Taipei City's Department of Cultural Affairs is planning a new system to temporarily protect old trees. This is to stop them from being cut down while it's decided if they should be protected. During this review period, trees will be considered protected. If anyone damages them, they could be fined up to NT$100,000. The plan is expected to be sent to the city council for review by the end of the year.

Last year, groups reported several old trees in an alley on Muzha Road Section 1 in Taipei as protected trees. However, these trees were cut down while documents were being processed, which caused a lot of discussion. Following advice from the Taipei City Tree Protection Committee, the Cultural Affairs Department began changing the "Taipei City Tree Protection Self-Governance Ordinance." They added a rule that trees are considered protected during the review period.

The Cultural Affairs Department recently announced a draft amendment. It says that trees nominated for protection will be temporarily protected from the start of the evaluation process. This means they will follow the rules of the Taipei City Tree Protection Ordinance. So, if old trees are cut down or damaged during the review, people could face fines from NT$50,000 to NT$100,000.

Also, the draft changes the standards for identifying protected trees. It now has detailed measurements for the height and circumference of broadleaf trees, conifer trees, and fig trees (from the Moraceae family).

The Cultural Affairs Department said today that the draft has finished its public announcement phase. They are now collecting comments from different groups. It will then be sent to the city government's legal committee and city council meetings for approval. It is expected to go to the city council for review by the end of the year.
