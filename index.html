            <h1>Taylor Swift Gets Engaged, Sports World Celebrates; MLB Team Jokes No One Cares About Their Schedule</h1>
            <p>American pop superstar Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, a player for the NFL Kansas City Chiefs, announced their engagement on social media today. The sports world celebrated. The Cleveland Guardians, a Major League Baseball (MLB) team, joked that no one cares about next year's game schedule now.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce started dating publicly in 2023. The Chiefs team posted on social media with a red heart and engagement ring emojis. They wrote, "Today is like a fairy tale. Congratulations to Kelce and Taylor Swift! We are so happy you are now permanent members of the Chiefs Kingdom family!"</p>
            <p>Kelce has won three Super Bowl championships with his team, the most recent one last year.</p>
            <p>The NFL also posted congratulations. On the social media platform X, they shared a photo of Kelce on one knee proposing to Taylor Swift in a garden full of flowers. They wrote, "Congratulations to Kelce and Taylor Swift."</p>
            <p>The NFL also released a video of the two at a Super Bowl celebration with confetti falling. Taylor Swift said to the camera, "This is crazy, I can't believe this is really happening, I'm still in shock." The NFL wrote, "Us too."</p>
            <p>The official ATP Tour for men's tennis posted a video of Taylor Swift and Kelce at the US Open. They congratulated the couple on their happy news and said, "At that moment, we knew they were meant to be together."</p>
            <p>Also, MLB just announced its 2026 season schedule. But then, social media was filled with news of Taylor Swift's engagement. The Cleveland Guardians responded humorously. They wrote on X, "Thank you, Taylor Swift. Now nobody cares that next year's schedule is out."</p>

            <p>The US team wrote, "Thank you, Taylor Swift and Kelce, for choosing to announce your 'small' news today. The 'big' news will come out tomorrow."</p>

            <h1>Taichung Police Find Foreign Women Providing Sex Services, One Claims to Be an Active AV Actress</h1>
            <p>The Sixth Precinct of the Taichung City Police Department announced today that they found women offering sex services who came to Taiwan as tourists. Besides Thai women, there were also three Japanese women. One of them said she was an "active AV actress" and charged NT$20,000.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Precinct of the Taichung City Police Department explained that they sent 22 police officers recently. They had a search warrant from the Taichung District Court. They searched hotels and rented apartments in Xitun District for illegal sex services. They found women providing sex services in a motel who came to Taiwan as tourists. They also found someone who seemed to be an "active AV actress."</p>
            <p>During the search, police found several Taiwanese and Thai women who were having sex with clients. They also found three Japanese women in the motel. One of them claimed to be an "active AV actress." Police saw her personal items and open luggage in her room. This showed that she was using the place for a short stay and to offer sex services.</p>
            <p>Police said that the service cost between NT$4,000 and NT$5,000 for 50 minutes. The Japanese women, especially the one who claimed to be an "active AV actress" with "works," charged as high as NT$20,000. However, when the police arrived, there was no sex happening in her room. The Japanese woman was sitting on the bed, dressed neatly, waiting for customers. It seemed her high price made customers not want to pay.</p>
            <p>Police reported that the operation found 15 people in total, including Taiwanese, Thai, and Japanese women, and workers. The people running the service rented hotel rooms as places for prostitution. They used messaging apps to talk to customers to avoid being caught. Many of these foreign women entered Taiwan with tourist visas, pretending to be tourists but actually offering sex services. The police will fine them according to the "Social Order Maintenance Act" and send them to the National Immigration Agency.</p>
            <p>Chief Chou Chun-Ming of the Sixth Precinct warned illegal businesses not to take chances. He said they should not use hotels or tourism as an excuse to do illegal sex work. He added that the police will continue to gather evidence and take action to keep Taichung safe and ensure its good image for tourism and the peace of its citizens.</p>

            <h1>Trump: If Putin Doesn't Agree to Ukraine Ceasefire, I Will Use Economic Sanctions Against Russia</h1>
            <p>Former U.S. President Trump said today that he is ready to put economic sanctions on Russia. This will happen if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to a ceasefire in the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump answered a reporter's question about whether Putin would face consequences. Trump said, "If I have to do it, the sanctions I have in mind are very, very serious. But I want to see the war end... We have economic sanctions. I am talking about economic measures because we will not get into a world war."</p>
            <p>Trump has been working to end the war, which has lasted for more than three years. He has not used the sanctions he often threatened against Putin. However, his efforts to help solve the problem have not worked so far.</p>
            <p>Trump wants a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin. Zelenskyy has agreed to such talks in principle, but Putin has not yet said yes. The Kremlin said there are no plans for such a meeting right now.</p>
            <p>Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting, "This will not be a world war, but it will be an economic war... An economic war will be bad, bad for Russia, and I don't want that."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Zelenskyy is not completely innocent either."</p>
            <p>Even though diplomatic talks are slow, officials from the U.S. and Europe have discussed possible security promises for Kyiv if a deal is made. These ideas include air support or sharing information.</p>
            <p>Trump has often suggested using economic tools to pressure countries at war. From tomorrow, August 27, he plans to add another 25% tax on goods that India exports to the U.S. This is to punish India for continuing to buy Russian oil. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil.</p>
            <p>Trump also hinted today that he might use "very expensive and strong tariffs on Russia or Ukraine" to achieve peace.</p>
