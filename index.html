            <h1>Ministry of Transportation Connects Companies to Help People Repair Homes</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and strong winds from the southwest have affected southern Taiwan. Some people's homes are badly damaged. The Ministry of Transportation said today that there are not enough workers or materials right now. So, they have asked different departments to help connect companies with residents. They hope to help people find workers to repair their homes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation posted on Facebook today that Vice Minister Chen Yen-po held a meeting yesterday. He gathered different departments to check on the repair work in the affected areas of Tainan. They also talked about how to continue helping. So far, they have visited over 100 damaged homes. They are still checking what people and resources they can use. They are working hard to help people rebuild their homes soon.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that because there are not enough workers and materials, people cannot find repair teams. Also, there are no workers or tools available. The government has asked all ministries to help. They have divided the affected areas, and the Ministry of Transportation is responsible for Xinying District, Yanshui District, Baihe District, and Houbi District in Tainan City.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that people who want to repair their homes can first register with their district chief. The Ministry of Transportation will then connect companies with residents. After that, residents will talk with the companies. Once they agree, they will sign a simple contract. The Ministry of Transportation's main job is to connect them; they do not pay money for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To make the repair work faster after the disaster, the Ministry of Transportation also set some rules for action. Besides connecting companies, they will first help old, one-story houses that have lost their roofs and are not safe to live in. This is urgent help. Also, old materials like asbestos tiles will be collected in one place. The district office will then help remove them.</p>
