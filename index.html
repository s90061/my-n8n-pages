            <h1>Matsu's "Tieban Burning Pagoda Festival" Celebrated by Thousands in the Village</h1>
            <p>The important Matsu folk festival, the "Tieban Burning Pagoda Festival," took place today in Ren'ai Village, Nangan Township. A thousand people filled the village, making it very crowded. During the creative parade, a group of elementary school students dressed up as "Sea Dragons" (a special forces unit). Their cute performance made the crowd clap and cheer loudly.</p>
            <p>Lienchiang County is having problems with a law about money distribution. So, its finances might be difficult next year. Lienchiang County Magistrate Wang Chung-ming spoke at the burning pagoda ceremony in the evening. He said that "burning pagodas" is a special tradition found only in Taiwan. In the past, people burned old things inside a brick pagoda. This meant bad luck would go away. Nowadays, people use "bad luck removal cards" instead. This year, he wrote "financial difficulties" on his card. He hopes that burning it will bring a lot of money to the county.</p>
            <p>The festival had many activities, starting in the afternoon, centered around Ren'ai Village's main street. First, villagers gathered at the entrance to the village. They made a traditional snack called "Baiwan" by hand using sticky rice. They also cooked special dishes for visitors. Over time, "Baiwan" has become less common on Matsu people's tables. Ms. Wang, who is from Beigan, said she was surprised to taste this delicious snack from her childhood memories at Tieban.</p>
            <p>Next, there was a creative parade with 10 teams. These included the "Philharmonic Theatre Factory," a performing group from the 3rd Matsu International Art Island. The local Tieban Community Development Association welcomed visitors. They played traditional Tieban drum music, which is a cultural heritage of Lienchiang County. They also showed a traditional custom where women carry things on a shoulder pole when visiting their parents' home.</p>
            <p>The "Sea Dragons" soldiers had been in Ren'ai Village for many decades. However, they were not in the parade this year because they moved to another place. But a group of elementary school students and their parents decided to join. They wore homemade "muscle suits" and copied the soldiers' movements. Their cute actions and faces made the people watching clap and cheer. Ms. Cao, a parent, said she hoped to bring joy to the visitors.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the "burning pagoda" was the main event. Nearly a thousand people went to Tieban Beach. The brick pagoda, which stands for bad luck going away, burned brightly. Everyone danced the "Wata dance" together to celebrate. Local art groups also performed songs and a stage play called "Walking on the Sea." This allowed visitors to enjoy a rich cultural celebration on the island as the sea wind blew at night.</p>

            <h1>Sudan's Civil War Continues; At Least 60 Dead After Attack on Shelter in Al-Fashir City</h1>
            <p>Sudan is still in a civil war. Local activists said that a group called the "Rapid Support Forces" (RSF) attacked a shelter in Al-Fashir city. They used drones and bombs last night and this morning. At least 60 people died. The RSF is a paramilitary group fighting against the government army.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Al-Fashir city in western Sudan is currently surrounded by the RSF. The RSF wants to take control of the last place the government army holds in the Darfur area.</p>
            <p>Because the RSF has surrounded the city, many people are hungry and sick. Drones and bombs continue to hit shelters for people who have lost their homes. They also hit mosques, hospitals, and clinics.</p>
            <p>The Al-Fashir Resistance Committee released a statement earlier today. It said: "Many bodies are still under fallen buildings. Also, some people burned to death inside the shelter's carriages. Children, women, and older people were all killed in a cruel way." The committee added that the shelter was hit by drones twice and bombed eight times.</p>
            <p>The Resistance Committee said that hundreds of regular people have died in these attacks. Residents who spoke to Reuters said they have dug holes in their homes and communities to protect themselves.</p>
            <p>The civil war in Sudan started on April 15, 2023. It is the worst human crisis in the world. 13 million people have had to leave their homes. More than 3.5 million of these people have gone to other countries. Tens of thousands of people have also died. There are still no signs of peace.</p>
            <p>The Rapid Support Forces are led by Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. He was once the deputy of General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads Sudan's government army. On April 15 this year, the RSF announced they had formed their own government. Countries around the world are worried that Sudan might split into two. Both sides in the war are accused of doing bad things to people.</p>

            <h1>China Airlines Starlight Night Marathon Draws Ten Thousand Runners to Dajia Riverside Park</h1>
            <p>The second China Airlines Starlight Night Marathon began today at Dajia Riverside Park in Taipei. Ten thousand runners joined the event. More than 300 of these runners came from other countries. This is 80% more foreign runners than last year. This shows that the event is becoming more international.</p>
            <p>This is the second year for the China Airlines Starlight Night Marathon. This year, there were three different races: a half marathon (21K), a fun run (10K), and a family run (5K).</p>
            <p>China Airlines said in a press release that registration for this year's race closed in just 24 hours because so many people signed up. China Airlines gave out many gifts to runners who finished the race. They also gave away 35 plane tickets and flight miles in a lucky draw. These prizes were for long-distance, regional, and domestic flights, and were worth over 3.3 million New Taiwan Dollars. All runners who finished also got special discounts on a limited number of flight seats for a short time.</p>
            <p>The China Airlines Starlight Night Marathon started today at Dajia Riverside Park in Taipei. China Airlines Chairman Kao Hsing-huang and Minister of Transportation Chen Shih-kai started the race together by firing a gun. General Manager Chen Han-ming led the 5K family fun run. He showed his support for a healthy new lifestyle by running himself.</p>
            <p>China Airlines said that ten thousand runners worked hard and sweated during the event. Also, more than 300 runners from other countries joined. This is 80% more foreign runners than last year. Many well-known runners were among them. For example, Hendrik Pfeiffer, who ran for Germany in the Tokyo Olympics marathon, was there. This further highlights that the China Airlines Marathon is becoming more international.</p>
