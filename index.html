            <h1>Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang Wants Clearer Rules for Drivers After Schoolchild is Hit at Crosswalk</h1>
            <p>A young boy from an elementary school in Keelung was hit by a taxi recently. The accident happened when the taxi was turning right and the boy was walking on a crosswalk in the city. The boy was hurt. Today, Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang visited the place where it happened. He suggested that the government should change the law. He wants the law to be clearer about how slow drivers must go when they are near crosswalks. This would help keep people walking safe.</p>
            <p>The accident took place on August 21st, around noon. A taxi was turning right from Ailiu Road to Renyi Road in Keelung City. It hit the boy who was on the crosswalk. The boy fell down and rolled a few times. An ambulance took him to the hospital. He had many scratches and bruises on his body. The police are now looking into the accident to find out exactly what happened.</p>
            <p>When Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang heard about the accident, he thought it was very important. This afternoon, he led different city departments to the accident site. These departments included traffic, public works, education, and police. They met there to discuss ways to make things better.</p>
            <p>At the meeting, some parents suggested a "full pedestrian phase" for traffic lights. This would mean that only people walking can cross at certain times, making it safer for children. A city council member, Cheng Wen-ting from the Democratic Progressive Party, suggested moving crosswalks back a little. Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang said that the city government will think about both ideas and plan for them.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang also said that the current law for traffic rules (Article 44 of the "Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act") only says that it is wrong "not to slow down when approaching a crosswalk without a traffic light." But this rule is not clear enough. It doesn't say exactly how slow drivers should go. He has asked the city's Department of Transportation to tell the Ministry of Transportation about this. He suggests that the central government should change the law to make it very clear. This would give more protection to people crossing the street.</p>
