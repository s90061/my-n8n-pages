            <h1>Removing Gongguan Roundabout: Sign Says "Construction Miracle," City Says They Will Finish Quickly</h1>
            <p>People still disagree about the project to remove the Gongguan Roundabout and fill in the underground passage in Taipei. Someone posted a picture online of a sign on the Shuiguan Market bridge. The sign said, "Wanan did it! A construction miracle! Removing it is smoother than not removing it." The head of the Department of Transportation, Hsieh Ming-Hung, said they will try their best to finish the work faster to cause fewer problems.</p>
            <p>The project to remove the Taipei Gongguan Roundabout and fill in the underground passage started on September 13. From September 22, it entered its second weekday week. People still have different opinions about this project. They think the city should first try improving road signs. An online post also showed the sign that read, "Wanan did it! A construction miracle! Removing it is smoother than not removing it."</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-Hung told the Central News Agency by phone that he could not guess why the sign was put up. He said the Department of Transportation is now working hard to make the construction time shorter. This is because filling the underground passage means two fewer lanes for cars, which might affect traffic.</p>
            <p>He also explained that they have plans to help with traffic. These plans include working with New Taipei City to watch all car traffic, changing how long traffic lights stay green at crossings, and asking volunteer traffic police to keep roads clear. They want to make sure traffic on Keelung Road (east-west) and Roosevelt Road (north-south) does not get blocked.</p>
            <p>Huang Hui-Ju, the deputy director of the Traffic Engineering Division, said that the city government did not say what was written on the sign. She said that during construction, they will try hard to keep traffic normal. She also said they did not promise that traffic would be better than before construction. The main reason for doing the construction is to reduce accidents.</p>
            <p>Regarding the sign, she said they would tell the New Construction Office. If it is an illegal advertisement without permission, it will be taken down.</p>
            <p>Also, she said that today, because of Typhoon Kajasa, the rain would affect driving and cause more traffic jams. The Traffic Control Center of the Traffic Engineering Division said that from 7:30 AM to 8:00 AM today, traffic going north on Roosevelt Road into Taipei City was very slow. They will make the traffic lights stay green longer to help. Police officers will also guide traffic at crossings to keep it moving. Also, even though cars on Yongfu Bridge and Fuhe Bridge were moving slowly, it was not as bad as in the past.</p>

            <h1>After Kirk's Death, Trump Calls Antifa a Terrorist Group in the Country</h1>
            <p>The White House in the U.S. said that President Trump signed an order today. This order names a left-wing group called "Antifa" as a terrorist group in the country. This happened after Charlie Kirk, a conservative online personality, was killed.</p>
            <p>News from AFP and Reuters says that Trump's order states, "Because there is a pattern of political violence that tries to stop legal political activities and block the rule of law, I am now calling Antifa a 'domestic terrorist organization'."</p>
            <p>Here is some background about Antifa and why it might be hard for Trump's government to stop them as he wants:</p>
            <p><ul><li><b>Why is Trump doing this now?</b></li></ul></p>
            <p>After the conservative online personality Charlie Kirk was killed earlier this month, Trump promised to act against left-wing groups he blames for causing violence.</p>
            <p>There is no public proof right now that Antifa was involved in Kirk's death. Officials say they don't know why the shooter, Tyler Robinson, killed Kirk. Robinson has also refused to work with the people investigating the case.</p>
            <p>However, Trump still calls Antifa a "sick, dangerous, extreme left-wing problem." He has also promised to find out where they get their money.</p>
            <p><ul><li><b>What kind of group is Antifa?</b></li></ul></p>
            <p>Antifa is not a traditional organized political group. A report from the U.S. Congressional Research Service in 2020 said that Antifa is a movement without a main center. It does not have a clear organization, chain of command, or leaders.</p>
            <p>Some experts who study extreme politics, and also Christopher Wray, a former head of the FBI, say it is better to think of Antifa as an idea against fascism and white supremacy. It is not one strong group. Because of this, it is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which gives people freedom of speech.</p>
            <p><ul><li><b>Where did Antifa start?</b></li></ul></p>
            <p>The Antifa movement started from anti-fascist movements in Europe in the early 1900s. After Trump became president in the U.S. in 2016, Antifa became more known in the country.</p>
            <p><ul><li><b>How is Antifa organized?</b></li></ul></p>
            <p>Antifa is made up of many small local groups. These groups work alone, but they might share plans, ideas, and resources by meeting in person or using special messaging apps.</p>
            <p>According to a Reuters report and a 2020 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), people in this movement form "affinity groups." These are informal groups of 3 to 8 people. Members trust and protect each other during protests.</p>
            <p><ul><li><b>How does Antifa work?</b></li></ul></p>
            <p>People who support Antifa believe in "direct action." This can be street protests, or it can become more violent, like burning police cars or breaking windows. The CSIS report says that people often wear black clothes and cover their faces.</p>
            <p>Online, they might follow right-wing groups or find and share information about people they think are extreme right-wing.</p>
            <p><ul><li><b>Has Antifa been involved in violence?</b></li></ul></p>
            <p>U.S. law enforcement agencies say that there have never been terrorist attacks in the U.S. linked to Antifa. Trump first said he wanted to call Antifa a terrorist group in 2020, during protests after George Floyd, an African American man, died.</p>
            <p>In August 2020, in Portland, Oregon, there was a well-known event linked to Antifa. Michael Reinoehl, who said he supported Antifa, shot and killed Aaron "Jay" Danielson, a member of a far-right group called "Patriot Prayer." Later, federal and local police officers shot and killed Reinoehl when they tried to arrest him.</p>
            <p>Recently, a jury in San Diego found two men guilty of planning a riot. This case came from street protests in 2021. Prosecutors said these two men were members of Antifa.</p>

            <h1>Trump: Don't Rush Hepatitis B Vaccine; Painkillers May Link to Autism Risk in Children</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump said today that there is "no reason" to give newborns the Hepatitis B vaccine right away. He also warned pregnant women to avoid an over-the-counter painkiller called Tylenol. He said its main ingredient might be connected to a risk of autism in children.</p>
            <p>News from AFP and the UK's "Guardian" newspaper says that Trump today asked for big changes to the usual vaccine schedule for babies. He said, without proof, that there is "no reason" for newborns to get the Hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B cannot be fully cured and spreads easily.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I would suggest waiting until the child is 12 years old and their body is fully grown before giving it." These words go against what most doctors agree on. Doctors say the best way to stop Hepatitis B from passing from mother to baby is to give the vaccine within 24 hours of birth. This helps prevent future liver damage and liver cancer.</p>
            <p>Trump's government also shared today some very debated ideas about what causes autism. At the same time, they are promoting research to find possible "cures."</p>
            <p>Trump claimed that pregnant women should not take Tylenol, an over-the-counter painkiller. He said its main ingredient, acetaminophen, might be linked to a risk of autism in children. Scientists around the world strongly disagree with this claim. It also goes against what studies have found.</p>
            <p>Speaking at the White House with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump said, "Not everything is 100% understood or known, but I believe we have made a lot of progress."</p>
            <p>He clearly stated, "Taking Tylenol is not good... All pregnant women should talk to their doctors about using this medicine less during pregnancy." Trump later said again, "Do not take Tylenol. There is no harm in not doing so."</p>
            <p>Also, the government will study using leucovorin as a possible treatment for autism. Leucovorin is currently used to treat cancer and anemia.</p>
            <p>A report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that in 2022, 1 out of every 31 8-year-old children in the U.S. was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Symptoms include problems with social communication and interaction, and repeated behaviors. In 2000, the data showed that 1 out of every 150 children in the U.S. had autism.</p>
            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blamed the increase in autism cases on "environmental toxins." He called autism "a complex disease with many causes." He has also often said that the rise in autism is linked to vaccinations.</p>
            <p>However, experts believe that the rise in autism is mainly because screening is more common now, and the rules for diagnosis have changed. They also say that what causes autism is largely connected to genes.</p>
