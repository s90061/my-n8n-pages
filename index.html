            <h1>True Yoga Fitness Closes Due to Bankruptcy; Lawmakers Call for Investigation into Possible Illegal Acts</h1>
            <p>True Yoga, a fitness company, said on September 30 that it would close on October 1. It will now go through the legal process of closing down and bankruptcy. Several lawmakers and local council members held a press conference today. They said that the legal person in charge of True Yoga left Taiwan in January 2020 and has not returned. They asked if the person ran away without caring about customers. They also asked the government to quickly check if illegal things happened.</p>
            <p>Members of Parliament Fan Yun and Wang Hui, along with city council members Ho Meng-hua, Miao Po-ya, Chang Wei-chien, and Huang Chiung-hui, held a press conference today in the Parliament building. The press conference was titled, "True Yoga suddenly closed! Who will protect the rights of tens of thousands of victims?"</p>
            <p>True Yoga Fitness, which has many branches across Taiwan, suddenly announced it was closing. Tens of thousands of members and trainers are affected. A group for victims to help each other quickly grew to over 3,500 people.</p>
            <p>Fan Yun said that True Yoga was the biggest chain of yoga centers in Taiwan. Now it has suddenly decided to close. It is hard for members to get back their prepaid yearly fees and class money. Also, many trainers and employees were fired, and they are owed wages. Many companies that worked with True Yoga are also owed money. This situation reminds people of the bad closing of Alexander fitness centers. This shows that it is not just one problem with customers. It is a bigger problem with how the fitness industry is watched and how consumers are protected. The government should help immediately. It should make sure that money is returned as promised. It should also plan how to give legal help to victims and deal with problems between workers and the company. This will protect the rights of tens of thousands of victims.</p>
            <p>Ho Meng-hua said that by law, there is only NT$210 million in a special trust account. However, customers may be owed more than NT$420 million. Other companies that are owed money can only get 50% of what they are owed. The True Yoga management team is not meeting with anyone. Even the email address for refunds does not work. The government should check all rules for "prepaid transactions" to protect customers. This will stop customers from being victims again and again.</p>
            <p>Huang Chiung-hui also said that the consumer protection officer in Taoyuan City should take action. She also asked the Labor Bureau to handle problems between True Yoga and its workers. This will protect the basic rights of the workers. A company that was owed money said that True Yoga refused to pay more than NT$2 million for construction work. True Yoga reportedly said, "Go ahead and sue us, many companies are already suing us anyway."</p>
            <p>Miao Po-ya said that there are over 40,000 members. The guarantee account only has over NT$200 million left. This means each member might only get back about NT$5,000. Many customers are worried about this. The Taipei City Government should act more quickly. If they wait for consumer groups to file a group lawsuit, True Yoga could sell off its assets. So, it is important to save any assets that can be turned into money first. This is most important for the members.</p>
            <p>Liang Ming-chen, a consumer protection officer from the Executive Yuan's Consumer Protection Department, said that his department will quickly contact the Financial Supervisory Commission and banks about credit card dispute claims and money in the trust account. Right now, they can focus on credit card refunds. By current rules, if a purchase was made within 540 days, and the company stopped services within 120 days, people can ask their banks for a refund. The Consumer Protection Department will hold a meeting next week with relevant government offices to discuss this.</p>
            <p>Liu Tzu-chun, Deputy Director of the Department of Sports Industry, said that if a group lawsuit is filed, the Sports Department will help. They will check for any problems in the current rules for fitness companies and make them better.</p>
            <p>Chin Shih-ping, section chief of the Labor Relations Department at the Ministry of Labor, said that about 100 workers have already asked for help. He urged other employees who have not yet asked the Labor Bureau for help to do so quickly. He also hopes True Yoga will quickly pay the wages it owes. If it does not, local governments will report it to the Ministry of Labor, and the law will be followed.</p>
