            <h1>Wu Derong: High Temperatures Everywhere, 50% Chance of Tropical System Becoming a Typhoon</h1>
            <p>Weather expert Wu Derong said that many places today will still be hot. Around noon, people should be careful because UV radiation will be at a dangerous level. This week, there is a 50% chance that a tropical weather system will form into a typhoon far to the east of Taiwan. It is expected to move past Ryukyu and head towards Japan, but people still need to watch it closely.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong, who is also an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his "Secrets of Heaven Classroom" column today. He said that the newest computer models from Europe show that a tropical weather system will be active far to the east of Taiwan this week. There is about a 50% chance it will become a typhoon. The average path from these models shows it moving north, passing near Ryukyu, and then turning sharply northeast, which could affect Japan. However, individual model paths are spread out, meaning we are not sure exactly where it will go. We should keep watching it.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong also said that the latest European models show sunny to cloudy weather in many places today. It will be very hot. Around noon, the UV index will be dangerous, so people should protect their skin from the sun and avoid heatstroke. In the afternoon, there might be some rain or thunderstorms in the mountains.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration today issued a warning for high temperatures. It will be hot everywhere. Taipei City, New Taipei City, and Changhua County have an orange warning, which means there is a chance of temperatures reaching 36 degrees Celsius for several days in a row.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong added that the newest European models show that from tomorrow until September 3rd, there will be a little more moisture from the south. Many places will be cloudy but sunny at times, and northern Taiwan will still be warm. The eastern part of Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula might have short periods of rain sometimes. In the afternoon, there will be local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains. Sometimes, these storms might spread to some flat areas. People should be careful about heavy thunderstorms in some places.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong said that on September 4th and 5th, it will be sunny and very hot everywhere. Temperatures in northern Taiwan could reach 38 degrees Celsius. Around noon, UV radiation will be dangerous, so people must protect themselves from the sun and avoid heatstroke. In the afternoon, there is a chance of local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains.</p>
            <p>Also, Wu Derong stated that on September 6th, there will be a little more moisture from the south. Many places will be cloudy but sunny at times, and northern Taiwan will still be warm. The eastern part of Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula might have short periods of rain sometimes. In the afternoon, there will be local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains, and sometimes these might spread to some flat areas.</p>

            <h1>Nicaraguan Dissidents Die in Prison One After Another; Opposition Accuses Authorities of Suppression</h1>
            <p>(Managua, August 30th) News from Nicaragua and opposition groups today says that a person who disagreed with the government died in prison two weeks after being arrested. Also, earlier this week, another person who had long been against the government also died while in prison.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that these deaths show that President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, continue to strongly stop people who disagree with them. In recent years, they have arrested hundreds of people from the opposition. Since 2019, it is said that five people who opposed the government have died in prison.</p>
            <p>The opposition person reported to have died today was lawyer Carlos Cardenas. He was arrested on August 15th during a police raid against people who oppose the government. Cardenas was also put in prison in 2018 because of large protests in Nicaragua. Reuters could not talk directly to Cardenas's family.</p>
            <p>The Grand Opposition Alliance of Nicaragua (GCON) posted on X today, saying: "This strict government has given the body of another political prisoner back to their family."</p>
            <p>The Nicaraguan government has not yet answered requests for comments on this matter.</p>
            <p>On August 25th, many opposition leaders in Nicaragua also spoke out against the authorities. They did this because political activist Mauricio Alonso died in prison after being arrested in mid-July.</p>

            <h1>Vilnius Electric Boats: Pride of a Green Capital or Waste of Taxpayers' Money?</h1>
            <p>In the middle of July, the first electric boat in Lithuania started to sail. Mayor Valdas Benkunskas was there to see it. The boat travels on the Neris River, which goes through the city center. The city government said these boats are not just for regular transport; they are also an important symbol to encourage "river life." But when the electric boats started, people praised them and also questioned them at almost the same time.</p>
            <p>The city government plans to use four electric boats this year. Each boat costs about 450,000 Euros (about 15.75 million Taiwan Dollars). If you add the cost of building docks and hiring staff, the first investment is expected to be more than 2 million Euros. One trip on an electric boat takes about 30 to 50 minutes. Each boat only has 34 seats. On average, they expect 390 passengers per day. Also, the boats only run from May to October.</p>
            <p>These numbers quickly caused arguments. For people who support the boats, electric boats show Vilnius's dream of being a green city. They make the city's river not just a pretty view but also a part of daily life. But for those who criticize them, the small number of passengers they can carry and the limited time they run each year make this big investment look more like an expensive show, especially when compared to buses or trams.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of August, heavy rain caused the company running the boats, JUDU, to suddenly stop them. The official reason was not just that the water level rose. It was because the heavy rain washed many tree branches and logs into the river, which made it unsafe. However, people still made fun of this. People wondered: If a summer rain can stop the boats, how can they talk about stable service?</p>
            <p>Soon after, another passenger complained. He was not allowed to get on an electric boat because it was full. He then walked and arrived at the next stop faster than the boat. This made the mayor's words about "regular public transport" seem not true at all.</p>
            <p>Taking advantage of the clear weather at the end of summer, a reporter also rode on this new transport, which has received a lot of attention this year. The boat was full of people trying it for the first time out of curiosity. More often, it was young people and families taking pictures for social media, not people going to work.</p>
            <p>A couple with bicycles told the reporter that the river path is winding, and the boats do not come very often. Also, there are only five stops. So, it is hard for them to replace buses, even during busy times. They think electric boats are better for fun or for tourists, not for daily travel.</p>
            <p>Another Lithuanian passenger complained because he almost could not get on the boat. He was waiting at a middle stop and was told he could not get on because the boat already had 34 people and no one was getting off. In the end, he had to ask the crew for help to get on. To him, the electric boats are not a useful way for people to travel. Instead, they are a "useless investment" that politicians pushed for to look good.</p>
            <p>The criticism did not just come from passengers. City council member Aleksandras Nemunaitis said directly that electric boats are "certain to lose money" because they can only run for part of the year and carry few people. He said he "would not be surprised at all" if they stopped running in two years when a new political party takes power.</p>
            <p>The city government, however, says this is an investment in a green future. They say the boat routes not only offer transport but also help people feel more connected to the river. Go Vilnius, the official tourism group, even called the electric boats "both a symbol of moving towards a green city and a practical step."</p>
            <p>It is true that quietly sailing on the Neris River in a boat without diesel smoke or loud engine noise is a pleasant experience. Looking at the green views along both sides of the river helps people forget their daily worries for a while. This is probably the most attractive thing about the electric boats.</p>
            <p>But when the title of "Green Capital" is no longer new, will Vilnius still be able to convince its people that this investment is worth it? Will the electric boats become a symbol of the city's long-term growth, or just a short-lived political decoration? Only time will tell the answer to this question.</p>
