            <h1>Green Party Says Taichung Mayor Left Biggest Trash Pile; City Says Landfill Not Full</h1>
            <p>Some news recently said that the Dali landfill in Taichung was full and causing problems for residents. A spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Cho Kuan-ting, said today that Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen has been hiding and, after eight years in office, has left Taiwan's largest pile of trash.</p>
            <p>However, the Taichung Environmental Protection Bureau replied that the landfill follows environmental rules and is not full. They also said that once the garbage incinerators finish their yearly repairs, the trash can be moved back to be burned.</p>
            <p>DPP spokespersons Wu Cheng and Cho Kuan-ting held a press conference this morning. Cho Kuan-ting stated that it has been seven days since the news on September 1st reported that the Dali landfill was full. He added that Mayor Lu Shiow-yen has been avoiding the issue and has not responded.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting explained that before the previous Taichung Mayor Lin Chia-lung left office, the Dali landfill had only 7,000 tons of trash. In 2019, when Lu Shiow-yen started her term, the amount reached 37,000 tons. This year, it has grown to 340,000 tons, which is 40% of all the open-air trash in Taiwan's 22 cities and counties.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting also pointed out that back in 2018, when Lin Chia-lung was mayor, a budget of NT$1 billion was set aside to improve the Wenshan Incineration Plant. At that time, the work was expected to be finished by 2021. If Mayor Lu Shiow-yen had continued with this plan, the trash problem could have been solved. However, Lu Shiow-yen changed the previous government's plan, saying she wanted to use a BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) method. This made the project cost much more, increasing to NT$8.5 billion. Now, after her eight years in office, Taichung has Taiwan's largest pile of trash.</p>
            <p>Wu Cheng added that audit reports have warned for years that Taichung's incinerators cannot handle enough trash and that the landfills are also not big enough. All three incinerators in Taichung are old and need to be updated. But because Mayor Lu Shiow-yen kept changing between ROT (Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer) and BOT plans, the Wenshan Incineration Plant only started looking for companies to work with this year. It is expected to be finished by 2032.</p>
            <p>In response, the Taichung Environmental Protection Bureau said that the Dali landfill follows strict environmental rules and is not full. They explained that it is used as a temporary place for trash when the incinerators have their yearly repairs. Once the incinerator repairs are done, the trash from the landfill can be moved back to be burned. This means trash goes "in and out."</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau also stated that they started moving trash from the Dali landfill back to the incinerator storage in 2023. They said that Minister of Environment Peng Chi-ming visited the site and agreed that the management was good. The Dali landfill was not included in the national meeting about exposed trash that needs to be checked.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau mentioned that to deal with household trash faster, they are not only improving incinerators to burn more trash but also temporarily taking it to landfills. To follow environmental rules, they cover the trash with recycled materials from burned waste or use nets to stop it from spreading. This ensures that the surrounding environment remains clean and safe.</p>

            <h1>3-Story House Collapses During Demolition in New Taipei's Luzhou, Crushing Scaffolding, No Injuries</h1>
            <p>A three-story house in an alley on Guanghua Road, Luzhou District, New Taipei City, was being torn down. Unexpectedly, around 10 AM today, the third-floor ceiling suddenly fell. This caused dust and dirt to spread everywhere and crushed the scaffolding and power lines.</p>
            <p>Luckily, no one was hurt or trapped when it happened. The police have been told to send people to check the exact reason for the collapse.</p>
            <p>The Luzhou police station in New Taipei sent a message explaining what happened. This morning around 10 AM, a three-story house being taken down suddenly had its floor collapse. Quickly, dirt and dust filled the air, and the scaffolding and electric wires were broken.</p>
            <p>The police said that after they were told, they sent officers to block off the area to keep it safe. They checked with the construction workers and confirmed that no one was trapped or injured. The head of the Luzhou District Office, Zhong Yao-lei, also came to see what happened. He then told the Public Works Bureau to send staff to the site to check the situation. This will help them find out why the collapse happened and what to do next.</p>
