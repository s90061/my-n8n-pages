            <h1>Typhoons and Heavy Rains in July and August: Chen Chi-mai Says to Improve Recovery in Indigenous Areas</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai said today in a city meeting that three indigenous areas were badly damaged by heavy rains. He told relevant government departments and local offices to actively help with rebuilding and recovery. He also asked them to remind house owners to put in fire alarms by themselves.</p>
            <p>During the city meeting, Chen Chi-mai listened to a special report from the Council of Indigenous Peoples about disaster relief after typhoons and heavy rains in July and August. The report showed the current recovery situation in the three indigenous areas of Maolin, Taoyuan, and Namasia, which were affected by the heavy rains.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai said that the indigenous areas were badly damaged by heavy rains. He asked the relevant departments and local offices to actively help these three areas rebuild and recover.</p>
            <p>Also, as the new school year is starting soon, Chen Chi-mai reminded the Education Bureau to make sure schools clean their environments, manage traffic routes for students, and check public health and lunch safety. He also asked them to make sure all schools do these tasks well. He also said that the public vote on August 23 should be well prepared, and the police department should keep public order.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Chen Chi-mai pointed out that the Kaohsiung City Government changed and released the "Kaohsiung City Fire Prevention Self-Governing Regulations" in August last year. This rule says that for houses that do not need to have automatic fire alarm systems, the person in charge must install "residential fire alarms." If they do not fix it after being told to, they will be fined.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai said that these new rules will start on September 1st this year. He asked the Fire Department, Public Works Bureau, and Civil Affairs Bureau to tell people more about it. They need to remind owners of townhouses and apartments to think about putting in fire alarms themselves.</p>

            <h1>Over 20,000 People Moved: "Tears of the Fire God" Musical Adds More Shows</h1>
            <p>The musical "Tears of the Fire God" tells stories about firefighters' families, friendships, and work relationships. Since it first started, over 20,000 people have watched it and were very moved, often crying. Story Works and Fun Music Works have announced that they will have more shows in Taipei and Chiayi.</p>
            <p>Story Works released a press statement today saying that the musical "Tears of the Fire God" was adapted, directed, and written by Artistic Director Huang Chih-kai. Wang Hsi-wen, who often wins Golden Horse Awards, is the music director and composer. The actors include Yang Ta-cheng, Fang You-hsin, Wang Wei, Chou Chia-kuan, Luo Mei-ling, Shih Yuan-chieh, and 23 other talented musical actors. They perform with great energy on stage, using music and drama to create a story full of passion and tears.</p>
            <p>Lead actor Yang Ta-cheng said he planned to stop performing in theater for a while, but this play moved him. He felt it would be very important to help finish this play. Fang You-hsin also said that during practice, she deeply respected the firefighters' spirit of "always going forward and not expecting anything in return." She said, "In the play, I have to use a ladder truck to rescue people, but I am actually afraid of heights. However, I believe there is a life waiting, so my personal fear seems very small."</p>
            <p>The musical "Tears of the Fire God" will be performed from August 22 to 24 at the Taipei Performing Arts Center and on September 6 at the Chiayi Performing Arts Center.</p>

            <h1>Thailand Builds Buddhist Temple Similar to Angkor Wat; Cambodia Calls it Cultural Theft</h1>
            <p>Before border fighting started between Thailand and Cambodia in late July this year, the two countries argued about a Buddhist temple being built in Thailand. This temple looks very much like Angkor Wat, a World Heritage site in Cambodia, leading to accusations of copying.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Asia reported that Wat Phu Man Fah, located in Buriram Province, Thailand, covers about 3 hectares. It is built with sandstone bricks. Everything from the sculptures of the mythical snake god "Naga," the carvings on the walls, to the walkways around the main hall, looks very similar to Angkor Wat.</p>
            <p>Angkor Wat was built in the 12th century and is a symbol of the Khmer Empire, which was once powerful in Southeast Asia. It is highly valued by the Khmer people of Cambodia and even appears on Cambodia's national flag.</p>
            <p>Thailand and Cambodia had conflicts over land in May, and their relationship quickly got worse. People in both countries started to have more negative feelings about each other, and the argument about Wat Phu Man Fah grew stronger. For Cambodia, this temple looks like a challenge from Thailand.</p>
            <p>At a meeting of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in July, Cambodian Minister of Culture and Fine Arts Phoeurng Sackona said that the Wat Phu Man Fah building plan was a clear act of cultural theft and an immoral copy. She also warned that such actions would set a bad example that could make World Heritage sites less valuable.</p>
            <p>The Thai government said that Wat Phu Man Fah does not copy Angkor Wat. They said the temple was built according to Thai old buildings and traditions, and they do not want to make the problems between the two countries worse.</p>
            <p>Thailand was greatly influenced by the Khmer Empire and has many old buildings in the Khmer style. Some of these buildings are near the border between Thailand and Cambodia, which can easily cause arguments between the two countries about who owns the culture.</p>
            <p>As the argument about Wat Phu Man Fah continued, many more visitors came to see it.</p>
            <p>A woman in her 50s who lives and works near Wat Phu Man Fah said that the temple used to have few visitors. But recently, thousands of tourists visit on weekends, and many come because of national pride.</p>
            <p>The head monk of Wat Phu Man Fah showed his concern. He said that the temple was built to help people have more faith. "I am happy that more people come, but this should not become a tool for political arguments."</p>
