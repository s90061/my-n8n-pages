            <h1>News from Reuters: OPEC+ Plans to Increase Oil Production in November</h1>
            <p>Reuters news agency, quoting sources, reported that the group of oil-producing countries and their allies, called OPEC+, might agree to produce more oil again in November. This comes after they already agreed to increase production earlier this month. They plan to add at least 137,000 barrels of oil per day.</p>
            <p>Sources said that eight main countries in OPEC+ will have a video meeting on October 5th. In this meeting, they will decide how much oil to produce in November.</p>
            <p>OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed to increase oil production earlier this month. This new plan started more than a year earlier than they first expected.</p>
            <p>The OPEC main office and related departments in Saudi Arabia have not yet answered Reuters' questions about this news.</p>

            <h1>Over Ten Thousand "Shovel Superheroes" Help Clean Hualien Guangfu; President Orders More Military Support</h1>
            <p>The overflow from the Mata'an Creek landslide lake in Hualien has badly damaged Guangfu Township. Volunteers, called "Shovel Superheroes," have come from all over to help clean up the disaster area. They have become a beautiful sight there. Today, President Lai Ching-te also ordered more soldiers from the national army to help with the recovery work. So far, about 2,500 soldiers have joined the effort.</p>
            <p>On September 23rd, the Mata'an Creek landslide lake in Hualien overflowed. The strong water broke the Mata'an Creek Bridge. It also flowed over the riverbanks and into villages and roads in Guangfu Township. At its worst, the water was almost one story high. Cars were flooded or washed away, and many people were trapped for a while. At least 17 people have died, 7 are still missing, and 100 are injured. The area is still under a red alert.</p>
            <p>Looking back at this serious disaster, Chief Wang Tzu-an of Dama Village in Guangfu Township did a great job evacuating people, and no one in the village was hurt. Guangfu Township Chief Lin Chin-shui said that in the future, they will check on all homes that need special care. This is to make sure that old people and those who need more help get warnings and are moved to safety, so a sad event like this does not happen again.</p>
            <p><b>More Than 500 People Are Still in Shelters; County Government Sets Up Supply Stations</b></p>
            <p>Today, the Hualien County Government held a meeting to talk about the progress of the disaster relief after the Mata'an Creek landslide lake broke. Chen Chien-tsun, the head of the Administration and Research Department, explained that 547 people are staying in shelters. 223 people are at Dajin Elementary School, 53 at Daquan Township Nursery, and 271 at Huye Hot Spring Hotel.</p>
            <p>The county government said that 341 homes do not have water right now. 4,378 homes once had no water, and 92.21% of them now have water again. The 9th District Office of the Water Company will provide 20 mobile water supply vehicles. Also, 21 water stations will be set up in Guangfu Township. You can find more information on the "Hualien County Government Mata'an Creek Landslide Lake Information Area" website.</p>
            <p>The county government also stated that helpful supplies include drinking water, food, baby and adult milk powder, baby and adult diapers, cold medicine, basic first aid items, clothes, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, and slippers. The actual items will depend on what is available at the site. The "Hualien County Government Supply Receiving and Distribution Station" is located behind the parking lot at No. 19, Tangchang Street, Guangfu Township. For large amounts of supplies, please go to the large warehouse behind the same location to register and pick them up.</p>
            <p>After the disaster, people faced sudden changes in their lives and emotional stress. The Hualien County Health Bureau set up caring stations. As of September 27th, they had helped people 217 times. This includes 199 people at the Dajin Elementary School caring station and 18 people at the Ruisui Life Park caring station.</p>
            <p>People are also worried about the education rights of students at Guangfu Junior High School. The Education Department explained the current cleaning and recovery situation at the school. As of 10 AM today, offices and classrooms on the first floor of the teaching building are still being cleaned. The ground from the side gate to the basketball court has been cleared of mud. The road from the main gate to the teaching building is now open. Half of the path from the school gate to the teaching building, activity center, and dormitories has been cleared. The football field is 1/5 finished. They have also contacted a company to set up 8 portable toilets.</p>
            <p><b>Misinformation and False Alarms Cause Two Disturbances in Guangfu Disaster Area in One Day</b></p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center said today that the area is still on red alert. In the future, warnings and evacuations will be given like tsunami alarms.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, a rumor spread in Guangfu Township that a dam had broken, causing panic in the town. The 9th River Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Water Resources Agency explained that engineers are trying to divert the river to other places. They believe this will not cause danger and ask people not to panic.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center also clarified that no large amount of lake water was flowing down or that any collapse happened. If anything unusual happens, a tsunami air-raid alarm will be used to warn people.</p>
            <p>The Eastern Branch of the Coast Guard Administration said that at that time, engineers were trying to divert the river. However, this was misunderstood. Fire department vehicles in the disaster area first turned on their alarms to warn people to be safe. Coast Guard vehicles also turned on their warning lights for safety reasons, meaning to remind people passing by to be careful. They wanted to make this clear.</p>
            <p>Then, in the afternoon, there was a false alarm at the Hualien County Police Bureau. The police explained in a news release that a police officer from the county police bureau, who was on duty at the Central Emergency Operation Center coordination office, misunderstood the commander's instructions during a meeting. The officer thought that "if floodwaters reach a red alert, a notification must be sent immediately" meant that a tsunami alarm should be issued right away.</p>
            <p>The county police bureau said that the officer then, based on information from the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau showing a red alert, told the county police bureau to have the Changqiao Police Station of the Fenglin Branch and the Guangfu Police Station issue a tsunami alarm and help people evacuate. However, according to rules, the county police bureau can only issue a tsunami alarm after being notified by the Forestry Bureau. The officer gave the wrong information without checking first, which caused people to panic.</p>
            <p>The county police bureau said that they will review this mistake and hold the responsible people accountable according to the rules.</p>
            <p><b>Government Increases Aid and Aims for Livable Conditions in 14 Days</b></p>
            <p>The floods from the Mata'an Creek landslide lake in Hualien have caused a lot of damage. Premier Cho Jung-tai visited the Guangfu Township disaster area today. He announced that the aid money for each person who died will increase from NT$800,000 to NT$1,000,000. People who are seriously injured will get NT$250,000. If a house is filled with mud, each household will receive NT$100,000 in aid.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also said that they will not stop searching for the 7 missing people. The red alert will not be lifted yet. They have started a plan called "Safe Home, Government Pays." He also asked that basic living conditions be restored within 14 days of the disaster.</p>
            <p>The President said today that to help the disaster victims return to normal life quickly, he called Minister of National Defense Gu Li-hsiung this morning. He ordered more soldiers from the national army to help with the recovery work after the disaster. Currently, nearly 2,500 soldiers have already joined to help. It is expected that around the same number of soldiers will take turns helping on September 30th. They hope to finish cleaning up the Guangfu Township disaster area before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
            <p>The Army Headquarters announced this evening that to help the people in the Hualien disaster area rebuild their homes faster, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th combat areas are still working hard on rescue efforts. They have sent about 2,500 soldiers, UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, drones, and 17 types of equipment (357 pieces in total) to help with the recovery. They aim to finish the recovery work as quickly and effectively as possible, showing the Army's strong will to protect the public.</p>
            <p><b>Ministry of Transportation Provides Daily Shuttle Buses to Help "Shovel Superheroes" Reach Disaster Area</b></p>
            <p>The overflow from the Mata'an Creek landslide lake has caused floods, and "Shovel Superheroes" from all over are helping to clear the mud. Yesterday, there were over 10,000 people, and today, even more are expected. To speed up the rescue work and ensure smooth aid, traffic control in Guangfu Township has been changed starting today. The county government asks people to clear the roads for rescue vehicles first.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau said today that starting now, they will provide 6 large buses daily from Xincheng, Hualien, Ji'an, Shoufeng, and Yuli stations. These buses will take volunteers to the damaged areas. Minister of Transportation Chen Shih-kai also visited Hualien again today to check on things.</p>
            <p>People from various places have voluntarily joined as "Shovel Superheroes" in Guangfu Township, bringing new strength to the post-disaster cleanup and rebuilding. Premier Cho Jung-tai expressed thanks to so many volunteers, saying that their help shows the strong connection among Taiwanese people, which is important for the world to see. He also stressed the need to take good care of the volunteers and match them with tasks.</p>
            <p>For coordinating volunteers, the Hualien County Government has released a "Post-Disaster Recovery Volunteer Recruitment Form" (link provided). The form can be filled out from September 28th to October 2nd. People can also call the volunteer matching hotline at 0975-769035, which is available 24 hours a day. For inquiries at Guangfu Station, volunteers can call 0972-223409 or 0972-223410.</p>

            <h1>Asian Baseball Championship: Taiwan Loses to Japan 0-11, Finishes Second Place Again</h1>
            <p>In the Asian Baseball Championship final today, Taiwan played against Japan again. Taiwan's pitchers could not stop Japan's hitters. In the end, Taiwan lost 0-11. This means Taiwan finished second place for the second time in a row. Japan won its 21st Asian Championship title. The top three teams from the Asian Championship will get to play in next year's U23 World Cup.</p>
            <p>The Asian Baseball Championship was held in Pingtan, China. Taiwan's team has played against Japan in the final four times in a row. Today, Taiwan started with pitcher Lin Sheng-en, who plays for the Cincinnati Reds system in the US. Lin Sheng-en had trouble from the start.

            <p>Lin Sheng-en did not finish the first inning. He left the game after one out with runners on base. Chen Mu-heng, a pitcher from Japan's Orix Buffaloes team, came in to pitch. He got the second out with a strikeout. Then, he gave up two walks in a row, and Japan scored another run.</p>
            <p>Chen Mu-heng continued pitching in the second inning. The first two batters hit singles against him. Then, Japan scored a run with a sacrifice fly. He then gave up a walk and a hit, and he left the game. Taiwan's third pitcher, Gao Wei-qiang, came in. Mizutani Shohei hit a single against him, and Japan scored. Then, Japan scored another run with a sacrifice fly.</p>
            <p>Gao Wei-qiang had problems in the fourth inning. He first gave up a walk. After two outs, Japan hit a single and scored another run. In the fifth inning, Taiwan put Li Zhi-lin on the mound, and he got three outs without anyone reaching base. In the sixth inning, after two outs, he gave up a walk and a hit. Japan scored one run because of a wild pitch, but the situation did not get worse.</p>
            <p>Li Zhi-lin continued pitching in the seventh inning. The first batter got on base due to an error. Then, Kumada Naohiro hit a single, and Li Zhi-lin left the game. Wang Yu-jie took over pitching. After two outs, Aizawa Ryosuke hit a single, and Japan scored two more runs.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team had 6 hits in total today. Pan Chun-yu, batting second, had 3 hits in the game. However, Taiwan's offense could not connect their hits and did not score any runs, leading to the loss.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team lost to Japan and finished second place for the second time in a row. Japan won its 21st championship title, completing consecutive wins. The top three teams in the Asian Championshipâ€”Japan, Taiwan, and South Koreaâ€”will get tickets to the U23 Baseball World Cup next year.</p>
