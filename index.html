U.S. President Donald Trump announced on July 7 that starting August 1, the United States will put a 25% tax on products coming from Japan and South Korea. If these products are sent through other countries to avoid the tax, they will face even higher taxes. Also, if Japan or South Korea decide to raise their taxes on American goods, the U.S. will add that same amount to its 25% tax on their products.

In April, Trump had planned to put a 10% tax on most imported goods. He also planned higher taxes for some economies, like 24% for Japan and 26% for South Korea. However, he paused these plans to allow for talks. This pause ends on July 9. If countries do not reach an agreement with the U.S. by then, they will start to face these higher taxes.

Trump sent letters to Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung. The letters said that the U.S. needs to fix its trade issues with Japan and South Korea. For a long time, the U.S. has bought more goods from these countries than they have bought from the U.S., which is not a fair trade. He also said that if Japan or South Korea choose to build factories or make products in the U.S., they will not be taxed. He promised that these kinds of investments would be approved quickly. Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba said on television that Japan is "ready for anything" regarding Trump's tax letters. South Korea's trade minister met with a U.S. trade official to discuss extending the delay for the tariffs.

**Trump: 25% Tariffs on Japanese and Korean Imports Start August 1**

U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media on July 7 that he will put a 25% tax on goods coming from Japan and South Korea. These are the first letters Trump sent to trade partners before a July 9 deadline to make trade deals in Washington.

According to Agence France-Presse, Trump's letters to the leaders of Japan and South Korea stated that the taxes will start on August 1. He explained that the trade relationship between Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. has "sadly been far from equal." The words in both letters were almost the same.

Bloomberg News also reported that Trump warned Japan and South Korea in the letters not to take revenge. If they do, the U.S. will punish them even more. Trump's letters said: "If for any reason you decide to raise your tariffs, then whatever numbers you choose, those numbers will be added on top of the 25% we are collecting."
