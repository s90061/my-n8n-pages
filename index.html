            <h1>American Man Loses Wallet, Taipei Police Help Find It in 1 Hour Before He Goes Home</h1>
            <p>A 22-year-old American man lost his wallet recently while riding the Taipei Metro. He was going back to the United States soon and needed his important documents. The Taipei City MRT Police helped him find it quickly, in about one hour after he told them it was lost.</p>
            <p>The MRT Police shared this news today. In mid-June, an American man told them he lost his wallet. He said that the day before, he rode the MRT from Taipei 101/World Trade Center Station to Gongguan Station. But he only realized his black wallet was gone the next day. Inside were about NT$5000, credit cards, his student ID, and other important papers.</p>
            <p>Because he needed to go back home soon, he really needed to find his documents. A police officer named Yuan Zhihong from the MRT Police team checked the information the man gave. Then, he immediately told the staff at Taipei 101/World Trade Center Station to look for the wallet. He also contacted other stations along the MRT line to ask if anyone had found a similar wallet.</p>
            <p>After talking to many people, the police learned that someone found a wallet at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Station. It was the same as the one the American man lost. They thought the man probably lost his wallet when he changed from the Tamsui-Xinyi Line to the Songshan-Xindian Line at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Station.</p>
            <p>The MRT police then went with the American man to the information desk at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Station. They checked that everything inside the wallet was still there. Then, they helped him get his wallet back. It took only about one hour from the time the man reported it until the police helped him find his wallet.</p>
            <p>The American man smiled and thanked the police in Taiwan. He was happy that everything in his wallet was still there. He said the police were very good at their job and very fast.</p>
            <p>The MRT Police want to remind everyone to always keep an eye on their things when riding the MRT. This helps to avoid losing them. When you change trains, there are often many people. If you lose something, do not be worried. You should immediately tell the station staff, security guards, or the MRT police. You can also call 110 to report it. The MRT police will come to help you right away.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Dance Hall Workers Sentenced for Selling Drugs, 5 Get Up to 4 Years and 4 Months in Prison</h1>
            <p>People who worked at the Grand Empire Dance Hall in Kaohsiung were selling drugs to customers or other workers. Ten people, including the manager and assistant manager of the dance hall, were charged with this crime. After a trial at Qiaotou District Court, five people, including a woman named Ms. Xiao, were sentenced to prison. Their sentences are from 1 year and 11 months to 4 years and 4 months. They were found guilty of breaking laws about drugs. The court's decision can still be appealed to a higher court.</p>
            <p>The Qiaotou District Court said in its ruling that all the drug sales were done for money. Ms. Xiao and the other four people admitted that they did it to earn money from the difference in buying and selling prices or the amount of drugs. The judge thought that the five people admitted what they did during the police investigation and court process. They also helped the police find where other drugs came from. The judge believed that they showed good behavior after the crime. The judge considered how much drug they sold, how much money they made, what kind of drugs they sold, who they sold to, and how they sold them. Based on these things, Ms. Xiao and the other four people were sentenced for selling Class 3 drugs or trying to sell Class 3 drugs. Their prison sentences are between 1 year and 11 months and 4 years and 4 months.</p>
            <p>This case started in 2023. The Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office told the police to search the Grand Empire Dance Hall in Kaohsiung one morning. The police found that people working at the dance hall were selling a Class 3 drug called ketamine to customers in some private rooms. They also let customers use drugs in the rooms. Some of the public relations staff even used drugs with the customers.</p>
            <p>At the dance hall, the police found and took 18 packs of ketamine and 109 packs of drug coffee, along with other evidence, from private rooms and staff lockers. Later, after the investigation by the Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office, 10 people, including the manager and assistant manager of the dance hall, were charged with crimes related to drugs. The Kaohsiung City Government also ordered the dance hall to close because it broke the drug control laws.</p>
