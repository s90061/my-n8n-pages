Many people today spend a lot of time on their phones and computers. This constant use, with endless notifications and social media, can sometimes make us feel tired or stressed. Experts say that too much screen time can even affect our sleep and make us compare ourselves to others, which isn't good for our minds.

However, taking a break from digital devices, also known as a "digital detox," can be very helpful. When people reduce their screen time, they often report sleeping better and feeling more focused. They might also have more time for real-life activities, like spending time with friends and family, reading a book, or enjoying nature. This can lead to less anxiety and a greater sense of peace.

To try a digital detox, you don't have to stop using screens completely. Small changes can make a big difference. For example, you can turn off notifications for certain apps, avoid screens before bed, or set aside specific times each day when you don't use your phone. These simple steps can help you feel better and connect more with the world around you.

**How AI is Changing Jobs and What Workers Can Do**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how we work. Many companies are now using AI tools to do tasks that used to be done by people. This means that some jobs might change or even disappear, especially those that involve repeated, simple work. However, AI is also creating new types of jobs and making existing jobs more interesting.

Experts believe that people need to learn new skills to be ready for these changes. Skills that are becoming very important include critical thinking (solving problems carefully), creativity (thinking of new ideas), and understanding how to use digital tools well. Also, being able to work with others and understand emotions (emotional intelligence) will be key because these are things AI cannot do.

To prepare for the future, workers should be ready to learn throughout their lives. This could mean taking online courses, getting new certifications, or learning how to use AI tools in their current roles. Governments and companies also have a role in offering training programs to help people adapt. By learning new skills, workers can make sure they stay valuable in a changing job market.

**Dealing with Too Many Tourists: How to Travel Better**
Many beautiful places around the world, especially in Europe, are facing a problem called "overtourism." This means that too many tourists visit at the same time, which can harm the environment, make life difficult for local people, and cause prices to go up. Famous cities like Venice and Amsterdam are struggling with this issue.

When too many people visit, it can lead to crowded streets, damaged historical sites, and too much rubbish. Local residents might feel pushed out of their own neighborhoods. Because of this, many places are now trying to find ways to manage tourism more effectively.

If you want to travel responsibly and help these places, there are several things you can do. Try to visit during the "off-season" (when it's less busy), or choose to explore less famous towns instead of just the main attractions. It's also important to respect local rules and customs, use public transport when possible, and buy from local shops and restaurants to support the community. By making smart choices, tourists can help protect these lovely destinations for everyone.
