            <h1>Chou Chun-mi: Restarting Nuclear Power Plant III Vote Clearly Hurts Pingtung People</h1>
            <p>Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi said today that almost 20 million citizens across Taiwan will decide the future of Nuclear Power Plant III, which is in Hengchun Township, Pingtung. She felt it was unfair because Pingtung has only about 680,000 citizens. She said the public vote to restart Nuclear Power Plant III clearly hurts Pingtung people.</p>
            <p>The vote "Do you agree for Nuclear Power Plant III to keep working after the main government body says it is safe?" will happen on August 23. The Citizen of the Earth Foundation held an event called "No Restart for Nuclear Power Plant III, Pray for Taiwan" at Pingtung Academy tonight. Many groups joined. Chou Chun-mi said that people finally agreed about nuclear power, and the "Nuclear-Free Homeland by 2025" rule became law. But then, two political parties worked together to change the law quickly and roughly.</p>
            <p>She said she cannot accept this kind of unfair treatment or bullying of Pingtung people. Pingtung is a big county for farming and fishing. "If something really bad happens at Nuclear Power Plant III, will anyone dare to eat things from Pingtung? Will anyone still want to visit for tourism?" She asked people to vote "No" in the public vote.</p>
            <p>Legislator Chung Chia-pin, who is from the Democratic Progressive Party and represents Pingtung's first election area, said this public vote is strange. He said it wastes taxpayer money and helps politicians achieve their goals. He believes it was planned to hurt Pingtung people and trap Taiwanese people. He asked everyone to stand firm and vote "No."</p>
            <p>Legislator Hsu Fu-kuei, who is also from the Democratic Progressive Party and represents Pingtung's second election area, said that the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee will visit Nuclear Power Plant III on August 20 to check "its readiness to continue operating." He said this ignores what people want and uses nuclear safety for political reasons, without caring about the feelings of Pingtung and Hengchun Township residents.</p>
            <p>Besides Chung Chia-pin and Hsu Fu-kuei, Pingtung County Council members from the Democratic Progressive Party, such as Liang Yu-tzu, Hung Ming-chiang, and Li Shih-pin, also attended the event. They all shouted with the public, "Pingtung says no to Nuclear Power Plant III vote, Taiwan says no!" and "Protect Pingtung, protect Taiwan, pray for Taiwan!"</p>

            <h1>China Protests After Japanese Officials Visit Yasukuni Shrine</h1>
            <p>Today marks 80 years since Japan surrendered in World War II. Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Shinjiro Koizumi, and others visited Yasukuni Shrine. Liu Jinsong, the head of the Asian Affairs Department at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with Akira Yokochi, the chief minister at the Japanese Embassy in China, to make a strong protest.</p>
            <p>Besides Shinjiro Koizumi, other officials also visited the shrine today. These include Takayuki Kobayashi, a member of the House of Representatives and former Minister for Economic Security, and Koichi Hagiuda, a former Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology who was a key person in the Abe faction.</p>
            <p>The website of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced tonight that Liu Jinsong met with Akira Yokochi today. Liu strongly protested to Japan about its officials visiting Yasukuni Shrine.</p>
            <p>The website of the Chinese Embassy in Japan also published a statement today from an unnamed embassy spokesperson about the Yasukuni Shrine issue.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson said that Japanese politicians bowing down at Yasukuni Shrine again shows that Japan has the wrong attitude towards its history of aggression. This makes Asian neighboring countries and the world even more worried and doubtful about where Japan is headed.</p>
            <p>He said that this year is the "80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." Understanding history correctly is very important for Japan to join the world community again after the war. It is also the basis for Japan to build relationships with nearby countries. And it shows if Japan will truly keep its promise to develop peacefully.</p>
            <p>He stated that the main point of the Yasukuni Shrine issue is whether Japan can truly understand and seriously think about its history of aggression. It's about whether Japan can keep its promises about history. It's also about whether Japan can follow the goals and rules of the United Nations Charter and continue on a path of peaceful development. This is a very important issue about right versus wrong, justice versus evil, and light versus darkness.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson asked Japan to face and think about its history of aggression. He urged Japan to be careful with its words and actions on historical matters, like the Yasukuni Shrine. He also asked Japan to completely separate itself from militarism and keep following the path of peaceful development. He said Japan needs to act in a way that makes Asian neighbors and the world trust it.</p>
            <p>According to Kyodo News today, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba did not visit the shrine. Instead, he privately paid for an offering (tamagushi-ryo) as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
