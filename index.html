            <h1>Republican Party Chairman Chou Ko-chi Sentenced to 3 Years for Bribing Signatures, Arrested and Sent to Prison</h1>
            <p>Chou Ko-chi, the chairman of the Republican Party, was sentenced to three years in prison for giving money to people to sign his petition. This happened when he was trying to run for vice president in 2023. Both the first and second courts found him guilty and gave him a three-year prison sentence and a fine of 2 million NT dollars. Today, the Supreme Court denied his appeal, making the sentence final. The court also told the prosecutors to make sure he does not run away.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office said that they told the police to arrest Chou Ko-chi tonight. He will be sent to prison as the law says.</p>
            <p>According to the first court's decision, Chou Ko-chi and a man named Lan wanted to run together for the 16th president and vice president. In 2023, they asked the Central Election Commission to register them by collecting signatures. After they paid a deposit, the Central Election Commission announced them as candidates who needed signatures for the 16th president and vice president election.</p>
            <p>On October 21 and 22, 2023, Chou Ko-chi held events and set up tables for people to sign. He told his staff to ask people to sign. Besides giving out things like rice wine, toothbrushes, and toothpaste, he also gave 200 NT dollars in cash to more than 20 people who signed.</p>
            <p>The first court found Chou Ko-chi guilty of giving bribes, which is against the President and Vice President Election and Recall Act. They sentenced him to three years in prison and a fine of 2 million NT dollars. He appealed the decision, and the Taiwan High Court heard the appeal. During the appeal, Chou Ko-chi asked to stop the trial and asked for a constitutional review.</p>
            <p>The second court decided that the law about bribing to get signatures in the President and Vice President Election and Recall Act is not against the constitution. They also said that the first court's decision was correct in facts, law, and punishment. So, they denied his appeal and kept the original sentence. He appealed again, but the Supreme Court denied it today, making the case final. The Supreme Court also told the prosecutors to make sure he does not run away.</p>
            <p>Also, Chou Ko-chi is suspected of taking money from the Chinese Communist Party. He used this money to hold events for the Republican Party in Taiwan, to protest, and to promote political unity with China. He is accused of breaking the Anti-Infiltration Act. In June this year, the first court in Taipei sentenced Chou Ko-chi to two years in prison for this. This case is now being heard by the High Court for a second review.</p>
