            <h1>North Korea Tests Two New Air Defense Missiles, Kim Jong Un Watches</h1>
            <p>North Korean state media said today that leader Kim Jong Un watched the test of two "new" anti-aircraft missiles. This happened after North Korea accused South Korea of causing problems at the border.</p>
            <p>According to North Korea's official news agency, KCNA, the tests yesterday showed that these two new missile systems are "very good" at what they do.</p>
            <p>The report did not give many details about the new missiles. It only said that how they work and how they react are based on "special and unique technology." The report also did not say where the tests took place.</p>
            <p>KCNA said, "These tests proved that the technical features of these two types of missiles are very good for destroying different targets in the air."</p>
            <p>South Korea's military said yesterday that on August 19, some North Korean soldiers crossed the highly guarded border between the two Koreas for a short time. South Korea's military fired warning shots. North Korean state media quoted army generals who called this a "planned and intentional act to cause trouble."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Little League to Play US in Williamsport Final; Coach: Our Perfect Plan Will Work</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's young baseball players will play against the US team champion tomorrow in the Williamsport Little League World Series. They are hoping to win the championship, which they haven't won for a long time. Lai Min-nan, the head coach of Taipei's Dongyuan Elementary School team, which represents the Asia-Pacific region, said confidently that they don't need to worry about the opponent. He said that Lin Jin-ze will definitely be the starting pitcher, and two other pitchers are ready to come in later. This is their best plan.</p>
            <p>This year, Taiwan's young players have reached the final game in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, USA. This is a big topic among the 10 teams from different countries and US regions. Everyone is talking about whether Taiwan can win again, having already won 4 games.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan team played very well and excitingly in the International Championship game. With steady pitching and good defense, the Aruba team had many chances to score, but Taiwan's accurate pitching and fielding stopped them from scoring any runs.</p>
            <p>Coach Lai Min-nan of Dongyuan Elementary School has 30 years of experience coaching Little League baseball. His decision to change pitchers in the last inning of the game on August 23 caused some talk.</p>
            <p>After the game, he told reporters that before the game, he told all the players to be ready. He planned for different situations to have two starting pitchers ready. So, Lin Jin-ze was not on the initial list to start. He was ready to pitch at any time if needed, and his arm is fine now. The starting pitcher (Liu Wei-heng) pitched more innings than expected, 5 and 1/3 innings. In the end, they used relief pitcher Chen Qi-sheng, who finished the game and helped them win.</p>
            <p>Lai Min-nan explained that the players had never seen such a big event. In a sudden situation, he put the relief pitcher in early. Having two runners on base made the pressure higher, but he let the pitcher come in to get used to the situation. If he walked a batter, it would not be a big problem because first base was empty. At least, it helped him get used to the field and the situation, and the relief pitcher saved the game in the end.</p>
            <p>About playing against the champion from the 10 US teams, he said, "We don't need to worry about the opponent. Lin Jin-ze is definitely the starting pitcher for the whole pitching plan. Two other pitchers are ready to come in for relief. This is the perfect plan."</p>
            <p>Dongyuan Elementary School has won all 4 of its games. Coach Lai Min-nan's decisions on who to play have also been a topic of discussion. He said that from the game against Mexico to the International Championship, his pitching changes were always under control, and the team played very well. As expected, they gave up fewer runs step by step, and even no earned runs. In today's International Championship game, they only used one pitcher.</p>
