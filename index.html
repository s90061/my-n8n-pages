            <h1>Penghu Environmental Volunteers Gather, Promise Sustainable Environment</h1>
            <p>The Penghu County Environmental Volunteers' big meeting started today at the Multi-Functional Sports Hall. About 300 environmental volunteers from 16 teams came together. They showed their promise to protect the environment. They will keep working to make Penghu a low-carbon island where people can live well for a long time.</p>
            <p>Volunteers from many communities, schools, and water patrol teams across the county joined this event. County Magistrate Chen Kuang-fu, Speaker Chen Yu-jen, Council members Hsu Kuo-cheng, Lu Huang Chun-chin, Su Chen Hsiu-se, and Legislator Yang Yao's assistant, Tuan Hsiang-ling, along with Environmental Protection Bureau Director Tsai Chi-hsien, all came to support them. They thanked the volunteers for their long-term effort and hard work in protecting Penghu's environment.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuang-fu said in his speech that environmental protection is not a quick job. It needs a lot of work and responsibility over time. Penghu wants to build a green and sustainable island. Besides government plans, everyone must help. Environmental volunteers are the strongest support. He asked everyone to continue helping the environment to keep a clean and beautiful home for future generations.</p>
            <p>The event began with an environmental promise from volunteers like Huxi Village Chief Hsin Tien-tse. Then, Chen Kuang-fu and Chen Yu-jen rang a gong to officially start it. The competition included games like "Environmental Smarty Pants," "Recycling King," "Resource Slam Dunk," and "Clean-up Relay Race." These games combined environmental knowledge with hands-on activities. Winners could get a total prize of NT$140,000 and the chance to represent Penghu at the National Environmental Volunteer Contest.</p>
            <p>The Penghu County Environmental Protection Bureau said that protecting the environment and living sustainably are not just words. They need everyone to act every day. They asked people to use fewer things that are used only once, recycle things well, sort trash correctly, and choose products that are made from recycled materials. This way, everyone can work together towards the goal of zero carbon emissions and a sustainable life.</p>

            <h1>China Starts Collecting Value-Added Tax on Interest from National Bonds Again</h1>
            <p>China will start collecting a value-added tax again from August 8 on the interest income from new national bonds, local government bonds, and financial bonds. An expert said that most people who buy bonds are organizations, and very few individuals buy bonds. Also, if individuals meet certain rules, they can still be tax-free. So, this change in policy will mostly not affect individual investors.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported on August 1 that China's Ministry of Finance and State Taxation Administration announced together that starting from August 8 this year (including that day), they will collect value-added tax again on interest income from new national bonds, local government bonds, and financial bonds issued on or after that date.</p>
            <p>According to the announcement, for national bonds, local government bonds, and financial bonds issued before August 8 this year (including parts that are re-issued after August 8), the interest income will continue to be tax-free until the bonds are due.</p>
            <p>Li Xuhong, vice president of the Beijing National Accounting Institute, said that mostly organizations invest in bonds, and very few individuals do. Also, individual investors can be exempt from value-added tax if their monthly interest income is less than RMB 100,000 (about NT$410,000) as small-scale taxpayers. So, this policy change will not affect regular individual investors.</p>
            <p>Li Xuhong explained that this policy change is a way to make things better, based on how the bond market is growing now. It can make the tax burden smaller between different kinds of bonds. This helps the national bond interest rate work better as a base for pricing and helps the bond market and financial market stay healthy and grow.</p>
            <p>Liang Ji, director of the Public Revenue Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences, said that China has issued many bonds already, and the market can take them. New bonds are a small part. Also, bond prices are affected by many things, and tax policy is just one of them. So, the policy change will not affect the market much.</p>
            <p>"Securities Times" (a part of "Brokerage China") quoted Wang Feng, an associate professor at the China Institute of Public Finance at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, who said that this new policy might cause prices of old and new bonds to differ in the short term. In the long term, it might make bond assets less attractive for investment. Organizations that invest might slowly change how they invest their money, moving to other types of investments that have better tax benefits or higher returns.</p>
            <p>According to earlier reports from Chinese media, China will issue national bonds worth 1.3 trillion yuan (about NT$5.8 trillion) this year. </p>
