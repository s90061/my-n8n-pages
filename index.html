The Ministry of Education in Taiwan recently updated its list of recognized universities and higher education institutions in mainland China. The list now includes 154 universities and 191 vocational colleges. For the first time in nearly ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been removed from this list.

The Minister of Education, Cheng English-Yao, said earlier this year that schools connected to China's United Front Work Department are not truly academic but serve special purposes. He believes it is necessary to stop working with them, and Taiwan will no longer recognize their degrees in the future.

The Ministry of Education officially updated the list, taking out Guangzhou Jinan University. The Ministry stated that Jinan University in mainland China has been controlled by the United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic setting, and because learning environments should not have specific political goals, Guangzhou Jinan University was removed from the list.

The Ministry of Education also repeated that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, fair, respectful, and beneficial for both sides. Schools holding exchange events in China must follow Taiwan's policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the event's purpose, organizers, schedule, and information materials. These events should not have political goals or content. Schools should also avoid accepting free trips or helping with China's policies and political messages.

Additionally, the Ministry said that if schools are unsure about event organizers or plans, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for clarification. Taiwan still hopes to help young students from both sides learn from each other and understand more. However, during exchanges, students should be aware of risks and check the background of event organizers to see if there are any political aims.
