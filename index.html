            <h1>Heavy Rains in India Stop Traffic, Gurugram Shuts Down Schools and Offices</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain continues to fall on India's Delhi National Capital Region (NCR). This morning, the Yamuna River's water level went above the danger mark. Many areas are flooded, causing traffic to stop. Gurugram, which is the worst affected area, has closed offices and schools because of the rain.</p>
            <p>Delhi and the areas around it have had almost non-stop heavy rain since September 1st. There is a serious risk of floods. This morning, the Yamuna River's water level rose to 205.75 meters. The warning level is 204.5 meters. If the water goes above this, it is a danger to Delhi. If it reaches 205.33 meters, it is considered very dangerous. If it reaches 206 meters, people must leave their homes.</p>
            <p>The Hindustan Times reported that it rained heavily all day on September 1st in Delhi and parts of the NCR. The floods caused very bad traffic jams.</p>
            <p>India Today reported that Gurugram was the most affected by this heavy rain. In just four hours, from 3 PM to 7 PM on September 1st, over 100 millimeters of rain fell. This flooded many important roads.</p>
            <p>Pictures and videos of the traffic in Gurugram stopping due to floods were shared widely on news and social media. Local schools and offices closed. Authorities also told schools to teach online and asked companies to let employees work from home.</p>
            <p>Officials said that because the rain is still falling and dams are releasing water, the Yamuna River's level might go even higher. People in low-lying areas of Delhi, especially near the Yamuna River, need to be careful.</p>
            <p>Authorities advised people living in areas where the Yamuna River has flooded to move to safe places. This is because the water level is expected to reach 206 meters tonight, which means people must leave.</p>
            <p>Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that the government is fully ready to deal with the current situation.</p>
            <p>Delhi and nearby cities like Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Noida have all had unusual rain. This has made the temperature lower than normal for this time of year.</p>

            <h1>Taitung YouBike2.0 Now in 6 Townships, First 30 Minutes Cost 5 NTD Less Until End of Year</h1>
            <p>Taitung County brought in YouBike2.0 in December last year. People are very happy with it, with a 96.6% satisfaction rate. Now, there are YouBike stations all over the main areas of Taitung City. They are also slowly adding more stations in townships like Guanshan and Chenggong. The county government says YouBike is now in 6 townships. Until December 31st, riders will get a NT$5 discount for the first 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>Currently, Taitung County has 92 YouBike stations. In the valley area, the stations go as far north as Guanshan Township, with stations at the train station, library, and Rice School. Along the coast, stations reach Chenggong Township. You can ride to enjoy the fishing port and try local foods like Chenggong douhua (tofu pudding).</p>
            <p>The Taitung County government announced today that making transportation greener is an important goal. To encourage people to travel in ways that create less carbon, the county government is offering a YouBike riding discount until December 31st this year. For both YouBike2.0 and YouBike2.0E, you can get a NT$5 discount for the first 30 minutes. The government asks everyone to use this chance to ride YouBike more often.</p>

            <h1>13-Year-Old Girl's Death Causes Anger, Malaysia Calls for Stronger Anti-Bullying Efforts in Schools</h1>
            <p>Zara, a 13-year-old Malaysian girl, died after falling from her school building. This sad event seems to be about school bullying and has made many people angry. Educators in Malaysia are now asking for more focus on stopping bullying. They say we need to find the places and cultures where bullying grows earlier and stop it.</p>
            <p>Zara Qairina fell from her school in July and died the next day. The police first said it was an accident and did not check her body right away. But as rumors spread that Zara was bullied to death by children of powerful families at her school, her body was checked on August 18th. Attorney General Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar confirmed that five teenage girls who are thought to have bullied her have been charged. However, they all said they are not guilty.</p>
            <p>This sad event has made Malaysian society very concerned about school bullying. In one area, 7,000 people gathered to demand justice for Zara. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim also said that the investigation must be clear and fair, and no one should be protected.</p>
            <p>The Deputy Minister of Education, Innovation, and Talent in Sarawak warned recently that bullying is becoming a bigger problem. Malaysian human rights lawyer Rao Zhaoying spoke to CNA and said that data shows bullying cases in Malaysia have gone from about 3,000 in 2015 to over 6,000 in 2024. This is an increase of more than 100%.</p>
            <p>Liang Shengyi, the CEO of the United Chinese School Committees' Association of Malaysia, said in an interview that Zara's case can be seen as "the last straw." It shows long-standing problems like a bullying culture that people ignore, a system that is slow and uncaring, and ways to protect rich and powerful people.</p>
            <p>He said that these numbers only show a small part of the problem. If officials had more understanding, they would see that bullying is a serious issue. They should investigate, analyze, and take necessary steps. This includes stopping, stepping in, and having ways to prevent bullying.</p>
            <p>He believes that in schools, for example, the current rules for bullying usually ask schools to respond after an event happens. But these rules mostly help after the bullying has started, to fix things, make decisions, and punish people.</p>
            <p>Liang Shengyi stressed that we should not wait until bullying has become a big problem before we start "anti-bullying" efforts. Everyone should find the environments and cultures that allow bullying to grow earlier and stop it before sad events happen. A better idea is to create a school environment where people respect each other and show love, so bullying cannot even start.</p>
            <p>Another reason this case is getting a lot of attention is that, according to Sin Chew Daily, Zara's case is the first time the government has used the "verbal threat" law to charge someone after making bullying a crime. The lawyer for Zara's family believes that a law with a more serious punishment, "intent to harm," should be used. There are also suspicions that the people who bullied Zara might be children of rich and powerful families. People worry that they might be protected because of their family background. This could make people think that "those with power and money can avoid punishment."</p>
