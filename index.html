            <h1>823 Referendum and Recall Votes Fail: Professor Ogasawara Says DPP's 10-Year Advantage Ends</h1>
            <p>A referendum to restart the third nuclear power plant did not pass because it did not get enough votes. Also, seven recall attempts against Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers all failed. Professor Yoshiyuki Ogasawara, a Japanese scholar and honorary professor at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, said today that these results show the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) no longer has its strong advantage of the past ten years. He believes that the two main political parties are now equally strong.</p>
            <p>Professor Ogasawara wrote on Facebook that the referendum was about "restarting the third nuclear power plant, which stopped working in May this year." This was a public vote on the DPP government's policy to stop using nuclear power. The opposition Taiwan People's Party suggested the referendum, the KMT supported it, and the DPP was against it. In the end, there were over 4.34 million votes in favor (74.2%) and over 1.51 million votes against (25.8%). Although more people voted in favor, it did not pass because it did not reach the necessary 25% of all eligible voters. Compared to the 2021 referendum, which had a 41.1% voter turnout, this one had only 29.5%, showing fewer people voted.</p>
            <p>The recall votes were for the remaining seven KMT lawmakers, and none of them passed. Overall, 33.9% voted to recall, and 66.1% voted against. This difference was even bigger than the first round of recall votes in July, which targeted 24 KMT lawmakers. The total voter turnout for these seven areas was 49.3%, which is lower than the previous 56.1%. This could mean that fewer DPP supporters decided to vote.</p>
            <p>Professor Ogasawara said that the recall votes were already decided on July 24th, so this second round was just a formality. The KMT felt confident, while DPP supporters were not very interested. After both rounds of recall votes, all 31 KMT lawmakers kept their positions. Professor Ogasawara's earlier analysis in July said that the results caused "a big blow to President Lai Ching-te's government and the DPP," and he does not need to change that idea now.</p>
            <p>He also stressed that the referendum shows that most people in Taiwan want the government to change its non-nuclear policy. In the 2010s, more people supported stopping nuclear power. But recently, due to the high electricity needs from semiconductors and AI, and slow progress in renewable energy, Taiwan has become more dependent on burning fossil fuels. This has made the "nuclear-free homeland" policy face difficulties. Also, problems with solar panels, like environmental concerns and corruption, have made people worried.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that these results show it is necessary to think about whether "nuclear-free homeland" has become just a slogan and if the ideas behind it need to be updated.</p>
            <p>Professor Ogasawara concluded that the "Summer Battle" of 2025 ended with a big loss for the DPP and a big win for the opposition parties. This again proves that the DPP's strong advantage from 2014 to 2024 is over. Taiwan's politics has entered a time where both sides are equally strong. The DPP needs to rebuild its two main ideas: "resisting China and protecting Taiwan" and "nuclear-free homeland." The opposition parties cannot just rely on being "anti-DPP," as this alone might not be enough to win the next election. The party that learns from these lessons will have an advantage in the 2028 general election.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Men's Volleyball Team Loses to South Korea in East Asian Championship, Finishes Second for 4th Time</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan men's volleyball team lost to South Korea in the final match of the East Asian Volleyball Championship. The scores were 22-25, 22-25, and 16-25. This means Taiwan has finished second for the fourth time in a row. The coach, Huang Hong-yu, said that their first goal was to reach the top four, so he is happy with getting second place.</p>
            <p>The East Asian Men's Volleyball Championship was held in Zhangjiagang, China. The Taiwan team was mostly made up of players from the Rhine-Ruhr World University Games. Although their main star player, Chang Yu-sheng, who plays in Japan, was not there, the team still had talented young players like Wen Yi-kai and Chang Yu-chen. They worked together to narrowly beat host country China 3-2 in the semi-finals. This helped the Taiwan men's team reach the final for the eighth time in a row.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan men's team played against their strong rival, South Korea, in the final. They hoped to get revenge for losing to them 3-2 in the preliminary round. However, the Taiwan team could not handle the pressure. They made mistakes at important moments, which led to them losing the first two sets 22-25 and 22-25.</p>
            <p>With no more chances, the Taiwan men's team still could not stop South Korea's strong attacks in the third set. They also could not control their mistakes, so the point difference kept growing. In the end, they lost 16-25. This is the fourth time in a row they have finished second in the East Asian Men's Volleyball Championship. They also could not win the championship again after their last victory in 2013.</p>
            <p>After the game, Coach Huang Hong-yu told reporters that their main goal was to be in the top four. So, finishing second was better than they expected. He also noted that this gave other training players a chance to play in an international competition, which helps build up future talent for the Taiwan men's volleyball team. He believes the team's good atmosphere is their biggest strength. They face wins and losses with a positive attitude. He said, "Even if someone makes a mistake, we don't scold them right away."</p>
            <p>However, Coach Huang Hong-yu pointed out that he hopes the players, after experiencing the high level of volleyball from other countries, will continue to improve their strength and serving consistency. He especially wants them to reduce mistakes. He added, "When we play against higher-level teams in the future, being consistent is what shows a high-quality performance and demonstrates the team's true strength."</p>

            <h1>Recall Attempts Against 7 KMT Lawmakers All Fail, Foreign Media Says This May Worsen Political Stalemate</h1>
            <p>Today, all seven recall attempts against Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in Taiwan failed. Foreign news reported that voters again rejected the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) efforts to change the number of seats in the parliament. This might make the political situation harder and complicate Taiwan's plans to greatly increase military spending and deal with increasing pressure from Beijing.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the DPP did not win more than half of the seats in last year's parliamentary election. This was the ruling party's second try in a month to regain control of the parliament. However, the vote counts showed that the DPP failed again.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that in the first round of recall votes on July 26th, all 24 KMT lawmakers also kept their positions. The ruling DPP faced a big loss.</p>
            <p>Experts believe the failures happened because President Lai Ching-te focused on the difficult relationship with China instead of more on daily life issues for people. This made voters tired of voting. Most people expected the results of this second round of recall votes. All major political parties did not strongly encourage their supporters to vote this time.</p>
            <p>The failure of the recall attempts could make the political situation worse. The opposition parties might continue to challenge President Lai's plans. Important issues include next year's government budget, military spending, and the approval of new Grand Justices.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that President Lai spoke about the election results at the Presidential Office tonight. He said that Premier Cho Jung-tai had offered to resign many times after the July 26th recall votes. But President Lai wants Premier Cho to stay in his job and continue with his important duties.</p>
            <p>President Lai said that the government will make necessary changes to its staff to make the team work better and to make people feel the government is doing more.</p>
            <p>Also, a referendum held today about restarting the third nuclear power plant did not get enough votes to pass.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the DPP is against restarting the third nuclear power plant unless its safety is guaranteed and there is a solution for nuclear waste. The main opposition party, the KMT, supports restarting it. They argue that nuclear power is needed for energy security.</p>
            <p>After the referendum results were announced, President Lai said he respects the outcome. He added, "I also fully understand society's hope for different energy choices."</p>
            <p>President Lai stated, "For decades, while discussing nuclear power, the biggest agreement in Taiwanese society has been 'safety.' Nuclear safety is a scientific issue, a problem that needs scientific testing. It cannot be completely solved by one referendum." A public opinion poll released earlier this month by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation showed that 66.4% of people agreed that the third nuclear power plant should continue to operate after the relevant authorities confirm it is safe.</p>
            <p>However, some people believe this referendum was a waste of time because restarting the third nuclear power plant depends on "relevant authorities" approving it first.</p>
            <p>Assistant Professor Chen Fang-yu from Soochow University's Political Science Department said, "Whether it passes or not, the decision is still with the government, so it won't make any difference at all."</p>
