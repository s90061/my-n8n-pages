            <h1>Chinese Scientists Are Leaving the US; Statistics Expert Liu Jun Joins Tsinghua University in Beijing</h1>
            <p>Reports say that due to tensions between the US and China, well-known Chinese scientists are leaving the US and returning to work in China. The two most recent are statistics expert Liu Jun and microbiologist Wang Leyao.</p>
            <p>Today's report from Beijing by Sing Tao Daily points out that because US-China relations are tense and the US government has greatly cut research funding, many Chinese scientists are going back to China. After Wang Leyao, a microbiologist from the US National Institutes of Health, the famous international statistician Liu Jun officially joined Tsinghua University in Beijing full-time two days ago.</p>
            <p>The report says that Tsinghua held a ceremony for him two days ago to welcome him. People like the university's Party Committee Secretary and the President were there.</p>
            <p>According to the report, Liu Jun used to be a professor in the Statistics Department at Harvard University. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Statistical Association. He has done important work in areas like Bayesian inference, computational biology, and bioinformatics. He also won the "COPSS Presidents' Award," which is the highest honor in international statistics.</p>
            <p>He graduated from Peking University with a degree in mathematics in 1985 and received his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1991.</p>
            <p>Tsinghua President Li Luming said at the ceremony that he hopes Liu Jun will use his wide academic influence after joining Tsinghua. He expects Liu Jun to help Tsinghua take advantage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is led by artificial intelligence. This will help Tsinghua's statistics and data science departments improve and train more talented people.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Shenzhen Medical Academy announced last week that Wang Leyao joined them full-time in July.</p>
            <p>Wang Leyao graduated from Nankai University and earned his PhD in microbiology from Fudan University. He did postdoctoral research at Johns Hopkins University and Yale University in the US. Before this, he was an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts School of Public Health and Health Sciences and a climate and health scholar at the US National Institutes of Health.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Wang Leyao's team focuses on human microbiology. They work to understand how microbes, hosts, and pathogens interact.</p>
            <p>The report also says that many Chinese-American scientists have left the US and returned to China in recent years. These include Chen Min, a math professor at Purdue University, Liu Chang, a nuclear physicist at Princeton University, Lin Huaxin, a math professor at the University of Oregon, and Zhan Hanyu, an optical researcher at Corning Inc. in the US.</p>
            <p>Also, Zhang Yitang, a top mathematician in the world, returned to China in June. He joined Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou full-time. Zhang Yitang reportedly said that he returned to China because of the situation faced by Chinese-American scientists in the US in recent years.</p>

            <h1>Xi Jinping: SCO's Responsibility to Keep Regional Peace and Stability Is Growing</h1>
            <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit started yesterday in Tianjin. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan held a dinner last night to welcome international guests. Xi Jinping said that currently, there are clearly more things that cause instability, so the SCO has a greater responsibility to keep peace and stability in the region.</p>
            <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit took place in Tianjin from August 31 to September 1. According to China's state media, CCTV News, yesterday, Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan held a dinner at the Tianjin Meijiang Convention and Exhibition Center last night. They welcomed the international guests who were there for the SCO summit.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that more than 20 foreign leaders, heads of government, and their partners were at the summit. These included leaders from SCO member states, observer states, dialogue partners, and guests of the host country. Also, 10 leaders from international organizations, including the UN Secretary-General, attended.</p>
            <p>During his speech at the meeting, Xi Jinping said that since it started, the SCO has made unity and trust stronger, deepened practical cooperation, and taken part in international and regional matters. It has become "an important force for building new international relations and a community with a shared future for humanity." He added that the world is changing very quickly, and there are clearly more things that are unstable, uncertain, and hard to predict. Because of this, the SCO has an even bigger job to keep peace and stability in the region and help all countries grow and do well.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that this summit has an important task: to bring everyone to an agreement, make cooperation stronger, and plan for future growth. The SCO will surely do more and grow more. It will help its member countries work together, gather strength from the Global South, and help human civilization progress even further.</p>
            <p>Cai Qi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Yi, Foreign Minister, Chen Min'er, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Wang Xiaohong, Minister of Public Security, among others, attended the event.</p>
