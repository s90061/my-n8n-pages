            <h1>Pope Creates New Diocese in China; People Worry About Persecution of Underground Church</h1>
            <p>The Vatican announced today that Pope Leo XIV has created a new church area called "Zhangjiakou" in Hebei, China. The Pope has chosen Wang Zhengui as the new bishop. This decision follows a temporary agreement between the Vatican and China. The old church areas of Xiwanzi and Xuanhua, which the Vatican had set up, are now closed and part of the new Zhangjiakou area. Some Catholic news groups are concerned that this might make the Chinese government treat the unofficial Catholic church in China more harshly.</p>
            <p>Chinese Catholic websites shared news about Bishop Wang Zhengui's special ceremony today. The Vatican's press office also said today that Pope Leo XIV chose Wang Zhengui, who is 62, on July 8th. The Pope agreed to Wang Zhengui's selection based on the temporary agreement between the Vatican and China.</p>
            <p>The Vatican stated that on July 8th, the Pope closed the Xiwanzi and Xuanhua church areas. These areas are now part of the new Zhangjiakou church area, which is under the Beijing church region.</p>
            <p>Asia News reported that the Pope's decision is very important. This is because Hebei province is one of the oldest and most important places for Catholicism in China. Many Catholic priests and followers there have not joined the "Patriotic Church," which the Chinese government controls. They have faced much pressure from the government. Now, the Pope has accepted the church area and bishop chosen by the Chinese government. This sends a strong message to the unofficial church.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Cui Tai, the former bishop of Xuanhua, which Pope Leo XIV closed, was often stopped by the Chinese government from doing his job because he refused to join the Patriotic Church. The Vatican's statement did not say what will happen to Cui Tai after his church area was closed. However, priests in Hebei province have heard that there will be a "retirement ceremony" for Cui Tai on the 12th. Also, the former bishop of Xiwanzi will become a helper bishop for the Zhangjiakou church area.</p>
            <p>The place "Xiwanzi" is well-known in Chinese Catholic history. During a 100-year period when Catholicism was forbidden in the Qing Dynasty, many foreign Catholic priests found safety there. They built churches and shared their faith, making it a famous Catholic village. In 1945, during the Chinese Civil War, there was fighting in Xiwanzi. The Chinese Communist army killed and robbed Catholics there and burned churches. This event is known as the "Xiwanzi Incident."</p>
            <p>Pope Pius XII issued a letter on April 11, 1946, to set up the Catholic Church's structure in China. The Xiwanzi and Xuanhua church areas were created at that time.</p>
            <p>Asia News said that Pope Leo XIV might hope this decision will help unite the church in China. However, many signs show this might not happen. The Chinese government has been increasing its control over religion lately. It keeps promoting education about loving the party and the country. For example, Bishop Shen Bin of Shanghai even brought church members together to watch a live broadcast of a big Chinese military parade on September 3rd.</p>

            <h1>Macron Appoints New Prime Minister, But Public Anger Continues; Many Anti-Government Protests Happen</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, French President Emmanuel Macron chose a new prime minister, SÃ©bastien Lecornu. But this did not stop people from being angry. Today, many people in different cities protested against the government. They were angry about less money for public services and unfairness in society. The government sent 80,000 police and military police to keep the peace.</p>
            <p>These protests were called "Block Everything." They started on social media and many young people joined. More and more people became angry because prices were going up, the government was spending less money, and they felt the government did not understand their problems. Some groups on the left side of politics also supported the protests.</p>
            <p>The French Interior Ministry said that 175,000 people protested across the country, and 473 people were arrested. The CGT, a big worker's union, said that 250,000 people protested. People protesting wanted fair treatment in society and wanted the government to stop its new budget plan.</p>
            <p>In Paris, many protesters gathered in the ChÃ¢telet and Les Halles areas in the afternoon. Police asked for nearby subway stations to close for a short time. Many shops around these areas also closed.</p>
            <p>Protesters held signs that said things like "Macron Resign," "People, Stand Up," and "Tax Rich People." Some people shouted these words. Some protesters also burned trash cans and set fire to a building. The fire was put out quickly, but it left a black mark. Police used shields and tear gas to make the crowds leave.</p>
            <p>Hector, who is under 30 and works in a public museum, made his own pirate flag for the protest. It said "Tout Bloquer," which means "Block Everything."</p>
            <p>He told a reporter that he was unhappy because the government was cutting money for important things like health and education. He said that money was being moved to police and military services instead. He also said hospitals did not have enough staff, money for people with disabilities was getting smaller, and schools had less money. This meant classes were too full, and teachers were paid too little, so students could not learn well.</p>
            <p>Hector said, "We want to keep our rights. In the early 1900s, we won things like paid holidays and other social rights. But now, we are losing these things. We want to slow down this change."</p>
            <p>AmÃ©lys, who is 25, told a reporter that she does not like the government or capitalism, and she dislikes Macron. She said that Macron choosing Lecornu as the new prime minister "does not help at all. It is just a different person doing the same things."</p>
            <p>The old prime minister of France, FranÃ§ois Bayrou, had suggested a plan to save 44 billion euros to lower the country's debt. He also wanted to remove two public holidays. This made many people and other politicians angry. So, Bayrou asked Parliament to vote if they still trusted him. He lost the vote and resigned yesterday to President Macron.</p>

            <h1>UN General Assembly Starts; Times Square Ad in New York Asks for Taiwan's Inclusion</h1>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly began on September 9th at the UN headquarters in New York. Today, Taiwanese business groups from North America put an advertisement on a screen in Times Square. The ad asks for Taiwan to be able to join the United Nations. Hsu Chia-ching, who leads the Overseas Community Affairs Council, said she is thankful that other countries are now saying that the old way of understanding Resolution 2758 was wrong. She believes Taiwan should now be part of the UN and other international groups in a real way.</p>
            <p>When the UN General Assembly starts, the topic of Taiwan joining the UN and not being able to take part in UN activities comes up again. Taiwanese business groups from North America collected money to put up ads on screens in Times Square, New York. They started showing the ads when the assembly began, asking people to keep thinking about this issue.</p>
            <p>The North American Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce helped to create this advertisement. Besides the English word "Taiwan," the ad also showed words starting with "U" like Unlock, Unfold, Unveil, Unleash, and Unbound. These words are used to connect with the idea of the United Nations (UN).</p>
            <p>The video ad also showed the words "AI" and "UN2025." It had messages like "Better Together," which is the main idea for this year's General Assembly, and "Chip in with Taiwan," which means Taiwan wants to help.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching, the head of the Overseas Community Affairs Council, along with Li Chih-chiang, the director of the New York Office, and Pearl Pai, the leader of the North American Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, and other Taiwanese community leaders, all saw the ad playing in Times Square.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching said that the Republic of China, which is Taiwan, was forced to leave the United Nations. This happened when the People's Republic of China took the place of Chiang Kai-shek's government. Resolution 2758 was then passed. But she said the original words and meaning of this resolution only meant that the People's Republic of China would represent China, not Chiang Kai-shek's government. She stressed that the resolution did not include the Republic of China or Taiwan.</p>
            <p>She added that for the past 50 years, this explanation has sadly been used incorrectly. She thanked countries like the European Union, the United States, and Canada for now saying that the old way of understanding Resolution 2758 was wrong. She believes Taiwan should now be able to join the United Nations and other international groups in a real and important way.</p>
            <p>Li Chih-chiang held a meeting with reporters at the New York office. He said that the UN General Assembly started on September 9th. The main idea for the 80th assembly is "Better Together." Last year, the idea was "Leaving No One Behind." He said it is sad that Taiwan has been left out of the UN since 1971.</p>
            <p>He explained that the main reason is that China has wrongly understood Resolution 2758. China has also wrongly linked it to its "One China Principle." This has made it very hard for Taiwan to join. He said it is important to let people around the world know about this unfair situation for Taiwan.</p>
