            <h1>Zelenskyy: Ukraine Makes Almost 60% of Its Own Weapons</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that nearly 60% of the weapons used by the Ukrainian army are made in Ukraine. This number is higher than the goal he set two months ago.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelenskyy said in his evening speech, "During this war, Ukraine has reached a point where almost 60% of the weapons we have, the weapons in the hands of our soldiers, are made in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>He added, "These weapons are very strong and have many modern features."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy and other officials have always said that making more weapons in Ukraine is very important for the country's future safety.</p>
            <p>Ukraine has been focusing on making drones and providing air defense systems. These are used to stop Russia's many drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>
            <p>Officials also said that making drones to stop enemy drones is a good and cheap way to fight against Russia's air attacks.</p>

            <h1>Portugal Cable Car Crash: Investigators Say Broken Cable Might Be the Cause</h1>
            <p>On September 3, a cable car went off its tracks in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. 16 people died. Today, investigators said that the cable connecting the two cars broke just before the accident. This happened even though the cable passed a visual check earlier that day.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Portuguese Air and Rail Accident Investigation Bureau (GPIAAF) released a statement. It said, "Based on the evidence we have now, the cable car was regularly checked. On the morning of the accident, a normal visual check was done. At that time, no problems were found with the cable or the brake system of the cable car."</p>
            <p>But the statement also said that before the accident, it was not possible to visually check the part where the cable connects to the car.</p>
            <p>According to the first findings from the investigators, the cable car hit at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour. The whole accident happened in just 50 seconds.</p>
            <p>The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported that investigators said they have not yet given a final reason for the accident. They will give a full first report within 45 days.</p>
