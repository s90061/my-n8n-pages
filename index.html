            <h1>42 New Tanks Arrive in Taiwan and Move to Hsinchu Base</h1>
            <p>The second group of 42 M1A2T tanks that Taiwan bought from the United States arrived at Taipei Port last night. Around 12:10 AM today, large private trucks carried them out of the port. They were moved to the Armored Forces Training Command in Hukou, Hsinchu. Police and military police helped control the traffic during the move.</p>
            <p>The army has about one thousand tanks, including CM-11 Brave Tiger tanks and M60A3 tanks. But these tanks have been used for more than 20 years. So, the army bought new engines for the M60A3 tanks. Also, the army has set aside NT$40.5 billion (about USD 1.3 billion) from 2019 to 2027 to buy 108 M1A2T tanks from the U.S. These tanks are called "the strongest tanks on Earth." They will be placed with the Sixth Army Corps to protect the northern part of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The first group of 38 M1A2T tanks arrived in Taiwan last December. On July 10th, they practiced firing their 120mm tank guns at the Kengzukou training ground in Hsinchu. Four tanks fired a total of 19 shots. The targets looked like the front of Chinese Communist tanks. The tanks used a "Hunter-Killer" system and hit all the targets.</p>
            <p>This second group of 42 M1A2T tanks was supposed to arrive at Taipei Port by ship on the evening of July 26th. But because of a typhoon, their arrival was delayed until last night.</p>
            <p>A reporter from CNA was outside Taipei Port. Around 12:10 AM today, many M1A2T tanks, covered in black waterproof cloth, left the port on private trucks. They were moved along the West Coast Expressway to the Army Armored Forces Training Command in Hukou, Hsinchu. Police controlled traffic along the way, and military police vehicles followed the tanks.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that Taiwan is not only buying 108 M1A2T tanks. It is also buying 14 M88A2 recovery vehicles, 16 M1070A1 transport vehicles, and 16 M1000 transport trailers at the same time.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Hsu Yu-hsiou and Huang Tsung-hao Win Doubles Title at ATP Challenger Event</h1>
            <p>Today, Taiwanese tennis players Hsu Yu-hsiou and Huang Tsung-hao won the men's doubles final at the ATP Bloomfield Hills Challenger. They won the match with scores of 4-6, 6-3, 11-9. This is the first time they have won a Challenger men's doubles title together.</p>
            <p>The ATP Bloomfield Hills Challenger is a tennis tournament in the U.S. with a total prize money of 160,000 US dollars (about 4.7 million New Taiwan Dollars). This week, Taiwanese tennis players Hsu Yu-hsiou and Huang Tsung-hao played in the men's doubles. They played very well and won many matches. In the quarter-finals, they beat the top-seeded team. In the semi-finals, they beat another Taiwanese player, Jason Jung, and American player Reese Stalder. They successfully reached the final.</p>
            <p>In today's men's doubles final, Hsu Yu-hsiou and Huang Tsung-hao played against the home team, Theodore Winegar and Michael Zheng. They lost the first set 4-6. However, the Taiwanese team did not give up. They slowly found their rhythm in the second set and won it 6-3, making the score even.</p>
            <p>The match then went to a deciding tie-break to 10 points. Hsu Yu-hsiou and Huang Tsung-hao had a very close match with their opponents. But at an important moment, the Taiwanese team scored 4 points in a row, giving them match point first. Even though their opponents saved two match points, Hsu Yu-hsiou and Huang Tsung-hao still won the game 11-9. They successfully won the ATP Challenger men's doubles title. This is also Huang Tsung-hao's first ATP Challenger men's doubles title in his career.</p>
            <p>After the match, Hsu Yu-hsiou told CNA that winning their first ATP Challenger men's doubles title together was not easy. They won three matches by coming back after being behind. The most important thing was taking their chances in the tie-breaks. He said he was very happy to win the title. He also said, "We will play two more weeks of Challenger tournaments in the U.S., and we hope to do well there too."</p>
