Google is changing its search engine with a new feature called "AI Overviews." This update uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make searching for information simpler and faster. Instead of just showing a list of websites, Google will now give you a summary answer directly at the top of your search results.

This new AI can understand complicated questions and offer direct answers, similar to having a conversation with someone. For example, if you ask "how to clean a really dirty oven," the AI might give you step-by-step instructions. Google hopes this will save people time and make finding information online feel more natural and helpful. This is a big step in how we use the internet every day.

**AI Expected to Improve Work and Economy**

New reports suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) will greatly increase how much work people can do and also help the economy grow. Experts believe AI is changing workplaces by taking over simple, repeated jobs. This allows people to focus on more creative and difficult tasks.

While some are worried about jobs disappearing, many believe AI will actually help workers do their jobs better and even create new types of jobs. This means people will need to learn new skills to work with AI. This big change in how we work is seen as a good thing for money-making and a country's total income, known as GDP.

**Europe Tries New Ways to Handle Too Many Tourists**

Many famous places in Europe, like Venice in Italy, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and Santorini in Greece, are getting too many visitors. This problem, called "overtourism," can harm the local people and the environment.

To fix this, some cities are starting new rules. For example, Venice has begun to charge a small fee for day-trippers. Amsterdam is trying to stop certain kinds of tourism that cause problems. Other places are limiting how many large cruise ships can visit. The main goal is to make tourism more sustainable, meaning it protects the environment and local culture. They also want to encourage people to visit at different times of the year, not just during the busiest seasons.
