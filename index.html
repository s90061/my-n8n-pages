Polish tennis player Iga Swiatek, 24, won her first Wimbledon women's singles title. She easily defeated American player Amanda Anisimova with a score of 6-0, 6-0. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title in her career. The match was very quick, lasting only 57 minutes. Anisimova is the first player since 1911 to lose a Wimbledon final without winning a single game. Swiatek, who had previously won the French Open four times, said she was surprised and never expected such an easy win at Wimbledon. She feels her performance has greatly improved this year.

**Iran's Foreign Minister: New Cooperation with IAEA**

Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, announced that Iran will work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a new way. Earlier this month, Iran had passed a law to stop some of its cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog. Araghchi stated that their cooperation has not ended but will now happen in a different manner. Iran plans to review each request to inspect its nuclear sites individually, making sure safety is the main concern. He also mentioned that Iran is ready to use talks to build trust about its nuclear program, but other countries must also show they want diplomacy and are not using it to hide other plans.
