<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-china-airlines-postpones-retirement-051339368.html">News Link</a>

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan's China Airlines is postponing the retirement of some of its older aircraft. This is because Boeing has been slow in delivering new 787-9 jets. The airline's newly appointed chairman suggested that Boeing might have to pay compensation for these delays.

China Airlines, founded in 1959, is currently updating its fleet. Last year, the airline ordered new long-haul planes, worth nearly $12 billion, from both Boeing and Airbus. China Airlines also ordered 24 Boeing 787s, including 18 787-9s and six of the larger 787-10s, for regional and some longer routes.

Chairman George Kao stated that the plan to replace older Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s with 787-9s and A321neos is affected by slow deliveries, especially for the 787-9s. "We are currently very affected. Some aircraft that were planned to be retired, or returned at the end of their lease, will remain and have their leases extended," he told Reuters during an interview at the airline's headquarters in Taoyuan, Taiwan's main international airport.

Boeing has not given China Airlines a firm date for the 787-9 delays, but has indicated that deliveries will "basically" start by the end of 2025. Kao, who began his career as a flight attendant and became chairman in March, added that the contract includes provisions for compensation if Boeing is responsible for the delays, such as issues in the supply chain. Boeing did not comment on the matter.

Other airlines are experiencing similar problems. Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), recently called the predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade "unacceptable."

Despite these issues, Kao remains positive about expansion. He mentioned that the more fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s ordered last year will allow for more flights to destinations like New York and London. He also noted that a new third terminal at Taoyuan airport is expected to open its first section later this year, which will greatly improve the travel experience.

Kao also hinted at adding more aircraft for Mandarin Airlines, a subsidiary that mostly flies domestic routes with ATR-72 turboprops. Mandarin Airlines is being restructured to focus on regional routes from southern and central Taiwan with new jet aircraft. He stated that discussions with aircraft lessors are underway to support Mandarin Airlines' growth.

China Airlines faces competition from long-standing rival EVA Air and the rapidly expanding Starlux Airlines, which recently ordered 10 more A350s. Kao believes that while Taiwan's local market is small, transit traffic, which all three airlines are targeting, is sufficient to support three full-service airlines. He highlighted Taoyuan airport's convenient location for connecting the Pacific to Asia, and its advantages over other regional hubs like Seoul's Incheon (too large), Tokyo (expensive landing fees), and Hong Kong (political issues).

**JPMorgan Sees Asian Tech Stocks Gaining Another 15-20% This Year**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-sees-asian-tech-stocks-034043507.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- Asian technology stocks may rally another 15%-20% this year, driven mainly by the strong momentum in the artificial intelligence space, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.

‚ÄúAI will continue to lead this upcycle on the growth in datacenter capex in 2025 and more confidence in 2026 growth,‚Äù analysts including Gokul Hariharan wrote in a report. ‚ÄúWe are not advising any meaningful rotation away from AI stocks in the next three months and would prefer‚Äù to stick with the winners.

AI stocks are rapidly emerging as pivotal drivers of the region‚Äôs equity markets, underpinned by a robust domestic appetite for automation and generative technology. A Bloomberg regional semiconductor index has risen over 12% this year to outperform an Asian equity gauge, and resilient demand for AI memory chips from big tech providers may drive further gains.

JPMorgan‚Äôs top stock picks include the region‚Äôs largest chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., SK Hynix Inc., Advantest Corp and Delta Electronics Inc. Those shares should continue their upward momentum in the next 12 months, as demand is not an issue and earnings will continue to be revised up, they wrote.

The bank is more cautious on non-AI stocks, such as makers of personal computers, smartphones and consumer devices. Earnings downward revisions may continue as the impact of China consumption subsidies fades, the report added.

**South Korea May Delay US Trade Deal Over Threats To Its China-Based Chipmakers**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-may-delay-us-113126134.html">News Link</a>

South Korea is preparing to confront U.S. officials over potential restrictions on chipmakers operating in China.

Ahead of the third round of tariff talks in Washington this week, South Korean Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo said he will raise industry concerns over possible U.S. curbs that could hurt Korean semiconductor firms in China, reported Reuters.

‚ÄúI will pass on the concerns among those in the industry and take utmost care,‚Äù Yeo told reporters before departing for Washington on Sunday.

The talks were originally expected to conclude with a trade agreement by July 8, but Yeo indicated that the deadline may slip due to political and economic uncertainties in the U.S., the report added.

Seoul is currently subject to a 10% blanket tariff, with an additional 25% country-specific duty temporarily suspended for 90 days.

Yeo, who was appointed this month by newly elected President Lee Jae Myung, also plans to meet officials at the White House and U.S. Congress to discuss multiple trade issues, including a U.S. request for South Korea to relax its restrictions on American beef imports.

South Korean chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix, rely heavily on Chinese operations and new U.S. policies could upend their supply chains.

Earlier this month, it was reported SK Hynix has secured custom high-bandwidth memory (HBM) orders from Nvidia Corp, Microsoft Corp., and Broadcom Inc.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co will produce the logic dies for SK Hynix's custom HBM chips. The first offering, the seventh-generation HBM4E, is expected to launch in the second half of 2026.

Last year, it was reported that Chinese tech firms, including Huawei Technologies Co and Baidu Inc, were stockpiling HBM semiconductors from Samsung ahead of potential U.S. export restrictions.
