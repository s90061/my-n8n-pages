            <h1>National Filial Piety Award Winners Are Over 60 Years Old, Showing the Importance of Care for Older People and Help Between Generations.</h1>
            <p>The 2025 National Filial Piety Awards ceremony will happen on August 13th in Penghu County Performing Arts Center. 30 people will receive awards. The Ministry of Interior said that 20 of this year's winners are over 60 years old. This shows that helping older people and support between different generations are becoming more important. It also highlights how "smart filial piety" is valuable and useful today.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior shared in a news release today that the National Filial Piety Award has been running for 43 years. Every year, through public selection and awards, it finds and praises ordinary heroes who quietly take good care of their families. This helps remind society about the value of respecting parents and older people. The 2025 National Filial Piety Awards ceremony will be held on August 13th at the Penghu County Performing Arts Center.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior said that this year's National Filial Piety Award continued the idea of "different ways of showing filial piety." They chose 30 excellent examples of filial piety from 5 groups: long-term care, good use of resources, helping to achieve goals, working together, and showing respect. For example, Lin Yu-cai from Penghu County, in the long-term care group, has patiently helped her mother go to the doctor and do physical therapy for more than 20 years. She took on the care work without complaint and supported her mother kindly through hard times. Yu Su-ching from Taichung City, in the good use of resources group, applied for long-term care services for her father-in-law. She brought in an oxygen machine and equipment to check blood oxygen. She also learned to be a nursing assistant in an integrated hospital ward and got a care license, so she could personally help care for her father-in-law while he was in the hospital.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has become a super-aging society, meaning many older people live here. The Ministry of Interior said that the average age of this year's award winners and the people they care for has also gone up a lot. This year, 20 winners are over 60 years old. Also, 3 people they care for are over 100 years old. This shows that helping older people and support across generations are more important now. It also highlights the value and use of smart ways to show filial piety today.</p>
            <p>To show respect to the filial piety role models, the Ministry of Interior gives each winner NT$50,000 and an award. Those from low or middle-income families also get an extra NT$30,000. This is to encourage more people to value family love and show filial piety now. The Ministry of Interior also said that you can see more stories of this year's filial piety role models in the "2025 Filial Piety Award Album" (<a href="https://www.moi.gov.tw/cl.aspx?n=11177" target="_blank">https://www.moi.gov.tw/cl.aspx?n=11177</a>).</p>

            <h1>Teacher Dong Yi-chun from Tainan First Senior High School Wins Award for Creating Museum Research Course.</h1>
            <p>Dong Yi-chun, a teacher at Tainan First Senior High School, has worked in art education for many years. She created the first museum research course. She encourages students to use art to connect with their local area and the world, helping many students learn and grow. She won this year's Teacher's Day Award.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education released a news report today, introducing 8 Teacher's Day Award winners from schools under the National and Pre-school Education Administration. Dong Yi-chun, a teacher at Tainan First Senior High School, created the country's only course called "Museum Inquiry, Visits, and Practice." This course combines humanities, technology, and art. She leads students to plan and create real exhibitions, helping them understand culture and take part in public life. She also worked with the National Museum of Taiwan History for an exhibition and won the 2018 Ministry of Education Teaching Excellence Gold Award.</p>
            <p>Besides creating new courses, Dong Yi-chun also believes in "education for everyone." She teaches all studentsâ€”those with special needs, those in regular classes, and gifted studentsâ€”with passion and love. She creates special learning content for them. She helps students create based on basic ideas, making the impossible possible and creating wonders. This shows her belief that "music is not just art, but also a way to show love and care."</p>
            <p>Su Yong-ching, a teacher at Kinmen High School, grew up on Taiwan's main island. Her first teaching job was at Kinmen High School, and she has stayed on the island for 18 years, moving from the city to a smaller island. She saw that students in rural areas felt lost and had problems. So, she started leading teachers to work together across different subjects to create a "Kinmen Studies" course. This course helps students explore their hometown, understand themselves, and build confidence through hands-on activities.</p>
            <p>Jiang Zeng Wei-mei, a director at Hualien Commercial High School, believes that education can change lives. She returned to her old school, Hualien Commercial High School, to teach. For 27 years, she has kept bringing in resources and new ways of teaching. She works in education with great passion and energy. Students, parents, and colleagues see her as a superhero. She is happy to take on big responsibilities and help students avoid difficulties. The smiles of students, the encouragement from colleagues, and the support from parents are what keep her going.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education announced the list of 2025 Teacher's Day Award winners in July. A total of 72 teachers received this highest honor in education. They will be officially honored in Taipei on September 18th.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: CapitalG and Nvidia Talking About Investing in Vast Data.</h1>
            <p>New York/San Francisco, August 1st (CNA) â€“ Two sources said that CapitalG, the investment part of Google's parent company Alphabet, and Nvidia, a big chip company, are discussing investing in Vast Data. Vast Data is a new company that works on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this round of investment could make Vast Data worth up to 30 billion US dollars (about 892.2 billion New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Two people who know about the talks said that companies that build the foundation for the AI boom are getting more attention. Vast Data is raising billions of dollars from many big tech companies, private equity firms, and venture capitalists. If the deal happens, Vast Data would become one of the most valuable new AI companies.</p>
            <p>According to the sources, CapitalG and Nvidia, who already support Vast Data, are currently talking about joining this investment round. The deal could be finished in a few weeks. The sources asked to remain private because the talks are confidential.</p>
            <p>Vast Data is based in New York and makes storage technology for large AI data centers. This technology helps transfer data efficiently between graphics processing units (GPUs), which are made by companies like Nvidia.</p>
            <p>Bankers and analysts said that Vast Data's customers include xAI (owned by Elon Musk) and CoreWeave, a cloud computing company. Vast Data's value in the AI supply chain makes it an attractive company for others to buy.</p>
            <p>Nvidia did not want to comment. Vast Data and CapitalG did not immediately reply to requests for comments from reporters.</p>
