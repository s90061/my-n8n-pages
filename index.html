            <h1>British Media: China's Economy Slows Down Due to Housing Market and Trade Problems, Causing Worry</h1>
            <p>The British newspaper Financial Times said that China's economy is growing slower. This is because of problems within China and with its trade with other countries. On August 15th, China officially announced its economic numbers for July. These numbers showed that retail sales (how much people buy), industrial production (how much factories make), and housing prices in 70 big cities either reached their lowest growth this year or continued to fall. This has made people worried about China's future economy.</p>
            <p>China's National Bureau of Statistics announced on August 15th the prices of new homes in 70 big cities for July. In big cities (called "first-tier"), medium-sized cities ("second-tier"), and smaller cities ("third-tier"), new home prices went down by 0.2% to 0.4% compared to June. Compared to last year, new home prices in first-tier cities fell by 1.1%. This has happened for 20 months in a row since December 2023. The report said directly that this makes people less hopeful that China's housing market will get better quickly.</p>
            <p>The report also said that these "sad" numbers, along with a trade fight between the US and China (with tariffs, or extra taxes, put in place by President Donald Trump), are hurting China's economy. The housing market in China has been slowing down for four years.</p>
            <p>Besides the housing market, China's consumer spending and factory production in July were also not good. The same data from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed that total retail sales only went up by 3.7% compared to last year, which is 1.1 percentage points less than in June. Also, industrial production only went up by 5.7% compared to last year, also 1.1 percentage points less than in June, and this is the lowest it has been this year.</p>
            <p>Because of these problems, the Chinese government, led by Xi Jinping, is trying to deal with prices falling (deflation) and too many goods being made by factories. Earlier official numbers showed that the cost of goods for regular people (consumer price index, or CPI) stayed the same in July compared to last year. But the cost of goods for factories (producer price index, or PPI) went down a lot, by 3.6% compared to last year.</p>
            <p>Yuhan Zhang, an expert on China's economy at The Conference Board China Center, said that people are buying less in China in the middle of the year. She said this is because demand is lower after long holidays, people's incomes are not growing fast, and people don't feel good about the economy.</p>
            <p>Lu Ting, a main economist for China at Nomura Securities, thinks that the weak housing market is the main reason for prices falling in China. He believes that the government's recent efforts to fix problems might not be enough to make the economy better by themselves.</p>
            <p>The report said that the housing market is a very important part of China's economic activity and how much money families have. But China's government has tried to make people feel more confident about the housing market by doing things like lowering loan interest rates, turning empty homes into housing for poor people, and removing limits on buying homes. However, these efforts have not worked. Many numbers related to the housing market are still going down clearly.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Yuhan Zhang said that even though most of these numbers are showing a slowdown, some areas of manufacturing are still growing fast. This is especially true for cars, trains, making ships, planes, and other transport equipment. This means that high-tech and important industries, which the government supports, are still getting a lot of money. These are what China's leaders call "high-quality production."</p>
            <p>Huang Zichun, an expert on China's economy at Capital Economics, thinks that China's economy is unlikely to get better for the rest of this year. He said this is because Chinese goods sent directly or indirectly to the US still have high extra taxes, so China's exports (goods sent to other countries) will probably continue to face problems.</p>

            <h1>Man Found Dead at Hualien Seawall, Police Think He Was Killed Over Drug Money; Suspect Held</h1>
            <p>On August 11th, a dead man was found at the Huaren Seawall in Hualien. Police found out the man was a 61-year-old named Mr. You. After looking into it, police believe he was beaten to death after an argument about money from a drug deal with a man named Mr. Lu. This happened while they were drinking alcohol. Today, police sent Mr. Lu to the court for charges of murder and causing serious injury leading to death. The prosecutor asked the court to keep Mr. Lu in custody, and the court agreed.</p>
            <p>Around 1:00 AM on August 11th, a person saw a man who was clearly dead on the Huaren Seawall in Ji-an Township. The Ji-an Police Station of Hualien County Police Department came to the place right away. They also called experts from the police station's forensic department to check fingerprints. They confirmed that the dead man was Mr. You, 61 years old, who lived in Chongde Village, Xiulin Township.</p>
            <p>Police saw marks on Mr. You's body that showed he had been hit. After checking the body, they found that his ribs were broken and he had bleeding inside his chest. This confirmed he was beaten to death. There were no cameras at the place where the body was found. So, police talked to many people and looked at many camera videos from nearby areas. They then suspected a 45-year-old man named Mr. Lu.</p>
            <p>Police found out that on the evening of August 10th, Mr. You and Mr. Lu were having a barbecue and drinking alcohol near the Huaren Seawall. They seemed to argue about money from a drug deal. After that, Mr. Lu used a key as a "knuckle duster" (a weapon for hitting) and hit Mr. You. Mr. You fell to the ground. Mr. Lu then left the area. When he got home, he started to feel that something was wrong. He went back to the place and found that Mr. You was not breathing anymore. So, he went to tell Mr. You's family. He told them that Mr. You suddenly fell down when they were drinking.</p>
            <p>The police reported this to the Hualien District Prosecutors Office, and the prosecutor told them how to do the investigation. After collecting evidence, the police had a warrant (a legal paper) to arrest Mr. Lu and brought him in. Mr. Lu finally said that he had hit Mr. You. After talking to him, the police sent him to the Hualien District Prosecutors Office for investigation. He is charged with murder and causing injury that led to death. The court agreed to keep him in custody.</p>
