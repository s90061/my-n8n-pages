Many families in the UK are finding it very difficult to manage their money because everything is becoming more expensive. Recent reports show that a large number of households are struggling with the high cost of living. Prices for essential items like food and energy have gone up significantly, which means people have less money left for other things.

As a result, many are cutting back on non-essential spending, such as going out or buying new clothes. Some families are using their savings or even borrowing money to pay for basic needs. This financial pressure is also causing stress and affecting people's mental well-being. Experts say that the situation is likely to continue, and more support is needed for those who are struggling the most.

**Artificial Intelligence is Changing the World of Work**

A new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could change almost 40% of jobs around the world. Generative AI, which can create text and images, is expected to have a major impact. The report explains that AI will affect jobs differently: some jobs might be completely replaced by AI, while others will be made better or more efficient with AI tools. Also, some completely new jobs might appear because of AI.

Richer countries, with more office-based jobs, are likely to see more changes from AI. It's important for workers to learn new skills and for governments to offer training programs. If we don't prepare well, AI could make the gap between rich and poor people wider, leading to more inequality in society.

**Venice Starts Charging Visitors to Reduce Crowds**

The beautiful city of Venice in Italy has begun to charge day-trip visitors a fee to enter. This new rule is part of an effort to manage the large number of tourists, a problem often called "overtourism." Starting on specific busy days, visitors who do not stay overnight in the city must pay a small fee.

The aim is to encourage people to visit during less busy times or to stay longer in the city, which helps local businesses more. Residents and tourists staying in hotels do not need to pay. This trial program makes Venice one of the first major cities to introduce such a fee. Many other popular tourist destinations around the world are watching to see if this method successfully helps protect the city and improve the experience for everyone.
