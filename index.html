            <h1>Ukraine and European Leaders to Talk with Trump on August 13th for Final Discussions Before US-Russia Summit</h1>
            <p>US President Trump and Russian President Putin will meet on August 15th to talk about a ceasefire in the war between Russia and Ukraine. This meeting will not include Ukraine or Europe, which has made many countries worried. Ukrainian news reports that Trump will speak with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders on August 13th. This call is probably the last chance to discuss things before the summit.</p>
            <p>"Ukraine Pravda" newspaper reports that Arianna Podesta, a spokesperson for the European Commission, shared that Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will talk on August 13th. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will lead the meeting. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and other European leaders will also be there to discuss the situation of the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>This phone call is likely seen as the last chance for Ukraine and European representatives to talk and plan their actions before the big meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy has been very active in diplomacy lately. For four days in a row, he has spoken with leaders from many countries, including Canada and Lithuania. He also talked with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who are usually more friendly with Russia.</p>
            <p>In a speech given at night, Zelenskyy said he talked with Modi about ideas to convince Russia. He said Modi has often stated that "now is not the time for war." Zelenskyy also wrote on social media earlier that they discussed stopping Russia from selling energy. They also plan to meet during the United Nations General Assembly in September and prepare for a special visit between their countries.</p>
            <p>The meeting between Trump and Putin is set for August 15th in Alaska, USA. People expect them to talk about how to stop the fighting in the Russia-Ukraine war. Earlier news reports showed a plan where Putin asked Ukrainian soldiers to leave the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine before a ceasefire could happen.</p>
            <p>In return, Russian soldiers would leave some parts of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions, but they would keep control of some areas they have taken.</p>
            <p>Also, people who know about the talks say Putin also suggested conditions for a ceasefire on the southern fighting front. This includes using the current battle lines as a border. Russian soldiers would keep control of most parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. However, the cities of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson themselves could remain with Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>US-Russia Summit to Begin on August 15th; Trump: "Looking Forward to Good Talks with Putin"</h1>
            <p>The leaders of the United States and Russia are going to meet on August 15th in Alaska, USA. They will talk about the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has been going on for more than three years. US President Trump said today that he hopes to have "constructive talks" with Russian President Putin.</p>
            <p>News agencies AFP and Reuters reported that Trump held a press conference at the White House. He said his meeting with Vladimir Putin on August 15th in Alaska will be a "trial talk." He wants to see if Putin is ready to make an agreement. Trump believes he will know in two minutes if they can make progress.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that he will talk to Putin and tell him, "You must end this war."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that right after his meeting with Putin on August 15th, he will immediately call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders.</p>
            <p>He mentioned, "The next meeting will be between Zelenskyy and Putin, or it will be all three of us: Zelenskyy, Putin, and myself. I will be there if they need me."</p>
            <p>Currently, Russia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine's land. Ukraine controls only a very small part of Russia's land. Trump said today, "Some land will be exchanged."</p>
            <p>Trump has talked about Russia and Ukraine exchanging land before. However, neither Russia nor Ukraine wants to give up land as part of a peace agreement.</p>
