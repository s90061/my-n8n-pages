            <h1>Venezuela Claims It Is Targeted by 8 US Warships with 1200 Missiles</h1>
            <p>Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said today that eight United States warships, carrying 1200 missiles, are aimed at his country. He called this a "bloody threat."</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that US President Donald Trump's government has accused Maduro of leading a drug trafficking group. The US has sent warships to the southern Caribbean Sea to fight drug crimes. However, the US has not openly threatened to attack Venezuela.</p>
            <p>During a meeting with international media today, Maduro strongly said that "eight US warships with 1200 missiles, and one submarine, are targeting Venezuela." He also said, "This is the biggest threat our continent (South America) has faced in the last 100 years."</p>
            <p>Maduro stated, "To deal with this very high military pressure, we have declared the highest level of readiness to defend Venezuela."</p>
            <p>Officials in Caracas said that they will patrol Venezuela's waters. They will also gather over 4 million civilian soldiers to respond to the US "threat."</p>
            <p>Maduro also claimed that talks with the US have stopped. He promised that Venezuela "will never give in to any form of blackmail or threat."</p>

            <h1>Ukraine Says Russia's Diplomacy Failed as SCO Summit Didn't Mention Russia-Ukraine War</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit did not talk about Russia's war against Ukraine in its main statement. This shows that Russia's diplomatic efforts have failed.</p>
            <p>The SCO held its summit from August 31 to September 1 in Tianjin. Leaders at the meeting signed the Tianjin Declaration. The 10 member countries of the SCO are Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement today. It said that it is important that the Tianjin Declaration did not mention the Russia-Ukraine war. The statement added, "It is surprising that such an important document did not mention the biggest war in Europe since World War II. Instead, it talked about many other wars, terrorist attacks, and events around the world."</p>
            <p>The statement also said that not mentioning the Russia-Ukraine war in the SCO summit declaration shows that Russia's diplomatic efforts have failed. It said that the Kremlin tried to make it seem like other countries had different opinions on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also tried to push the idea that "countries outside Europe and North America have positive views on the reasons, results, and ways to end the Russia-Ukraine war." But this attempt failed again.</p>
            <p>The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeated its stance. It said that all countries that want peace must follow international law and the United Nations Charter when they think about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also said, "Because China is very important in international politics, we would be happy if Beijing played a more active role in bringing peace to Ukraine, based on respect for the UN Charter."</p>

            <h1>Female Boxer Khelif Appeals to Sports Court Over World Boxing's Genetic Test Rule</h1>
            <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said today that Imane Khelif, an Algerian female boxer, has appealed to them. Khelif was part of a gender discussion at last year's Paris Olympics. She wants to overturn a rule by World Boxing (WB) that asks for genetic testing.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that CAS said in a statement that Khelif disagreed with World Boxing's (WB) decision. WB did not let Khelif compete in upcoming WB events without first taking a genetic test.</p>
            <p>Khelif and Taiwan's good boxer, Lin Yu-ting, were both involved in gender discussions during the Paris Olympics. Both of them later won gold medals. Lin Yu-ting will not be at the WB World Boxing Championships this week in Liverpool, UK.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-ting had already finished all her tests more than a month ago and sent the reports to WB. It is now known that WB needs 4 to 6 weeks for a general discussion. Because of this, Lin Yu-ting cannot join this year's World Championships for now.</p>
            <p>Khelif, who is 26 years old, denied last month that her former agent said she had stopped her boxing career.</p>
            <p>Khelif wrote on Facebook, "I want to make it clear to everyone that the news about me quitting boxing is not true."</p>
            <p>She accused her former agent, Nasser Yesfah, of "betraying (my) trust and (my) country with false and mean words."</p>
            <p>She said, "This person can no longer speak for me."</p>
