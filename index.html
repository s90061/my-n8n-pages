            <h1>Dutch Foreign Minister Resigns After Cabinet Disagrees on Israel Sanctions</h1>
            <p>The Dutch Foreign Minister, Caspar Veldkamp, resigned today. This happened because the Dutch government did not agree on new rules to punish Israel. They had meetings for many days but still couldn't decide.</p>
            <p>After Veldkamp resigned, his party, the "New Social Contract Party," also left the government. This made the political situation in the Netherlands even more difficult.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Veldkamp said he wanted to take new steps to pressure Israel. He was worried about Israel's strong actions against Hamas in the Gaza war.</p>
            <p>Last month, the Netherlands said that two Israeli ministers were not welcome in their country. These ministers were Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Netherlands also joined 20 other countries. They signed a statement that said Israel's plan to build more settlements in the West Bank was "unacceptable and against international law."</p>
            <p>But today, the government could not agree on how to put more pressure on Israel. Veldkamp told a Dutch news agency that he "could not take meaningful extra steps."</p>
            <p>He also said, "As Foreign Minister, I felt blocked when trying to make important decisions."</p>
            <p>Veldkamp said that his ideas for new actions against Israel were "discussed seriously" but met with problems in several government meetings.</p>
            <p>Since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and the war started, many people in the Netherlands have protested. They are against Israel's military actions. Very large protests have taken place in The Hague.</p>

            <h1>Special Cotton Swabs Are Medical Items; Importing Them Without Permission Can Cost You NT$2 Million</h1>
            <p>Cotton swabs might look simple, but Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) wants people to know something important today. If a cotton swab's package says "sterile," "disinfecting," or "for cleaning wounds," it is a medical item. If you bring these items back from other countries or buy them online without permission, you could pay a fine of up to NT$2 million.</p>
            <p>This warning comes after a recent story in the news. A person in Tainan bought cotton swabs from Taobao two years ago. Recently, police came to their home, arrested them, and they had to pay a fine of NT$100,000. This caused a lot of discussion.</p>
            <p>Money Jiahong, a leader from the TFDA's Medical Devices and Cosmetics team, explained today that cotton swabs have two types of uses. Medical items are used for health reasons. If a cotton swab package clearly says "sterile," "disinfecting," or "for cleaning wounds," it is a medical item. If it is just for cleaning skin and not for medical treatment, then it is a regular product.</p>
            <p>Money Jiahong said that only certain medical items can be sold online. The rules say that only licensed medical device sellers or pharmacies can sell them online. These products must have a permit in Taiwan. Sellers must also show the product's name and permit number on the website. Customers should always check for this information when buying online.</p>
            <p>He gave an example of medical cotton swabs. You can easily bring up to 200 medical cotton swabs for your own use into Taiwan without needing special permission from the TFDA. However, you can only do this once every six months.</p>
            <p>If you want to bring in more than 200 medical cotton swabs for yourself, Money Jiahong said you must apply for special permission. You need to give all the necessary documents and pay a fee. The amount you can bring in is limited to what you would use in six months. If you make or bring in medical items without permission, you can be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$2 million.</p>
            <p>Money Jiahong admitted that applying for personal use medical items has a fee. He suggested that people should think if the item is worth the cost. He advises people to check if an item is a medical device before buying it abroad. They should also check rules about how many items they can bring in, so they don't get into trouble.</p>
            <p>Regarding the Tainan person who was fined NT$100,000 for buying too many cotton swabs online, Money Jiahong explained that this fine was not because of the medical device law. It was because the person did not appear in court after being asked to. The police are still investigating the case, and the court has not made a final decision. So, the details are not yet clear.</p>
            <p>The TFDA added that they are checking online sales of medical devices more carefully. If they find any illegal sales, they will take action. If someone tries to sell or bring in medical devices without permission on purpose, they could go to prison for up to three years or pay a fine of up to NT$10 million.</p>

            <h1>2026 World Cup Draw on December 5th; Trump Touches Trophy and Asks if He Can Keep It</h1>
            <p>Today, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, announced that the drawing ceremony for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will happen on December 5th in Washington D.C. He also joked, asking if he could keep the World Cup trophy after he touched it.</p>
            <p>The 2026 World Cup will have 48 teams. The drawing event will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. Recently, President Trump made himself the head of this arts center. He said this was like fighting against "woke culture."</p>
            <p>President Trump made the announcement in his office at the White House. Gianni Infantino, the head of FIFA (the world's soccer organization), was with him. Trump called the World Cup "the biggest event, probably the biggest event in sports."</p>
            <p>The United States, Canada, and Mexico will all host the 2026 World Cup together. President Trump made sure to mention that this World Cup will happen while he is president.</p>
            <p>Mr. Infantino is good friends with President Trump. He brought the shiny golden World Cup trophy to today's news meeting and even let President Trump touch it.</p>
            <p>Infantino explained that usually, only the head of FIFA, the leaders of countries that win the World Cup, and the players on the winning team can touch the trophy. This is because it belongs only to the winners. He added that since President Trump is also a "winner," he could touch it. (He was talking about Trump winning the election again last year.)</p>
            <p>President Trump, who won the election again last year, held the trophy with both hands. He joked, "Can I keep it? This is truly a beautiful golden object."</p>
            <p>Trump also suggested that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, might come to the World Cup.</p>
            <p>He showed a picture that Putin sent him last week after a meeting in Alaska. Trump said that Putin "really hopes" to come, but it depends on whether peace in Ukraine happens.</p>
            <p>The United States was chosen to co-host the 2026 World Cup in 2018, during President Trump's first time as president.</p>
