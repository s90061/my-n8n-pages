            <h1>Instant Noodles Are Being Abandoned by Young Chinese People, 4 Billion Fewer Packs Sold in 3 Years</h1>
            <p>The instant noodle market in China is facing a very difficult time. In 2020, people in China ate over 46.3 billion packs of instant noodles in one year. This means each person ate about 32 packs. But in the next three years, sales dropped by 4 billion packs. Chinese media reports say that young people in China are not buying instant noodles anymore because they are becoming more expensive. Instead, they prefer cheaper and healthier options like food delivery and pre-made meals.</p>
            <p>News from Chinese media, including 21 Economic Net, Cover News, and China Business News, shows the current situation of the market. Tingyi Holding, a leading instant noodle company in China, released its financial report on August 11. In the first half of the year, Tingyi's instant noodle business income went down by 2.53% compared to last year. It was 13.465 billion Chinese Yuan (about 56.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars), which is 350 million Yuan less. Also, the number of distributors decreased by 3,409 in six months.</p>
            <p>Data from the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA) shows that the amount of instant noodles eaten in China (including Hong Kong) dropped. In 2020, it was at its highest with 46.36 billion packs. By 2023, it fell to 42.21 billion packs. This is a drop of over 4 billion packs in three years. In the second quarter of 2025, sales in the instant noodle industry went down by 8.9%. This food, which was once very popular in the country, is now losing its popularity.</p>
            <p>Why do young Chinese people not like instant noodles anymore? Chinese media reports all say that food delivery and pre-made dishes are very common now. Young people are stopping using instant noodles, which they felt were "not enough in one cup, but too much in two." Some internet users said, "For 6 yuan, you can order a delivery meal with meat and vegetables. Why would anyone spend 15 yuan on expensive instant noodles?"</p>
            <p>At the same time, instant noodles in China are getting more and more expensive. Classic packs that used to cost less than 5 yuan now often cost 6 yuan. More premium instant noodles with meat slices are sold for 15 to 20 yuan. Kangshifu, a noodle brand, even sells a high-end instant noodle product with Sam's Club for 79.9 yuan. This has made many customers decide not to buy them.</p>
            <p>The report also mentions that the spread of high-speed trains in China has made instant noodles lose a big market. In the past, the smell of instant noodles on old green trains was common. But now, travel times are shorter, and that smell is gone. Also, it is now forbidden to eat instant noodles on Chinese high-speed trains.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jiwei, an expert in fast-moving consumer goods marketing, said that as people's living standards get better, customers care more about healthy eating. This has reduced the market for instant noodles. Also, food delivery apps have grown quickly. They allow customers to easily and quickly buy different hot meals that are freshly made. These meals taste better and are fresher than instant noodles, and their prices are also becoming good.</p>
            <p>Li Wei, a food industry analyst, stated that young people have not given up on instant noodles. Instead, instant noodles have not kept up with young people's needs. New generations of customers are happy to pay 28 yuan for a cup of special coffee, but they are not interested in traditional instant noodles that cost less than 5 yuan.</p>
            <p>Zhu Danpeng, another Chinese food industry analyst, said that the decrease in the instant noodle market is a natural result of people buying more expensive and better quality products. In the future, companies need to invest more in making new products and making them healthier. If not, it will be hard for them to compete in the market.</p>

            <h1>Liu Fu Hotel Renovation: New Commercial Building to Be Completed in Q2 2026</h1>
            <p>Leofoo Tourism Group is working to grow its business by adding more properties. Today, they announced a topping-out ceremony for the Leofoo Hotel-style commercial office building. This building is in the center of the Songjiang Nanjing business area in Taipei. It used to be the Leofoo Hotel. The whole project is expected to be finished in the second quarter of 2026.</p>
            <p>Lai Chen-jung, the president of Leofoo Tourism Group, said in a press release that the building's floors have already been planned. Some floors will have restaurants with great views, spaces for banquets, and private chef services. This will bring back the dining experience of Leofoo Palace. Currently, foreign companies, technology companies, and brands looking for a main office are talking about renting spaces there.</p>
            <p>Lai Chen-jung pointed out that there are not many top-level A-grade offices with ESG certification available in the market. Also, the demand for these offices is getting stronger. The rent and number of deals for offices in the Songjiang Nanjing business area have gone up a lot. According to the Taipei City Department of Land, last year, the Songjiang Nanjing area had the most office rental deals among all main business areas. Also, rents there have increased by 15% in the last five years. Many important office building renovation projects are happening now. In the future, with many office buildings, this area will become very lively. It will attract many high-level office workers, which is expected to make property prices and rents in the surrounding areas go up.</p>
            <p>Leofoo explained that the new Leofoo Hotel-style commercial office building is built where the old Leofoo Hotel was. It will be a steel-frame office building with 6 underground floors and 21 above-ground floors. After the renovation, the total floor area will be 6,350 ping (about 20,992 square meters). It is being built by Hwa Hsiong Construction, the Taiwan branch of the big Japanese construction company Kumagai Gumi.</p>

            <h1>Debris on Magang Beach Affects Art Island Exhibition; County Government: Cleaned by End of Month</h1>
            <p>The Matsu Biennial (Art Island) is coming soon. People have reported that the beach near the art piece "The Sea is My Land" in Matsu Village, Nangan Township, is full of Styrofoam and bamboo. This not only looks bad but also makes it difficult for fishing boats to enter and leave. The Lienchiang County Department of Industrial Development said that the beach will be cleaned by the end of this month.</p>
            <p>Several Matsu villagers told the Central News Agency today that the beach next to Matsu Tianhou Temple is covered with a lot of items like Styrofoam, bamboo, and excavators, making it very messy. The art piece "The Sea is My Land" from the Art Island event is located there. It is also close to the famous Mazu Giant Statue. The items on the beach not only make it look bad for tourists and photos but also block the way for fishermen's small boats going out to sea. Villagers hope these items will be removed quickly.</p>
            <p>Chen Chih-wei, the head of Matsu Village, said that these items are used by fish farmers to build shelters. Once built, they are pulled by boats to an area near Chushui'ao Reservoir. The farmers first said they would only place a small amount of items, but in reality, they filled half of the beach. He has asked the farmers many times to remove the items quickly. However, they have given many excuses, like typhoons or stranded boats. This has made many villagers upset.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-feng, the Director of the Lienchiang County Department of Industrial Development, told the Central News Agency today that the Styrofoam and bamboo branches next to the art piece "The Sea is My Land" were placed there temporarily by legal fish farmers in the county starting in July. They promised to finish building their structures and clean the beach by the end of August. So, during the Matsu Biennial, the surrounding view of the art piece should not be affected.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-feng said that regarding the public's concerns about blocked access and the view around the Mazu Giant Statue, the county government will send people to check the site. Besides asking the farmers to finish building their shelters on time, they must also make sure that access is clear while the items are temporarily there. This is to ensure that fishermen's small boats can move in and out without problems.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-ping, Secretary of the Lienchiang County Government's Art Island Project Office, said that they had already asked the farmers through the Department of Industrial Development to clean the area. Regarding the public's comments that the area around the art piece "The Sea is My Land" looks bad, they will again ask the relevant departments to quickly remove the items on the beach. This is to make sure that people can enjoy the art without any problems.</p>
