            <h1>Akie Abe Visits Digital Lee Teng-hui Exhibition, Hopes AI Will Keep Shinzo Abe's Wisdom Alive</h1>
            <p>Akie Abe, the wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visited a special "Digital Lee Teng-hui" exhibition today. She used artificial intelligence (AI) technology to talk and take photos with a digital version of the late President Lee Teng-hui in Japanese. Akie Abe also shared that she is planning a "Digital Shinzo Abe" project. She hopes to use technology to share Shinzo Abe's life wisdom. She wants to finish this project by July next year.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Akie Abe, along with Lee An-ni (Chairperson of the Lee Teng-hui Foundation), King Min-ling (former National Policy Advisor to the Presidential Office), and Akio Yaita (CEO of the Indo-Pacific Strategic Think Tank), went to the National Taiwan Library. They visited the "PROTOTYPE: Mr. Democracy 2.0 Digital Lee Teng-hui Special Exhibition," which was organized by the Lee Teng-hui Foundation.</p>
            <p>Akie Abe looked at Lee Teng-hui's image on a screen. She talked to the AI Lee Teng-hui in Japanese and took a photo. Something funny happened during their talk. When Akie Abe introduced herself as Akie Abe, Shinzo Abe's wife, the AI only heard "Akie Abe." So, it replied, "You are not Shinzo Abe's wife, because Shinzo Abe's wife is called Akie Abe."</p>
            <p>After seeing the exhibition, Akie Abe told reporters that she did not know what the AI Lee Teng-hui was before. But after visiting, she found it very impressive. She liked that she could take pictures and talk with it. She also thought it helped many people understand Lee Teng-hui in different ways.</p>
            <p>Shinzo Abe passed away three years ago. Akie Abe is now thinking about a "Digital Shinzo Abe." She wants to use technology to remember and share Abe's life wisdom. Akie Abe said she hopes to finish it by July next year so everyone can see the AI Shinzo Abe.</p>
            <p>Akie Abe said that Lee An-ni is like her "Taiwanese older sister." She thinks Lee An-ni's ideas are very modern. Akie Abe said she learned a lot today and will take what she learned back to Japan.</p>
            <p>Lee An-ni said that the "Digital Lee Teng-hui" exhibition will be open for a long time. She hopes people will come to talk with Lee Teng-hui, take photos with him, listen to him sing, and see him "move" in pictures. The main goal of making AI Lee Teng-hui is to find what "immortality" truly means. The digital Lee Teng-hui exhibition is just the beginning, and there is more to do in the future.</p>

            <h1>Yacht Crew Member Drowns in Diving Accident Near Guishan Island</h1>
            <p>Today, a diving accident happened near Guishan Island in Yilan. A 33-year-old male yacht crew member, named Lee, sadly drowned while free diving. When he was pulled out of the water, he was not breathing and had no heartbeat. He was taken to shore and rushed to the hospital, but doctors could not save him. Police are still looking into exactly how the accident happened.</p>
            <p>A typhoon named "Kabajaja" is affecting the area. Because of this, the waves and wind along the northeast coast of Taiwan are getting stronger. Near noon today, the Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area Administration announced that Guishan Island would be closed from noon until September 23rd. This closure is a safety measure for two and a half days. Soon after this announcement, news came out about the drowning accident near Guishan Island.</p>
            <p>Near noon, the Coast Guard's First Patrol Area received a report. It said that a male crew member named Lee from a yacht drowned while diving in the waters near Guishan Island's "Turtle Tail" area. When he was rescued, he showed no signs of life. Another yacht helped take him to Wushih Port in Toucheng. He was then taken to the hospital, but it was too late to save him.</p>

            <h1>Vice President Hsiao Says Everyone's Help is Needed for Disaster Prevention on 921 Anniversary</h1>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said that 26 years ago today, Taiwan had the big 921 earthquake. The sadness from this disaster is still in many people's hearts. Because of this, every year September 21st is "National Disaster Prevention Day." She said that we need everyone's help to prevent disasters and protect our beloved homes together.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao wrote on Facebook that making September 21st "National Disaster Prevention Day" each year reminds everyone to learn from past events. It also reminds us to work harder on disaster prevention and be fully ready for the future.</p>
            <p>She said that a few days ago, everyone received a national warning drill on their phones. Also, the government has set up the "All-Society Defense Resilience Committee." This committee works on different ways to prepare for disasters. The government also continues to make important buildings stronger, teach disaster prevention in schools, and share experiences with other countries. All these efforts help Taiwan become better at dealing with disasters.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that the government has a handbook called "When Crisis Comes: Taiwan's National Security Guide." This handbook uses simple pictures and words to teach people how to prepare for disasters every day. It also teaches them how to stay calm if a disaster happens. This helps people make disaster prevention a part of their daily lives.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that we need everyone's power to protect our beloved homes from disasters. When a crisis happens, having the right information and being ready can greatly reduce harm. The more ready we are for disasters, the safer our lives will be, and our country will be stronger.</p>
