            <h1>ByteDance Chip Designers Move to Singapore Amid US-China Rivalry</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the matter, that last week, chip design employees of ByteDance suddenly found themselves moved to a department in Singapore. ByteDance is the Chinese company that owns TikTok, a popular short video app. Many of these employees work in Beijing or Shanghai.</p>
            <p>Two of the sources said that the employees learned about this change when they were moved to a new group on the company's internal messaging system. They then found out they would report to a unit in Singapore. Reports suggest this move could help ByteDance use advanced semiconductor technology even with the difficult relationship between the US and China.</p>
            <p>Many tech companies around the world, like ByteDance, are trying to develop their own special chips (ASICs). They want to rely less on big suppliers like Nvidia, which makes AI chips. However, since late 2023, US rules have stopped Chinese companies from asking TSMC to make advanced AI chips that are above a certain performance level.</p>
            <p>ByteDance is not currently asking TSMC to make chips for them. But last year, sources said that ByteDance was working with Broadcom, an American chip design company, to create an advanced AI processor. TSMC was planned to produce this chip.</p>
            <p>The sources did not say the name of the Singapore department where ByteDance's chip design employees were moved. Reuters also could not find out how many employees are now in this department. ByteDance did not reply when asked for comments.</p>
            <p>ByteDance has several large data centers in Singapore, and its CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is also from Singapore. Also, business records show that ByteDance created a company called Picoheart in Singapore in December 2023. This company became known last year for buying 9.5% of Innostar, a Chinese company that makes memory chips.</p>

            <h1>TBC to Bring Back 4 Channels Tonight, Hopes for More Talks</h1>
            <p>Today, the NCC announced that after two meetings to resolve a disagreement, Taiwan Broadband Communications (TBC) Group's cable TV will start showing 4 channels again, including Discovery. In response, Chunghwa Telecom (Chunghwa Group) said that both sides have temporarily agreed on a short-term license for the channels this year. They will put the interests of their viewers first. TBC also said they will continue to talk and discuss the matter.</p>
            <p>On August 6, TBC Group announced that its cable TV companies â€“ South Taoyuan, North TV, Xinhe, Jiyuan, and Qunjian â€“ would stop showing four channels. These were Discovery (CH19), GTV One (CH27), GTV Variety Show (CH28), and TVBS Happy Channel (CH42).</p>
            <p>The NCC explained today that the five companies that asked for help, including South Taoyuan, and Global Digital Media, which belongs to Chunghwa Group, worked hard to agree during their meetings. After many discussions, they reached a deal. So, today, the four channels â€“ GTV One, GTV Variety Show, TVBS Happy Channel, and Discovery â€“ will be broadcast again.</p>
            <p>TBC said that they thank the government authority for understanding that the main issue was "the legal right to broadcast channels." They also thanked the authority for helping to arrange the license. TBC will continue to talk about the issues.</p>
            <p>Chunghwa Group also stated in a press release that because the NCC actively helped them find a solution, both sides have temporarily agreed on a short-term license for the channels this year. TBC has promised to start broadcasting the four channels again by 6 PM on September 5.</p>
            <p>Chunghwa Group thanked the NCC for actively helping to solve the problem of the channels stopping. This help was important for healthy industry growth and protecting consumer rights. Chunghwa Group will do its best as a channel agent. It will work to keep the market for channel licenses fair. It will also continue to work hard to meet the different viewing needs of various groups of people. It is committed to helping the industry grow well and ensuring the company continues to succeed.</p>

            <h1>"The Prank King - Chiu Wang She (New Play)" Returns, Showing Taiwanese Spirit</h1>
            <p>After eight years, the Taiwanese stage play "The Prank King - New Version of Chiu Wang She" will return to the theater. Wang Rong-yu, who won a National Award for Arts, and Chi Wei-ran worked together to write and direct it. Wang Rong-yu said that "The Prank King" shows what Taiwanese people are like. He said it means "always being yourself."</p>
            <p>Wang Rong-yu said that Golden Bough Theatre made this Taiwanese play in 2017 with a goal: to show what "Taiwanese people" are like. He said it means, "No matter what goals or dreams you have, you should always be yourself, like unique flowers blooming." Wang Rong-yu added that "The Prank King" uses humor to connect with stories from our ancestors a hundred years ago. He said, "Maybe future generations will also use this way to understand the problems and confusion of our time."</p>
            <p>The story of "The Prank King - New Version of Chiu Wang She" is about Chiu Wang She, a very smart but carefree man. He finds people's weaknesses and plays tricks on them in his village. He faces challenges like a bet with a government official, the tricks of Bai Zai Qi, and a big fight between two groups (Zhangzhou and Quanzhou) that could start at any moment. He gets through these dangers, which are mixed with old family rivalries and love. In the end, the people who love each other get to be together.</p>
            <p>Golden Bough Theatre's Taiwanese play "The Prank King - New Version of Chiu Wang She" will be performed from September 19 to September 21. It will take place at the Main Performance Hall of the Taiwan Traditional Theatre Center.</p>
