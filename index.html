            <h1>Disagreement on New Law for Sharing Money: Chen Chi-mai Says Everyone Should Be Fair</h1>
            <p>On August 30, the Ministry of Finance announced how much money each city and county will get next year, based on a new law. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai said that everyone should look at all the details, like the number of older people and pollution levels. He believes people should think about others and make sure the numbers are clear and fair.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai spoke at an event and was asked about the money distribution. He said that the new law for sharing money, which the Legislative Yuan passed, will make the gap between rich and poor cities bigger. It will also make the balance between cities and countryside worse. He pointed out that Taipei and New Taipei together get a very large part of the money, about one-fifth of the total.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai thinks that when the government talks with local cities and counties, everyone should be understanding. He said that some cities are getting a lot more money this time. He suggested that all information should be shared openly, including the percentage of older people, land size, and pollution from industries. He believes everyone should look at these things fairly and openly, considering others, to make sure the money is shared correctly.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai explained that Kaohsiung and Taichung have similar populations. However, Kaohsiung's share of money increased by only 52%, while Taichung's increased by about 66%. This means Taichung received billions more than Kaohsiung. The biggest problem with the new law is that it does not consider things like land size or the extra costs caused by industries, such as pollution.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai gave pollution as an example, saying it is very unfair. He asked the government to consider all three types of funding together: the main money shared, general grants, and project grants. He said it's not fair that Taipei already gets a big piece of the pie, and then wants to take more from the other grants. This is very unfair.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai added that Taipei's subway system has been developed for a long time. Now, when Kaohsiung and Tainan are starting to build their subways, the money for the south is getting smaller. He said this makes the difference between the north and south even larger, which is worrying. He feels like no one is listening to their concerns, and this heavy financial burden is very unfair.</p>

            <h1>Han Kuo-yu Meets US Senator: Political Parties Agree to Increase Defense Budget</h1>
            <p>On August 30, Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu and Vice President Chiang Chi-chen met with US Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker. Han Kuo-yu stated that political parties in Taiwan have agreed to support increasing Taiwan's defense budget to more than 3% of its GDP next year. He added that Taiwan will work towards the goal of 5%, similar to NATO member countries.</p>
            <p>US Senator Roger Wicker, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taiwan on August 29. On Saturday morning, Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu had a breakfast meeting with them. Vice President Chiang Chi-chen and lawmakers from different parties, including Chen Yong-kang, Hsu Chiao-hsin (KMT), Chen Kuan-ting (DPP), and Lin Yi-chun (TPP), also joined the meeting. AIT Director Stephen Young was also present.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that even though different political parties in Taiwan have some different ideas on defense and foreign policy, they have found common ground. They all fully support defense and foreign affairs work and want to make the partnership between Taiwan and the US stronger. They also support increasing Taiwan's defense budget to more than 3% of its GDP next year, with a future goal of reaching 5%, like NATO members.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu explained that Taiwan is going through an important time. He said it is important to fully understand how the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders think, so Taiwan can deal with challenges carefully. He noted that after the war between Russia and Ukraine, Taiwan faces more pressure from China. Taiwan will work to get more support from other countries. In this difficult situation, talking to other countries through the parliament is very important. He hopes that the US and other friendly countries will continue to support Taiwan with real actions.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu sincerely thanked Senator Wicker and Senator Fischer for their strong support and friendship for Taiwan. He said this shows that Taiwan should not be ignored by other countries. The more international support Taiwan gets, the safer it will be.</p>
            <p>Vice President Chiang Chi-chen thanked the US for its support across different political parties. He remembered serving in Kinmen during the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, which made him deeply understand how important it is to improve national security, make Taiwan stronger, and keep good relationships with allied countries in the region. He said Taiwan will keep working to improve its ability to defend itself and keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Chiang Chi-chen also thanked AIT for always working to help Taiwan and the US talk and work together. He hopes that they will continue to work more closely in the future.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan mentioned that lawmakers from different parties discussed issues related to Taiwan and the US with the visiting group. Chen Yong-kang suggested improving military discussions and training between Taiwan and the US. Chen Kuan-ting talked about delays in getting weapons from the US. Hsu Chiao-hsin emphasized the importance of preventing conflict and talking to the public. Lin Yi-chun explained that the Taiwan People's Party cares about foreign policy and defense and always puts the country's interests first.</p>

            <p>Officials in India said today that at least 11 more people have died in Jammu and Kashmir, a region in northern India. This includes 4 children. Heavy, record-breaking rain recently caused floods and landslides there.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that a landslide happened on August 27 on a path to the Vaishno Devi Hindu temple in the Jammu area. This event, caused by heavy rain, had already killed 41 people.</p>
            <p>Jammu and Kashmir has been hit by very strong monsoon storms since August 26. These storms have caused a lot of damage, with strong floods destroying bridges and filling homes with water.</p>
            <p>Local emergency officials told Agence France-Presse that 11 people died last night in the Ramban and Reasi areas because of heavy rain and landslides. One 5-year-old child is still missing, trapped under the debris.</p>
            <p>The Indian weather office said that the heavy rains have broken records in two places in the Jammu region.</p>
