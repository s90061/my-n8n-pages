            <h1>3 Years of Navy Service: Witnessing the Legendary History of the Yukikaze and Danyang Ships</h1>
            <p>Huang Zhengxing, a fruit farmer from Changhua, was born when Taiwan was ruled by Japan. When he did his compulsory military service, he joined the navy. He was sent to the destroyer "Yukikaze," a ship that Japan gave to the Republic of China after World War II. He became one of the last sailors on this ship, which was later called "Danyang," and he helped protect Taiwan's waters.</p>
            <p>It has been 80 years since World War II finished. A Japanese film named "Yukikaze YUKIKAZE" came out on August 15. It shows the story of the Japanese navy ship Yukikaze during the war. The movie ends with the captain, acted by Takenouchi Yutaka, saying that the Yukikaze would be given to the United Nations. In real history, the Yukikaze was the only ship of its type in the Japanese navy that survived from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the war's end. After the war, the navy of the Republic of China received the Yukikaze and changed its name to "Danyang" (ship number DD-12). In the 1950s, this ship became a very important one for the navy.</p>
            <p>Chen Lihang studies Taiwan's history during Japanese rule. In August, he went to Japan for a ceremony to remember people who stayed in Siberia after World War II. He also saw the "Yukikaze" movie. He said the movie was special because it showed that soldiers wanted to "live and go home." The part about the Republic of China is only at the very end. It shows the ship's anchor, which is still there, and a sign that talks about the Republic of China Navy.</p>
            <p>Huang Zhengxing was born in 1943, when Japan ruled Taiwan. He finished school at Yongjing Agricultural School. When it was time for his required military service, he chose the navy. For a farming family, this was not ideal because navy service was one year longer than army service (the navy and air force served 3 years, and the army served 2 years at that time). But then he remembered that food in villages was often not good. He also knew a person from a nearby village who became "big and strong" while serving in the navy. So, he thought that being in the navy might be good.</p>
            <p>In October 1963, Huang Zhengxing joined the navy for three years. He was in the 94th group of navy ship soldiers. He went to the Zuoying naval school for four months of training. They divided the soldiers into different groups for their jobs on the ship, like gunnery, telecommunications, mines, and communications. He was in the gunnery group. Every morning, they had four hours of special lessons. In the afternoon, they spent two hours marching and doing other exercises.</p>
            <p>Today, Huang Zhengxing runs a farm where he grows grapes. The time for picking grapes just finished. But his family is still working hard. They are cutting the grape vines and getting the land ready for next year's grapes.</p>
            <p>"Training was easier than working on the farm," Huang Zhengxing told CNA. He remembered his time in the military. He said that the food in the army was much better than the food his family ate in the village.</p>
            <p>As a gunnery soldier, Huang Zhengxing was in charge of the ammunition storage on the Danyang ship. The Danyang had six places to store ammunition for its main guns, smaller guns, anti-aircraft guns, small weapons, and handguns. His leader told him this job was very important. Every afternoon, he had to check if the temperature in these rooms was over 34 degrees Celsius. If it was too hot, he had to report it to the ship's second-in-command. If the temperature was too high, there were sprinklers to cool down the ammunition rooms.</p>
            <p>Huang Zhengxing explained that only once did he find an ammunition room that was hotter than 34 degrees. He told his captain, who said, "It's fine if it's only hot for one day." So, they did not need to use the sprinklers.</p>
            <p>Huang Zhengxing said that the soldiers on the ship called the Danyang "Old Dan." About 200 people worked on the ship. They were put into different groups for things like sailing, engines, radios, signals, and guns. Because he was a gunnery soldier, he was in the gunnery group, which had about 10 soldiers. The group leader was also their squad leader. In a fight, his job was to help move and load the big bullets for the cannons. When there was no fighting, their main port was Zuoying. They would go to places like Magong, Keelung, and Kinmen to patrol. They also protected ships carrying supplies to Nansha and Kinmen. He does not remember ever going to Matsu.</p>
            <p>Huang Zhengxing said that in the 1960s, the navy mostly used "Yang-class" destroyers made in America. The Danyang ship looked old compared to these newer ships. It was going to be retired because it was getting old and parts were breaking. One of its three boilers broke, and they did not fix it. So, when the ship sailed, it could only use two boilers, and its top speed was about 20 knots. After a ceremony for the Danyang ship's 13th birthday in October 1965, it never sailed again. They started taking off all the ammunition and equipment. He said, "They took it away using more than 30 trucks."</p>
            <p>Huang Zhengxing remembered that the Danyang ship stayed in Zuoying and was used for training for a few years, but it never left the port again. After that, he was moved to another ship, a frigate called "Huashan," which America had just given to Taiwan. He worked on the Huashan ship for about six to seven months. Then, in October 1966, he finished his military service.</p>

            <h1>Kim Jong Un Meets Putin, Promises Full Help to Russia</h1>
            <p>North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, said today that he will fully support Russia's President, Vladimir Putin. He said he wants to "help Moscow as much as I can." Putin thanked North Korea because they sent soldiers to help Russia fight in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that this meeting took place in Beijing. It happened during an event that celebrated 80 years since "China's victory in the war against Japan and the end of World War II."</p>
            <p>Before their meeting, Putin and Kim Jong Un also stood with China's President Xi Jinping at a big military parade. This was the first time that the leaders of these three countries were together since the start of the Cold War.</p>
            <p>After the parade, Kim Jong Un and Putin went in the same car to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. They had a private meeting there.</p>
            <p>Kim Jong Un told Putin, "If I can do anything for you and the people of Russia, or if I should, I believe it is my duty as a brother."</p>
            <p>Putin spoke in Russian and called Kim Jong Un "dear State Affairs Commissioner." He sent his best wishes.</p>
            <p>Putin said, "Lately, the relationship between our two countries has become special, full of trust, and friendly." He praised the special forces from North Korea who went to Ukraine to help the Russian army. He said, "Your soldiers showed great courage and no fear."</p>
            <p>He also said, "I want to say that we will never forget what your soldiers and their families have given up."</p>

            <h1>Japan's Government Bond Rates and Global Gold Prices Reach New Highs; Most Asian Stocks Fall</h1>
            <p>Today, people continued to sell government bonds in Asia. Japan's 30-year government bond interest rate went up to its highest ever. People are worried about how countries like the U.S. and Japan will handle their money. So, the price of gold around the world also reached a new high. Most stock markets in Asia finished the day with lower prices.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Japan's ruling party, the LDP, lost badly in the Senate election in July. On September 2nd, Morioka Yu, a top leader in the LDP, said he wanted to quit his job because of this. Now, people who invest in Japan are also worried that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba might have to leave his job soon.</p>
            <p>Most main stock markets in Asia closed lower today. The Tokyo market went down by 0.88%, and the Shanghai market also went down by 1.16%.</p>
            <p>Japan's government bond interest rate for 30 years reached a new high of 3.29%. The 20-year bond rate also reached 2.69%, which is the highest it has been since 1999.</p>
            <p>Stephen Innes, a money expert at SPI Asset Management, wrote in a report: "If Japan's 30-year government bond interest rate goes higher than 3.25%, it could be much worse than the political problems in Japan."</p>
            <p>Innes also said that if Japan's government bond interest rate goes over a key number, "it will not only make people who save money in Japan worried. It will also make insurance companies, pension funds, and people who manage money around the world change how they invest. When these changes start to spread, stock markets everywhere will be affected."</p>
            <p>Also, the U.S. 30-year government bond interest rate briefly went above 5%. The U.K.'s 30-year government bond rate reached its highest point since 1998. France's 30-year government bond rate also went up to 4.5%, which has not happened since 2009.</p>
            <p>People who invest are still putting their money into gold because it is a safe choice. This caused the price of gold worldwide to reach a record high of $3546.96 per ounce for a short time.</p>
