            <h1>Taitung Recall Movement Raises Public Awareness, Showing a Different Political Face</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, reporter Lu Ta-cheng, Taitung County, July 27th) The recall case in Taitung has made local people more aware of their rights as citizens. Not only young people took part actively, but also many "political newcomers" from doctors, academics, cultural workers, and foreign missionaries came forward. They showed a new way of taking part in politics, which was different from before.</p>
            <p>This recall movement lasted for half a year. Besides political parties and politicians, many new faces appeared. Sometimes, one person stood on the street holding a sign. Sometimes, a group of volunteers greeted people in the rain. Some even gave speeches on stage. This was very different from the noisy election events in the past. It showed a new type of public action.</p>
            <p>Hung Tsung-kai, who is now the director of the Executive Yuan's Eastern Joint Services Center, said that many young people he had never seen in elections appeared in this recall movement. He had run for Taitung Mayor twice for the Democratic Progressive Party but did not win. Also, most members of the recall headquarters did not know each other. The volunteers who gave speeches and took part in activities were different each time. This showed a wide and natural way of getting people involved in society.</p>
            <p>Chen Chia-bin, the co-leader and spokesperson for this recall case, owns a convenience store. He had never been involved in politics before. But he decided to go out and became one of the main people pushing for the movement.</p>
            <p>Not just young people, but also foreign monks, university professors, doctors, and bookstore owners came out. They asked people to vote more. This showed that people from many different areas were becoming more aware.</p>
            <p>Brother Augustin, who is 89 years old and from the Bethlehem Mission Society, became a Taiwanese citizen. He said when he signed for the second stage that Taiwan is his home. Even if he was weak, he would stand up for his home. After he voted yesterday afternoon, he said he was very happy and thankful to vote in Taiwan. He said that in Switzerland, voting is a duty, and if you don't vote, you get a fine. "Good citizens should care about their country's matters. They cannot ignore them. So, you must vote. This is our duty."</p>
            <p>Dr. Liu Han-ting, the head of Hematology and Oncology at Taitung Christian Hospital, rarely took part in public political activities before. After the recall case entered its second stage in March this year, he started to ask people to sign often on social media. From April, he also went out to give speeches and spoke at small rallies. He said that if he only focused on hospital work and did not care about social matters, "that would be a debt to God."</p>
            <p>Professor Tseng Shih-chieh, who used to be the vice president of National Taitung University and the dean of the College of Education, wrote a letter and posted on Facebook. He asked his students to "help me finish my retirement gift - to join the second stage of signing." After he joined the public movement, his social media followers quickly grew by 1,500 people. He told a CNA reporter that Dr. Jane Goodall, a famous environmentalist from the UK, once told him: "When everyone works together, they can make a change." He strongly believes that small drops of water will finally become a big flow, changing Taiwan and also Taitung. (Editor: Huang Shih-ya) July 27, 2025.</p>
