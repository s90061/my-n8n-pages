            <h1>Northern Taiwan to See 38-Degree Heat; Tropical Depression May Become a Typhoon, But Will Not Affect Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that today and tomorrow, it will be very hot. Temperatures in northern Taiwan could reach 38 degrees Celsius. A tropical depression is slowly getting stronger in the South China Sea. Before August 30, it has a 60% chance of becoming a typhoon. However, it will not affect Taiwan. Next week, there will be other weather systems in the far eastern sea of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>What is a High Temperature Warning?</p>
            <p>The Weather Bureau's "High Temperature Information" defines "high temperature" as when the highest temperature on the ground goes above 36 degrees Celsius. Based on how high the temperature is and how long it lasts, there are three warning levels: yellow, orange, and red.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column "Xie Tian Ji Jiao Shi" for the Meteorological Applications Promotion Foundation. He said that the newest European model shows that today and tomorrow, most areas will be sunny with some clouds. It will be very hot, with northern Taiwan reaching 38 degrees. Around noon, the UV index will be dangerous. People should protect themselves from the sun and avoid heatstroke. The Hengchun Peninsula, Hualien, and Taitung might have some short local rains. In the afternoon, mountain areas might have local showers or thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>For temperatures, Wu Der-rong said that today, northern Taiwan will be 24 to 38 degrees, central Taiwan 23 to 37 degrees, southern Taiwan 24 to 35 degrees, and eastern Taiwan 21 to 35 degrees.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also said that the newest European model shows that from August 31 to September 2, there will be a bit more moisture from the south. Most areas will be cloudy with some sun. Temperatures will drop slightly, but northern Taiwan will still be warm. Eastern Taiwan and Pingtung might have some short local rains. In the afternoon, mountain areas might have local showers or thunderstorms, and sometimes these might spread to some flat areas. People should be careful of strong local thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong stated that on September 3 and 4, most areas will be sunny with some clouds. It will be very hot. Around noon, the UV index will be dangerous. People should protect themselves from the sun and avoid heatstroke. The Hengchun Peninsula, Hualien, and Taitung might have some short local rains. In the afternoon, there will be local showers or thunderstorms, mostly in the mountains. People still need to be careful of strong local thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that the newest European ensemble model shows that a tropical depression is slowly developing in the South China Sea. The chance of it becoming a typhoon before August 30 has increased slightly to 60%. Although it is similar to a swordfish (in its shape on the map), its strength is much weaker. It will not affect Taiwan. He also mentioned that the newest model shows that next week, other tropical systems will be active in the far eastern sea of Taiwan. The Northwest Pacific is still a common area for typhoons.</p>

            <h1>Dow Jones Reaches New High, TSMC's ADR Falls; Experts See Smaller Stocks Doing Better</h1>
            <p>The Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes in the US stock market reached new record highs. However, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) American Depositary Receipts (ADR) went down by 0.43%. Experts believe that the Taiwan stock market will continue to move up and down at a high level. The GreTai Securities Market index reached a new high this Thursday. Smaller and medium-sized stocks are expected to do quite well.</p>
            <p>On August 28, the Taiwan stock market opened lower, moved up and down, and then closed lower. It dropped by 283.45 points, ending at 24236.45 points. This means it tested the 5-day moving average of 24220 points again.</p>
            <p>Because the US updated its second-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data and the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia reported good earnings, the main indexes on Wall Street ended higher.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 71.67 points, or 0.16%, closing at 45636.90 points. The S&P 500 index went up by 20.46 points, or 0.32%, ending at 6501.86 points. The Nasdaq index increased by 115.02 points, or 0.53%, closing at 21705.16 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose by 28.44 points, or 0.49%, closing at 5853.05 points.</p>
            <p>On August 28, LED maker Fuchuan announced that its subsidiary, Bright Point Investment, sold shares in Edison Opto. The total amount from this sale was 168.278 million NT dollars. Also, an earlier announcement said that its subsidiary sold shares in PlayNitride Inc. for 456.709 million NT dollars. In total, selling these two types of shares brought in 624.987 million NT dollars.</p>
            <p>On August 28, the Financial Supervisory Commission announced the profit and loss figures for the insurance industry. In the first seven months of this year, life insurance companies made 23.2 billion NT dollars. This is a big drop of 92.3% compared to the same period last year.</p>
            <p>On August 28, Dehchen Chemical Corp., a hot-melt adhesive company, held an online meeting. The company said that its factories in Vietnam and India cannot meet the demand. Its second factory in India will start making products this year. The board of directors also decided to put more money into its Vietnamese subsidiary to build a second factory there.</p>
            <p>On August 28, solar energy company TSEC Corporation announced that Mr. Kung Ming-hsin, a representative of a corporate director and the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, has resigned. This change will take effect on August 31. TSEC said that Mr. Kung resigned because he will become the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>
