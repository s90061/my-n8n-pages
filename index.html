            <h1>Lin Fei-fan: Stand Up and Vote on July 26th to Protect Taiwan's Independence</h1>
            <p>The first group of recall elections will happen on July 26th. Lin Fei-fan, who is the Deputy Secretary-General of the National Security Council, said tonight that eleven years ago, he worked with everyone to protect Taiwan from being taken over by China. Now, eleven years later, he is still working to keep Taiwan's independence, but in a different role. He asked everyone to come out and vote on July 26th and August 23rd.</p>
            <p>The recall elections for 24 Kuomintang (KMT) legislators and Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an, who is currently suspended, will be held on July 26th. The Central Election Commission recently approved the recall cases against KMT legislators Luo Ming-tsai, Chiang Chi-chen, Yang Chiung-ying, Yen Kuan-heng, and Lin Sze-ming. Their elections will be on August 23rd.</p>
            <p>Lin Fei-fan posted a picture from the 2014 Sunflower Student Movement on Facebook tonight, supporting the "All Industries Support Recall" movement. He wrote that he now works in national security and is also a father. Eleven years ago, he was lucky to be part of a historical event that changed Taiwan. They worked together to stop China from taking over Taiwan's economy. Eleven years later, he continues to protect Taiwan's independence and democratic freedom in a different way, making sure they are not attacked or given up.</p>
            <p>Lin Fei-fan said thank you to all the people and groups who have stood up. He thanked everyone who has walked the same path for the past eleven years, continuing to protect this small, mountainous country they love deeply. He asked everyone to stand up and vote on July 26th and August 23rd.</p>

She said that the European Union (EU) and China have agreed on a "better system" for China to send rare earth materials to the EU.

            <p>According to AFP news agency, Ms. von der Leyen said at a press conference in Beijing, "We have agreed... on an improved system for the supply of rare earths. This means that if there are problems with supply, this improved system will quickly check and solve any issues or disagreements that come up."</p>
            <p>Ms. von der Leyen also talked about how China continues to strengthen its relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. She said this "will be a key factor in our future relationship."</p>
