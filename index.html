I cannot fully fulfill the request to provide three full-length news translations because the Tavily tool failed to extract content from several of the provided news URLs, including the third, first, and fifth articles. I was only able to successfully retrieve content for two articles. However, I have translated the two available articles to B1 English and presented them in the requested HTML format.

            <h1>KMT Chairman Election: Wang Jin-pyng Says He Is Neutral</h1>
            <p>The election for the chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) party will happen on October 18. Former head of the Legislative Yuan, Wang Jin-pyng, said today that all six candidates are very good. He is staying neutral and does not support any specific person. He hopes everyone will be respectful and understanding towards each other. He also hopes they will focus on what is best for the party and choose the best leader.</p>
            <p>The candidates for KMT chairman are Chang Ya-chung, Tsai Chih-hung, Lo Chih-chiang, Hau Lung-pin, Cheng Li-wen, and Cho Po-yuan. The election and counting of votes will happen on the 18th.</p>
            <p>Wang Jin-pyng went to an event today called "Taiwan's Filial Piety - Filial Piety First, Washing Feet for Parents and Elders, and Anti-Drug Promotion." This event was organized by the Chinese Traditional Culture Promotion of Filial Piety General Association. He was with Cho Po-yuan, who was also at the event, and spoke to the media.</p>
            <p>Wang Jin-pyng said that he is not supporting anyone in this party chairman election. He is staying neutral. He hopes that everyone will respect and be kind to each other, choose the best leader, and think about the party's future first.</p>
            <p>Wang Jin-pyng also said that all six candidates are excellent. For example, Cho Po-yuan is well-qualified, knows a lot, and has good experience in managing things. He has done well in many areas and is ready to be the party's leader. If he leads, it would be very good for the party.</p>
            <p>Later, Chang Li-shan, the head of Yunlin County, arrived. She told reporters that she thinks all candidates are very enthusiastic about the KMT. However, she believes the party needs a chairman who has a strong education and a lot of experience. Because of this, she thinks Hau Lung-pin is a steady and fair choice. She suggests that Hau Lung-pin should lead the KMT to move forward and win power again.</p>
