            <h1>United Nations Summit Eve: UK, Australia, Canada Officially Recognize State of Palestine</h1>
            <p>(London, September 21, Central News Agency) A big meeting will soon happen at the United Nations in New York. This meeting is about the "two-state solution" for Israel and Palestine. Today, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada have officially recognized Palestine as a country. They did this even though Israel and the United States do not agree. Portugal is also expected to do the same later today.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote on X (a social media site) that "Today, the UK officially recognizes the State of Palestine. This is to bring back hope for peace for both Palestinians and Israelis, and to help the two-state solution happen."</p>
            <p>Also, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement that Australia "officially recognizes the independent and sovereign State of Palestine."</p>
            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also made a statement. He said, "Canada recognizes the State of Palestine. We want to work together to make a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel."</p>
            <p>Among the G7 countries (Group of Seven big economies), the UK and Canada are the first to recognize Palestine as a country. It is expected that France and other countries will also recognize Palestine at the United Nations summit.</p>
            <p>However, Israel and the United States do not want Palestine to be recognized. They think this action will make extremist groups stronger. They also believe it would be like rewarding Hamas, a Palestinian armed group.</p>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked southern Israel. They killed more than a thousand people and took Israelis as hostages. This started the war between Israel and Hamas.</p>

            <h1>Yu Ba Cup National Badminton Competition: Sixth-Grader Liu Xin-yu Wins Two Titles in Different Age Categories</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 21, Central News Agency reporter Li Jian-zhong) The 4th Yu Ba Cup National Badminton Championship is happening for the first time this year at the Taipei City Gymnasium. Almost 2000 players are taking part. Liu Xin-yu, a sixth-grade student from Minquan Elementary School in Kaohsiung City, played in harder groups than her age. She won two first-place titles: one in the boys' singles for sixth graders and another in the girls' singles for junior high school students.</p>
            <p>Tai Tzu-ying, who was once the best female badminton player in the world and a famous Taiwanese athlete, also went to Minquan Elementary School in Kaohsiung. Because Liu Xin-yu is so good, people call her "Tai Tzu-ying's younger schoolmate."</p>
            <p>Liu Xin-yu is a sixth grader. She is shy and doesn't talk much when she's not playing. But on the court, she is very strong and confident. She plays like someone older and stays calm. In this competition, she played in the sixth-grade boys' singles and also in the junior high girls' singles. She won both titles and everyone watched her.</p>
            <p>Liu Xin-yu's father talked to the media about her daily training. He said, "We train for five days every week. This helps our child keep her love for badminton. It also teaches her to aim high and always try to get better."</p>
            <p>Mr. Liu stressed that even with many hours of training each week, "our most important job is to protect our child from getting hurt. Only if she is healthy can she play for a longer time."</p>
            <p>Since it started, the Yu Ba Cup has always tried to be the best place for young badminton players to compete. It encourages players from different places and age groups to play against each other and improve together.</p>
            <p>The winners and runner-ups from all groups in this competition will be asked to join the "Sunli Badminton with You Elementary and Family Age Group Competition." This event will be held at the Taichung Chaoma Sports Center. This gives the young players another chance to play and experience different kinds of sports events.</p>

            <h1>Gong Ming-hsin Shares 4 Main Policy Goals; Over 60 Billion NT Dollars Planned for Traditional Industries in Two Years</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 21, Central News Agency reporter Lu Yan-ci) Minister of Economic Affairs, Gong Ming-hsin, talked about four main plans for the future. First, he wants to make energy and water supplies stronger and more reliable. Second, he will support small and medium businesses and traditional industries. For these, he expects to spend more than 60 billion New Taiwan Dollars in the next two years. Third, he plans to grow special industries like military technology. Fourth, he wants to make Taiwan's economy strong everywhere in the world by using the semiconductor industry's global reach.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin was interviewed on the TV show "Digital Taiwan," which was shown tonight. Talking about his future plans, Gong Ming-hsin said the first is to make energy and water systems stronger. He said that while the government cannot stop natural disasters from happening, it can make sure that losses are small and recovery is fast.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin explained that the second main plan is to help small and medium businesses and traditional industries. This will be very important. He stressed that semiconductors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are important, but Taiwan's basic strength comes from its traditional industries and small businesses.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin also said that a special budget plan has been sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. This plan is called "Central Government Special Budget for Strengthening Economic, Social, and National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations." It includes 46 billion NT dollars to support industries. Also, for the regular yearly budget, the "Diverse Revitalization and Development Plan for Small and Medium Enterprises" has about 10.9 billion NT dollars this year. Next year, it might be more than 10 billion NT dollars. In total, over 60 billion NT dollars will be used in the next two years to help traditional industries and small and medium businesses.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin said he has told people that "money flow and orders must not stop." He wants to help traditional industries and small and medium businesses as much as possible. This includes improving their workers' skills and technology. He wants all kinds of businesses to start using AI to reduce the need for workers in production and customer service. He also hopes to train 200,000 AI experts within two years.</p>
            <p>For other future plans, Gong Ming-hsin said the third point is about industries that are special to Taiwan, like developing military industries. He will ask different organizations to work together to do this well. For example, he said that drones can be used for both military and civilian purposes, which gives Taiwan a great chance. Currently, the Ministry of National Defense plans to buy up to 100,000 drones. This gives Taiwanese companies a chance to get experience. Once the supply chain is complete, they will be able to handle big international orders.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin said that the fourth point is about semiconductors and AI. He will follow President Lai Ching-te's idea of "starting in Taiwan, building a global presence, and selling to the whole world." By setting up the semiconductor industry all over the world, he wants Taiwan to become an economic power that never sleeps.</p>
            <p>Also, the host Hsieh Chin-ho asked how the Ministry of Economic Affairs will help TSMC invest in the United States, given that US President Trump is making things difficult for them. Gong Ming-hsin directly stated that Taiwan is very good at semiconductors, including TSMC and other companies. At this time and in the near future, there is no replacement for Taiwan's leadership. However, Taiwan needs to deal with many things it cannot control. But for the things it can control, if Taiwan always stays ahead with new technology, there will be less to worry about. This is why the government wants to plan ahead for things like silicon photonics, quantum technology, and robots.</p>
