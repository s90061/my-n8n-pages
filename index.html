            <h1>Singapore Critical Infrastructure Hit by Cyberattack, Experts Suspect China Link</h1>
            <p>Singapore announced yesterday that its key computer systems were attacked. Security experts believe the attackers are a spy group connected to China. Authorities are dealing with the situation.</p>
            <p>K. Shanmugam, who is Singapore's Minister for National Security and Home Affairs, said in a speech: "UNC3886 is a serious danger to us. It could harm our country's safety. It targets important places that provide necessary services and valuable strategic goals."</p>
            <p>Shanmugam did not give details about the attack or what happened because of security risks.</p>
            <p>Mandiant, a security company owned by Google, said that UNC3886 is "a spy group linked to China." This group has attacked defense, technology, and phone companies in the US and Asia before.</p>
            <p>China always says it does not do cyber spying.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported this week that Taiwan's computer chip industry and investment experts have been targets of many cyber spy attacks. These attacks are believed to be from hackers connected to China.</p>
            <p>Researchers from Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company, said that at least three different groups linked to China did these attacks. They happened mostly from March to June this year, and some might still be happening.</p>
