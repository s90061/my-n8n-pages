The Sports Department of the Ministry of Education held a training event for indigenous baseball and softball coaches today. Lawmaker Chen Ying said this program helps retired players find steady jobs and gives coaches better benefits. This shows that the government cares about baseball.

The program started seven years ago with a budget of about NT$17 million. Now, it has grown to NT$105 million. Coaches' salaries have also gone up from NT$29,000 to over NT$60,000. Their salaries will also increase when government workers' salaries go up.

The program also gives different salaries to A and B level coaches, so they can earn more in the future. This plan helps many retired players get good, steady jobs with much better pay. This also shows how much the government values baseball and helps coaches get better rights.

**Baozhong Township Mayor Found to Have Bullied Staff, Case Sent to Control Yuan**

Last year, the Yunlin County Government received a complaint that Baozhong Township Mayor Chen Chien-Ming had bullied someone at work. After looking into it, the county government decided that the bullying did happen. Now, the case has been sent to the Control Yuan for review.

Mayor Chen Chien-Ming said he respects the decision. However, he claimed that the person who complained admitted to giving false information in a criminal case, and the court found them guilty.

The mayor thinks the county government's actions were not careful and that they did not use the evidence he gave them. He believes that the Control Yuan will be fair. The county government said that six out of seven bullying complaints were true. These included making the person clean a cemetery, not letting them transfer jobs, trying to punish them twice for the same thing, asking them to take a lower-level job, and not letting them use air conditioning or talk to others in the town hall. The county government stated that these were not single events but happened often, showing that the mayor intended to bully.

**Popular Imported Chocolate Has Too Much Preservative, 160 KG Sent Back**

"Dubai Chocolate," a popular imported chocolate, was found to have too much preservative and cannot be sold. It came from the United Arab Emirates. A total of 160 kilograms of this chocolate will be sent back or destroyed at the border.

Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its latest list of products that failed border checks. There were six products that did not meet the standards, including a Chinese plant extract, dried chili from Nigeria, and frozen fish from Indonesia. These products had too many pesticides or other problems, and all of them were sent back or destroyed.

The FDA found that the "VIGO KUNAFA CHOCOLATE" from the United Arab Emirates had too much dehydroacetic acid, a preservative. The amount found was 0.05 grams per kilogram, which is more than allowed. This led to all 160 kilograms being sent back or destroyed. Because of this, the FDA will now check 20% to 50% of this importer's products, instead of the usual 2% to 10%.
