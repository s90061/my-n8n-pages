Prosecutors in Changhua have finished investigating a case involving a sea patrol officer. This officer, surnamed Lin, and five others are accused of working with illegal cigarette sellers and getting money unfairly. Officer Lin made over 3 million NTD from these crimes. He could go to jail for 15 years for taking bribes.

On July 10th, the Changhua District Prosecutors Office announced the news. In 2023, prosecutor Tsai Chi-hsiao was looking into a case and found that a police officer was using police systems to check car information for certain people. This made them think the officer was helping a group selling illegal cigarettes. After a long investigation, they found that Sea Patrol Officer Lin had a bad relationship with a large illegal cigarette group. He was also involved in pretending to solve cases and getting reward money unfairly.

The Changhua Prosecutors Office said that Officer Lin knew a couple, the Huangs, ran a big illegal cigarette business. To help their business grow in Taiwan, Officer Lin and the Huangs agreed in 2019 that Lin would give them information about police investigations. This helped protect the group and allowed Lin to act as their helper. The Huang couple gave Officer Lin information about other illegal cigarette makers in Taiwan. Then, Officer Lin used his power as a police officer to stop these other businesses, which were their rivals. This also made it look like Officer Lin was doing a good job finding illegal cigarettes.

**Tsai Ing-wen's Office: Former President Actively Promoted Green Energy, Did Not Interfere in Specific Cases**

The KMT party recently questioned whether a company, Shutung Environmental Technology, which makes floating platforms for offshore solar power, is "friends with the green party" (meaning close to the DPP). They said that support for floating solar power began even before Tsai Ing-wen became president in 2016. Today, Tsai Ing-wen's office stated that she actively worked to develop green energy and encouraged new energy research in industries and universities. However, she did not get involved in the details of any specific projects.

On July 9th, the KMT held a press conference. Taipei City Councilor Chang Szu-kang and KMT spokesperson Yang Chih-yu raised concerns about problems with offshore solar power projects. Yang Chih-yu said that the DPP party started supporting floating solar power when Tsai Ing-wen was in office. Yang Chih-yu showed old news reports saying that before she was elected in 2016, Tsai Ing-wen had a private four-hour talk with Dong Ji-hsu, the chairman of Shutung Environmental Technology. Yang claimed Shutung was very close to the DPP. She said that Tsai Ing-wen supported the company, and former Pingtung County chief Tsao Chi-hung (from the DPP) was an independent director for Shutung. Also, another former county chief, Pan Men-an, not only supported Shutung but also appointed Lu Tai-ying, a former head of Pingtung's Environmental Protection Bureau, who later became an independent director for Shutung after leaving his job.

Tsai Shu-ching, a spokesperson for Tsai Ing-wen's office, spoke about the recent damage to floating structures off the coast of Jiadong, Pingtung, caused by a typhoon. She said that some people are trying to wrongly blame former President Tsai Ing-wen's past policies. She made three points. First, Tsai Shu-ching said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs helped companies develop new energy technologies with government money. This is a common way many countries help industries grow. The Ministry has already shared all the details, so it's easy to check. Second, she added that former President Tsai actively worked to develop green energy and encouraged new energy research by businesses, universities, and research groups. However, she never got involved in the process of any specific project. Third, she said that Yang, a party worker from a certain political party, wrongly claimed in a press conference and news release that Tsai Ing-wen had a "secret talk for four hours" with the company before she was elected. Tsai's office said this claim has no proof and is meant to make Tsai look bad. They called it a "bad habit" for young people in politics, and it is regrettable.

**Chinese Surveillance Cameras Labeled as Made in Taiwan; National Sun Yat-sen University Wins Lawsuit for Compensation**

National Sun Yat-sen University asked for bids to set up a surveillance camera system. A technology company owner, Mr. Hsieh, won the bid. But he bought cheap cameras from China and changed their labels to say they were made by a Taiwanese company. The Changhua District Court sentenced him to 1 year and 4 months in jail for making fake documents. The Kaohsiung District Court also ordered him to pay National Sun Yat-sen University over 240,000 NTD in compensation. He can still appeal this decision.

The Changhua District Court's decision stated that National Sun Yat-sen University asked for bids to set up a surveillance system at its Renwu Campus. Mr. Hsieh's company won the bid for over 240,000 NTD in mid-2021. To follow the contract, which said they could not use products from mainland China, Mr. Hsieh bought surveillance systems made in China from another company that didn't know his plan. Then, he borrowed a label machine to make fake labels that said his own company made the products. This way, he pretended the products were made in Taiwan and successfully got the payment.

During the investigation, it was found that other schools also bought fake "Made in Taiwan" products from Mr. Hsieh. The Changhua District Court sentenced him to 1 year and 4 months in prison for tricking the bidding process twice and for using fake private documents once. He can pay a fine instead of going to jail for the prison sentence. He was also fined 240,000 NTD for breaking government purchasing laws while doing business. However, National Sun Yat-sen University also filed a lawsuit asking for money for the damage. When the Kaohsiung District Court heard the case, Mr. Hsieh did not come to court. So, based on the evidence, the judge ordered him to pay over 240,000 NTD to the university. This case can still be appealed.
