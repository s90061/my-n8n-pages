            <h1>US Finance Minister Says Fed Head Should Not Leave Now</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 22, reported by foreign wires) US Finance Minister Scott Bessent had asked for a full check of the Federal Reserve (Fed) yesterday. But today, he said he sees no reason why the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell, should leave his job right now.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Bessent said this when he talked to Fox Business Network. Mr. Powell is facing more and more pressure from Donald Trump's government to lower interest rates. Trump recently spoke more against Mr. Powell because of the Fed's plan to spend $2.5 billion to make its building new.</p>
            <p>But Trump said he probably would not fire Mr. Powell before his job ends next year. Trump also told reporters today, "I think he is doing very badly, but he will leave soon anyway."</p>
            <p>Bessent also said during the TV talk about Powell, "There is no sign that he should leave right now."</p>
            <p>Bessent said that Powell's time as Fed Chairman will end in May 2026. Powell should finish his full term if he wants to. But Bessent also said that if Powell wants to leave earlier, he should do that too.</p>
            <p>Last night, Bessent wrote on social media, asking the Fed to "do a complete check inside about its actions that are not about money policy." He said the Fed was not doing its main job.</p>
            <p>Bessent wrote on X, a social media site, that the Fed being "independent is key for the US economy to keep growing and stay strong."</p>
            <p>He added, "But this freedom to manage itself is in danger because the Fed's duties are becoming bigger than its main purpose." But he did not say which policy areas he meant.</p>

            <h1>Trump: US and Philippines Agree on Trade, Philippines to Pay 19% Tax</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hou Ziying, Washington, July 22) Today, US President Donald Trump met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. After their meeting, Trump said that the US and the Philippines "finished a trade deal." The Philippines will open its market to American goods and will not charge any taxes on them. The US will charge a 19% tax on goods from the Philippines. This is 1% less than the 20% Trump said he would charge before.</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. is the first leader from Southeast Asia that Trump has met since he became president again. Since Trump started charging equal taxes in early April, the US has made trade deals with other Southeast Asian countries, like Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Trump told reporters during his meeting with Marcos Jr. at the White House that they would talk about trade. He also said, "We are very close to finishing a trade deal," but he did not give more details.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Trump quickly wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social," that the meeting was good. "We finished the trade deal." With this deal, the Philippines will open its market to the US and not charge any taxes. Also, the Philippines will pay 19% in taxes to the US. They will also work together on military things.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that Marcos Jr. is "a very good and strong person to make deals with."</p>
            <p>The Philippines is an important friend to the US in Asia. News from other countries says that last year, the US bought $5 billion more goods from the Philippines than it sold to them. The total trade in goods between the two countries was $23.5 billion.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, Trump sent letters about taxes to more than 20 countries, including Marcos Jr. The letters said that starting August 1, the tax on Philippine goods sent to the US would go up from 17% (said in April) to 20%. The Philippines hopes to get a better trade deal before the August 1 deadline.</p>

            <h1>White House to Share New AI Plan, Wants to Send US Technology Abroad to Grow</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 22, reported by foreign wires) A paper seen by Reuters shows that the US White House plans to share a new idea tomorrow. It will ask to send US artificial intelligence (AI) technology to other countries. It will also work against state laws that seem too strict and stop AI from growing well.</p>
            <p>According to a short version of the plan seen by Reuters, the White House will not give federal money for AI to states that have very strict rules for AI. It will also ask the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to check if state rules are different from federal rules.</p>
            <p>This plan will also help develop AI that is "open source" and "open weight." This means people can use and change the AI code freely. It will also "send US AI technology to other countries using full-stack solutions" and a program by the Commerce Department for data centers.</p>
            <p>The paper says this plan will "focus on making jobs and big changes in industries through AI, making American workers more skilled."</p>
            <p>Janet Egan, a researcher at "The Center for a New American Security" in the US, said that, as Reuters explained, this plan means a change in how the market is approached. It moves from President Joe Biden's earlier plans that "limited AI" to focusing on "how to start spreading the basic systems and technology that the world uses."</p>
            <p>The short version of the plan says that even though it focuses on growing AI, it does talk about how important it is to "stop bad use and be ready for future risks related to AI."</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump in January told his government to make a plan to "make America the main place for artificial intelligence in the world." He also asked them to make fewer rules that stop AI from growing quickly.</p>
            <p>This report, which includes ideas from the National Security Council (NSC), will be put out tomorrow. Trump is set to give an important speech tomorrow at an event called "Winning the AI Race." This event is put together by White House AI and crypto expert David Sacks and co-hosts of the "All-In" podcast.</p>
