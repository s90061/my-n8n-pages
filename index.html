            <h1>Government Says Rescue Workers Are Not Stopped from Going to Guangfu</h1>
            <p>Reports on the internet said that rescue workers were told to stop going to Guangfu, a place affected by floods in Hualien. However, the Executive Yuan (Taiwan's government) says this is not true.</p>
            <p>A dammed lake on the Matai'an River caused a big flood, and Guangfu Township was hit hard. More than 1,500 homes were damaged. Many people from different places came to help clean up after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Ji Lian-cheng, who works for the Central Disaster Emergency Response Center, said today that the government did not tell volunteers to stop going to Guangfu. He also said they are still helping volunteers at Guangfu Station. They help volunteers sign in, find places to work, and get transportation. For October 2nd, they think they will need 560 volunteers. He thanked all the volunteers for their hard work and for helping with the recovery efforts.</p>
            <p>Ji Lian-cheng explained that Guangfu has 7 villages, and these are divided into 7 areas. For each area, a military officer (Lieutenant Colonel or higher) works with the county government and the village head. They organize the rescue teams, volunteers, and equipment. They solve problems and meet needs quickly. The Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Ministry of Transportation are still at the volunteer station in Guangfu Station. They help volunteers with transport, places to stay, and assigning tasks. This helps volunteers from all over Taiwan with their lodging and travel needs.</p>

            <h1>Former Bank Employee Stole Customer Money, Bank Fined NT$2 Million</h1>
            <p>Today, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced that it has fined Cooperative Bank NT$2 million (about US$60,000). This is because a former teller at the bank took money that belonged to customers and money collected for taxes. The bank did not follow its own internal rules correctly.</p>
            <p>The FSC said on its website today that the former teller stole money that customers paid for taxes and fees. The teller did not put these payments into the bank's system right away. Also, the accounting staff did not check all the payment slips carefully. They also did not check the cash in the vault as they should have. In addition, the former teller used extra withdrawal slips to take out cash when helping customers. These mistakes show that the bank did not follow its internal rules well.</p>
            <p>The FSC stated that Cooperative Bank was fined NT$2 million based on Article 129, Paragraph 7 of the Banking Act.</p>

            <h1>Lee Da-hye Helps with Flood Relief and Says She Got Courage from Those Affected</h1>
            <p>After the Matai'an River in Hualien flooded, Guangfu Township was badly damaged. Lee Da-hye, a Korean cheerleader for the Wei Chuan Dragons baseball team, said on social media on September 26 that she donated NT$300,000 through a disaster relief fund. Today, people shared that Lee Da-hye quietly went to Guangfu Township to help clean up the mud. She worked like a "shovel superhero," and many people on the internet thanked her for her help.</p>
            <p>In the evening, Lee Da-hye also shared her thoughts about helping with the disaster. She said it was her first time using a shovel, and she was not very good at it. She felt eager to help, but her body could not always keep up with her desire to help.</p>
            <p>Lee Da-hye said that a mother whose home was affected taught her something important. This mother did not look sad. Instead, she welcomed the helpers kindly. Lee Da-hye learned a lot from her positive attitude even in a difficult situation. She added that she thought she was there to help others, but she actually got courage from the volunteers and the people who were affected. She also expressed her deepest respect and thanks to everyone who is still working hard in their roles. This is not the first time Lee Da-hye has helped others. Last year, after the Hualien earthquake on April 3rd, she donated NT$300,000 for relief efforts. In January of this year, she also gave NT$500,000 from her YouTube channel earnings to a children's welfare group.</p>
