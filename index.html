            <h1>Teachers and students from Hungkuang University go to remote areas in summer to help old and young people learn together and pass on culture</h1>
            <p>Hungkuang University's Department of Senior Citizen Welfare and Long-Term Care is working to help with education for older people and social services. This summer, 22 teachers and students went to remote areas. They planned many different classes for local elementary school students and older people. Their goal is to help different generations learn together and keep local culture alive.</p>
            <p>Hungkuang University released a press statement today. The Department of Senior Citizen Welfare and Long-Term Care held a 5-day summer camp called "Generational Integration Ã— Local Culture" at Zhongshan Elementary School in Dongshi District, Taichung City. The camp included activities like experiencing old age, making crafts, learning about local culture, drawing pictures of grandparents and grandchildren, and learning about children's nutrition.</p>
            <p>The camp used local culture to teach children about Hakka culture stories. It also had activities where children could experience what it is like to be old. This helped them understand the difficulties and problems older people face in their daily lives.</p>
            <p>Assistant Professor Hsu Meng-jue from the Senior Citizen Welfare Department said that he hopes students can learn from real-life situations in the community, not just from books. This way, they can see the truth about Taiwan's aging society and education in remote areas. More importantly, he wants to build a "three-way" model of working together with the local community, sharing, and creating good things.</p>
            <p>On the first day of the summer camp, university students helped children "get to know older people." Children used colorful clay to make models of their grandparents and shared stories about them. For the old age experience activities, children wore special equipment that made them feel what it's like to be old. They played games to understand how aging can cause problems like difficulty moving, poor eyesight, or trouble picking things up. This helped them truly experience the daily lives of older people.</p>
            <p>The camp also invited a local Hakka culture teacher to share "The Story of Bogong" (a local earth god). Children also made and played with Hakka bamboo toys. This helped them learn about local stories and Hakka culture.</p>
            <p>The university student volunteers for the camp were new students and students from their second to fourth years in the Senior Citizen Welfare Department. They shared that they had training and practiced activities beforehand. They also used their knowledge of senior citizen welfare and long-term care to lead activities for children and older people. By volunteering in the community, they learned how to lead activities. More importantly, they learned to respect, listen, and connect with the unique aspects of each community.</p>

            <h1>Singapore makes laws stronger against e-cigarettes and will treat etomidate as a drug</h1>
            <p>The problem of e-cigarettes in Singapore is getting a lot of attention. The Singapore government will treat e-cigarettes, especially those mixed with "etomidate," as a drug problem. They will increase efforts in law enforcement and education.</p>
            <p>Singapore has banned e-cigarettes since 2018. However, recently, "Zombie Pods" (Kpods) that contain etomidate have become a public concern.</p>
            <p>According to Lianhe Zaobao, Singapore's Health Minister Ong Ye Kung spoke at an event and said that etomidate will be added to the "Misuse of Drugs Act" as a Class C controlled drug.</p>
            <p>There is growing concern about etomidate and other addictive and harmful substances being mixed into e-cigarettes and sold. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong recently said at the National Day Rally that the government will treat e-cigarettes like a drug problem. They will improve law enforcement and education to fight this issue more strongly.</p>
            <p>Wong said that for people addicted to e-cigarettes, the authorities will help them quit through supervision and recovery programs. They will also start a big public education campaign. This campaign will begin in schools and higher education places, and also include national service.</p>
            <p>The report states that e-cigarettes containing etomidate are sometimes called "Zombie Pods." They can harm users' health and may cause serious side effects. These can include feeling sick and throwing up, uncontrolled muscle twitching, or being confused. It could even lead to organ failure or death.</p>
            <p>Now that etomidate is a Class C drug, users must get mandatory supervision and treatment. Repeat offenders will be taken to court and could go to jail for at least one year. People who sell, distribute, or import these e-cigarettes will face even stricter punishments, including possibly caning.</p>
            <p>Users will get a health check at the National Addictions Management Centre. Depending on how severe their addiction is, patients might be sent to outpatient programs for one-on-one or group counseling.</p>
            <p>The report also states that to stop e-cigarettes from entering Singapore, checks were increased at sea, land, and air checkpoints last week. In five days, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority found 184 cases involving e-cigarettes. They seized over 850 e-cigarettes and related items.</p>
