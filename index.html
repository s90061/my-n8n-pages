<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s overseas branch plans to issue $10 billion in new shares. This is their largest effort yet to manage the changing value of the local currency.

TSMC Global Ltd. will issue these shares to help protect against currency fluctuations, the company announced. This is the third such deal since 2024, and by far the biggest. These actions have happened when the Taiwan dollar was getting stronger. The moves give TSMC Global, which handles overseas investments and currency hedging, more financial flexibility to deal with exchange rate risks.

Recent increases in the Taiwan dollar have caused concern in Taipei because the economy relies heavily on exports. In May, the currency made its largest one-day gain since the 1980s, leading the central bank to ask for measures to control speculation.

"Generally speaking, increased currency volatility would mean that banks might be changing their margin requirements," said Philip McNicholas, an Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco in Singapore. "Issuing new shares and bringing in an immediate cash injection could help companies meet the margin requirements for both existing and new hedges."

TSMC, a major chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is Taiwan's largest company and exporter, as most of its production is local. A stronger Taiwan dollar harms exporters because the US dollars they earn from sales abroad would be worth less in local currency, or they would need to raise prices overseas, which could reduce demand.

In June, CEO C. C. Wei informed shareholders that the company's operating profit margin had dropped by several percentage points due to the stronger local currency.

**US House unanimously passes "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act", wants Trump to support Taiwan joining IMF! Ministry of Foreign Affairs responds**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%87-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

The US House of Representatives on June 23rd orally and unanimously approved the "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," a bill proposed by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. This act directs the United States to use its influence and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's participation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including its involvement in economic oversight, technical assistance, and the eligibility of Taiwanese individuals to work at the IMF. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) stated today (June 24th) that this act is positive for supporting Taiwan's broader international involvement and counteracting China's pressure on Taiwan, and that it will closely monitor the bill's future progress.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," which requests the US administration to help Taiwan join the IMF, was proposed and passed by the US House Financial Services Committee in March this year and received unanimous verbal approval from the full House on the 23rd. The bill was jointly introduced by Republican lawmaker Young Kim and Democratic lawmaker Al Green.

Young Kim stated that China continues to block Taiwan's participation in international organizations like the IMF because it understands that financial security is as crucial as military security. China could harm Taiwan's financial system by raising tariffs, selling off stocks, and freezing bank transfers. Joining the IMF would provide Taiwan with resources that help strengthen its financial stability and resist China's economic pressure.

In response, MOFA spokesperson Hsiao Kuang-wei said at a regular press conference this morning that the act has a positive meaning for supporting Taiwan's increased international participation and countering China's pressure. MOFA thanked the US House of Representatives for unanimously passing the act, which not only fully demonstrates the strong bipartisan support from the US Congress for Taiwan's participation in international organizations and expansion of its global presence, but also further highlights the importance of strengthening Taiwan's economic resilience and global partnerships.

MOFA stated that it will closely follow the bill's development and will maintain close coordination and communication with contacts in the US Congress and the administration to continue building positive momentum for Taiwan's international participation.

Regarding this non-discrimination act concerning Taiwan, after its passage by the US House of Representatives on the 23rd, it must be passed by the US Senate in an identical version and then sent to the White House for the President's signature to officially become law. The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee has already passed a similar bill in early June, and it is now awaiting a full Senate vote.

**Taiwan's new AI supercomputer Nano5, Compal, ASE and other Taiwanese manufacturers adopt its computing power**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%96%B0ai%E8%B6%85%E7%B4%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%85%A6nano5-%E4%BB%81%E5%AF%B6%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%88%E5%85%89%E7%AD%89%E5%8F%B0%E5%BB%A0%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E7%AE%97%E5%8A%9B-073107510.html">News Link</a>

(Central News Agency, Taipei, June 24) The National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) held a press conference today to demonstrate how its new national AI supercomputer, Nano 5, is driving innovation and improvements in the semiconductor industry. Companies and academic institutions such as Compal Electronics, ASE Technology Holding, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, and National Cheng Kung University also attended and shared their experiences.

It is understood that Nano 5, Taiwan's new generation AI supercomputer, is scheduled to launch on June 25th. It features NVIDIA H100 GPUs, providing strong AI computing capabilities to various industries.

The NCHC stated that Nano 5 will combine Taiwan's strengths in semiconductors to create a complete AI ecosystem, forming an "AI Team Taiwan."

Nano 5 has a computing power of 4.15 Petaflops. Companies like Synopsys have already benefited from using Nano 5 to make their semiconductor design processes better. Additionally, 15 AI startups are also using Nano 5 to speed up their AI model development and implementation. The NCHC aims to provide full support for Taiwan's AI development, from advanced research to industrial applications.`;
