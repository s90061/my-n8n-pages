Google DeepMind has recently introduced AlphaFold 3, a powerful new artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI can predict the structures of many important biological molecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, with high accuracy. Understanding these shapes is very important for biology and especially for developing new medicines.

Before AlphaFold 3, scientists often spent years trying to figure out these complex 3D structures. This process was expensive and slow. Now, AlphaFold 3 can do it much faster, offering a big step forward. This means researchers could find new drugs and treatments faster and more easily for various diseases, from cancer to genetic problems.

The technology could also help us understand diseases better and improve agriculture by designing new enzymes. While the potential benefits are huge, there is also talk about using this powerful tool carefully, especially regarding its potential for misuse. However, the scientific community is mostly excited about its promise to speed up discoveries and make people healthier.

**The Four-Day Work Week: A Growing Global Trend**

The idea of working just four days a week instead of five, often for the same pay, is becoming a popular idea around the world. More companies and governments are starting to test this model, seeing it as a way to make employees happier and more productive.

Supporters of the four-day week point to many good points. Employees often report feeling less stressed, more rested, and generally happier. This can lead to a better balance between work and life, giving people more time for hobbies, family, or personal development. Some studies from trials in countries like the UK, Iceland, and the US have shown that employees are not only happier but also more focused and productive during their shorter work week, with some companies even seeing an increase in profits.

However, moving to a four-day week isn't easy for every business. Industries that require constant service, like healthcare, education, or retail, face bigger challenges in adopting this model without affecting customer service or staff levels. Businesses also need to carefully plan how to fit a full week's work into fewer days. Despite these challenges, many successful trial programs suggest that the four-day work week could become a more common way to work in the future.

**Earth Reaches New Temperature Records, Climate Change Impacts Grow**

The Earth has recently had its hottest year ever recorded, a clear sign of climate change getting worse. Many scientists and groups have confirmed that global average temperatures are continuing to rise, leading to more often and stronger extreme weather events across the globe.

This rise in temperature is causing many serious problems. We are seeing more severe heatwaves, which can be dangerous for people's health and farming. Droughts are becoming longer and more widespread, affecting water supplies and meaning less food can be grown. At the same time, some regions are experiencing heavier rainfall, causing very damaging floods and earth slides. Wildfires, often worsened by hotter, drier weather, are also becoming more common and harder to control.

These changes are impacting daily life for millions, from damage to homes and infrastructure to problems with growing food and increased health risks. Experts say that these events will continue to worsen unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced a lot. Governments and international bodies are asking for faster action on climate plans and green energy solutions to protect the planet and the people living on it.
