Taiwan's Public Service Pension Fund lost NT$45.3 billion (about US$1.4 billion) by the end of May this year. This means the fund's return rate was negative 4.52%.

The fund's own investments in fixed income lost money, and its capital gains also saw losses. Money managed by other companies also lost about 4.81%. The fund has about 53% of its money invested in Taiwan and 46% in other countries.

By May, Taiwan's stock market was down 7.33%, but global stock markets and bond markets saw some growth. The government will continue to watch the fund's performance.
