            <h1>13 National Forest Recreation Areas Offer Half-Price Tickets for Double Ten Day Holiday</h1>
            <p>The Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture announced today that 13 national forest recreation areas under its control will offer half-price entrance tickets during the Double Ten Day holiday from October 10th to 12th. People can enjoy the diverse look of the national forests, which will slowly change to autumn colors among the green trees.</p>
            <p>The 13 national forest recreation areas managed by the agency include Taipingshan, Neidong, Manyueyuan, Dongyanshan, Lala Mountain, Dasyueshan, Baxianshan, Aowanda, Alishan, Kenting, Shuangliu, Zhiben, and Chihnan.</p>
            <p>The Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency stated that in early autumn, different national forest parks show many beautiful views. The beech trees along the Taipingshan trail are slowly turning golden, creating a shiny golden path. The green maples in Manyueyuan are changing to red autumn clothes. In Dongyanshan, Lala Mountain, Baxianshan, and Alishan, red maple leaves add a strong autumn feeling to the trails. The wonderful bald cypress trees in Aowanda are also turning red, matching the maple leaves in the forest. In Dasyueshan, you can often see beautiful sea of clouds and sunsets in the evening. The autumn colors slowly appearing among the green mountains make the forest recreation areas show rich and varied forest landscapes.</p>
            <p>For national forest recreation areas in lower elevations, like Neidong, Shuangliu, Kenting, Zhiben, and Chihnan, the weather becomes cool and pleasant in autumn. Neidong and Shuangliu have waterfalls full of negative ions. Kenting has the silent silver leaf fig trees that protect the forest. Zhiben has the huge Banyan trees with many roots. Chihnan keeps important logging culture from the Halun area. These are all great places for a slow forest trip in autumn.</p>

            <h1>Miaoli Man Commits Random Stabbing Again After Leaving Prison; Village Chief Says He is Like a Time Bomb</h1>
            <p>A 48-year-old man named Chiu in Miaoli City used a knife to hurt two primary school children and one man yesterday. Mr. Chiu had committed a random stabbing in the same way 10 years ago. Now, he has done it again. The local village chief sadly said Mr. Chiu is like a time bomb and asked, "How can a person like this be changed for the better?"</p>
            <p>Chou Wen-cheng, the village chief of Shangmiao Village in Miaoli City, told CNA today that the event happened in front of the convenience store across from his office. Yesterday afternoon, when school ended, a teacher from the after-school care center next door rushed over with the injured girl, Ding, asking for help. She was also scared and shouted, "Someone is killing people! He (Mr. Chiu) has hurt many people."</p>
            <p>Chou Wen-cheng said that the girl's chest was bleeding a lot at that time. He and others quickly called 119 and the police. They used two towels to help stop the bleeding. The girl felt weak and almost passed out, so it was a very serious situation.</p>
            <p>Chou Wen-cheng said that a nearby neighborhood leader saw the attacker randomly hurting people with a knife and then riding away on a motorcycle. The leader tried to chase him but could not catch him. Later, he gave the license plate number to the police. The police quickly found out that the attacker was Mr. Chiu, who had committed a random stabbing at the same convenience store 10 years ago. Many police officers then went to Mr. Chiu's home and caught him.</p>
            <p>In 2015, Mr. Chiu was thought to be confused after taking drugs. He rushed into a convenience store with sharp scissors and randomly stabbed people who were shopping. Four people, including a police officer, were hurt.</p>
            <p>Chou Wen-cheng said that Mr. Chiu was sentenced to more than 8 years in prison. He was released in March this year and recently came back to Miaoli City. People in the area felt calm for a few months, but then he did it again yesterday. This made everyone feel scared and worried. People really don't know how such a person can be "changed for the better."</p>

            <h1>Advantech Works with Qualcomm's Edge Impulse to Make Edge AI Development Faster</h1>
            <p>Companies are changing digitally, and artificial intelligence (AI) and reaching net-zero carbon emissions are two big challenges for governments and businesses. These are important for Taiwan's future success. CNA's reporting team went deep to show how the government and different industries are using AI to make production better and create green ideas. This shows Taiwan's industry moving forward again.</p>
            <p>Advantech, a big industrial computer company, announced today that it will start a special partnership with Edge Impulse. Edge Impulse is a software company from Silicon Valley, owned by Qualcomm. It provides a platform for developing AI on edge devices. This partnership will help make edge AI development faster.</p>
            <p>Advantech said in a press release that with this partnership, Advantech will put Edge Impulse's easy-to-use AI development tools into Advantech's edge computing platforms. This will make it much easier to develop AI. It will help companies quickly create, use, and grow smart projects on edge devices, making products ready for the market faster.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller Chang, General Manager of Advantech's Embedded IoT Group, said that by putting Edge Impulse into Advantech's edge computing platforms, customers will be able to make their model development much simpler. They can move smoothly from trying out ideas to actually using them. He hopes this partnership will lead to new ideas in many areas, such as manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and smart cities.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zach Shelby, Vice President of Product Management at Qualcomm Finland RFFE Oy, said that as edge AI technology gets better, developers need advanced tools that can help them use and expand their products for mass production. This partnership will work together to make AI development clearer and simpler to use.</p>
