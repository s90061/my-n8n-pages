            <h1>Kremlin Says Putin and Trump Talked for 2.5 Hours; Preparations for Summit to Start Soon</h1>
            <p>Moscow, October 16 (CNA) â€“ The Kremlin, Russia's government office, said today that President Putin and US President Trump had a very open and trusting phone call that lasted two and a half hours. After this call, the Kremlin will "immediately" start getting ready for a meeting between the two leaders.</p>
            <p>Yuri Ushakov, a top helper for Putin, told reporters that both sides agreed that their representatives would start preparing for the meeting right away. He said a possible place for the meeting could be Budapest, the capital of Hungary.</p>
            <p>Ushakov also mentioned that Trump suggested Budapest as the meeting place, and Putin agreed "immediately."</p>
            <p>He added that the phone call was very important and also "extremely open and full of trust." He also said that Russia started the two-and-a-half-hour call.</p>
            <p>Putin and Trump met in Alaska, USA, on August 15, but they did not make any real progress. In the last two months, efforts to reach a peace agreement in Ukraine have slowed down.</p>
            <p>The call between Putin and Trump today happened while Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was traveling to Washington D.C. He was going to talk with Trump about things like the US possibly giving Tomahawk long-range missiles. Later, sources told AFP that Zelenskyy had arrived in Washington D.C.</p>
            <p>Ushakov said that Putin repeated that Tomahawk missiles would not change the situation on the battlefield. However, he warned that they would seriously harm the relationship between the two countries and make a peaceful solution to the Russia-Ukraine war less likely.</p>
            <p>Andriy Sybiga, Ukraine's foreign minister, wrote on social media platform X: "President Trump and Putin's call today shows that even just talking about Tomahawk missiles has made Putin talk with the US again."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ushakov also said that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will talk in the next few days. This is to get ready for the new meeting between Trump and Putin. The exact time of the meeting will depend on how fast the preparations go.</p>
            <p>According to the Kremlin, Trump promised to think about Putin's ideas from the call before meeting with Zelenskyy tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Russian forces carried out another big air attack last night, causing power outages across Ukraine. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said in a statement that "Russia has again chosen missiles instead of talking." She added that this attack directly went against Trump's efforts for peace. She said that "these attacks show that Moscow's plan is to scare and wear down" and that "the only way to respond effectively is to put pressure â€“ through stronger punishments, better air defense systems, and providing long-range military power."
