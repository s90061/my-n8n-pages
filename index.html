            <h1>Air Canada Flight Attendants' Strike Stops Flights; Government Steps In</h1>
            <p>The Canadian government took action today to stop the strike by Air Canada flight attendants. This strike caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled and made summer travel difficult for about 130,000 passengers that Air Canada serves daily.</p>
            <p>Air Canada is the biggest airline in Canada, flying directly to 180 cities around the world. About 10,000 of its flight attendants began a strike today at midnight because of a disagreement about pay.</p>
            <p>A few hours later, Canada's Minister of Labour, Patty Hajdu, used legal powers to end the strike. She forced both the workers and the company to go through a process called binding arbitration. In this process, a third party will make a decision that both sides must follow.</p>
            <p>However, she said that Air Canada might still need 5 to 10 days to get back to normal flight schedules.</p>
            <p>The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which represents the flight attendants, said its members will continue to strike until the government officially gives them a document telling them to go back to work.</p>
            <p>The Air Canada part of the union posted on Facebook, asking everyone to remember that the strike is "only now going to arbitration. We still have the legal right to strike, and we will keep doing it. We need to show the company that we are in control."</p>
            <p>A big problem in the talks was pay for time spent on the ground. But both sides also disagreed on overall wages. Air Canada offered a 38% pay raise over 4 years, with a 25% raise in the first year. However, the union felt this was not enough.</p>
            <p>The union said that Air Canada offered to pay flight attendants for some past unpaid work. But the amount they offered was only half of their normal hourly pay.</p>
            <p>A person close to the talks said that the union wants pay to be equal to Air Transat. Flight attendants at Air Transat agreed to a new contract last year. They got a 30% pay raise over 5 years, making them the highest-paid flight attendants in Canada's airline industry now.</p>
            <p>Air Canada did not confirm if the union asked for such a pay raise.</p>

            <h1>U.S. State Department Announces Stop to Issuing Visas for Gaza Residents</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Department of State announced today that it will stop giving U.S. visas to all people from the Gaza Strip. This will happen while the government checks things very carefully. Groups that support Palestine have said this action is wrong.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Department of State said that it has only given out a "few" temporary medical visas recently. But it did not give an exact number.</p>
            <p>Data from the U.S. Department of State website shows that this year, the U.S. has given more than 3,800 B1/B2 visas to people who have travel documents from the Palestinian Authority. These visas allow people from other countries to come to the U.S. for medical treatment.</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Authority gives these travel documents to people living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which are areas Israel controls. The U.S. Department of State website does not show detailed numbers for these two areas.</p>
            <p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations said this action is bad. They said it is the latest sign of "planned cruelty" from the government of U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>The Palestine Childrenâ€™s Relief Fund said that stopping these visas will mean that children from the Gaza Strip who are hurt or sick will not be able to get medical care.</p>
            <p>The U.S. government made this decision after a very conservative online personality, Laura Loomer, who influences Trump, complained on social media. She was upset that injured Palestinians were allowed to get medical treatment in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Laura Loomer posted many messages on X (formerly Twitter). She asked the State Department to stop giving visas to Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. She said they "support Hamas" and "are connected to the Muslim Brotherhood and funded by Qatar," but she did not show any proof.</p>

            <h1>Hurricane Erin Becomes Category 5 and Nears Caribbean Sea; May Cause Floods and Landslides</h1>
            <p>Hurricane Erin is moving towards the Caribbean Sea. Today, it became a very strong Category 5 hurricane. Weather experts have warned that it might cause big floods, landslides, and mudslides.</p>
            <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its latest report that at 11:20 AM (3:20 PM GMT), Erin's strongest winds became 255 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Erin is the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean. It is now about 170 kilometers northeast of Anguilla, which is in the northern part of the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean Sea. This area includes the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.</p>
            <p>The middle of the hurricane is expected to pass north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend.</p>
            <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane Erin could bring up to 150 millimeters of rain to these islands.</p>
            <p>The National Hurricane Center also warned that some areas might have very large floods, including floods in cities. This could also cause landslides or mudslides.</p>
            <p>Very large waves from the hurricane will affect parts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands this weekend.</p>
            <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that these big waves will reach the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States early next week. They might cause "very dangerous large waves and strong currents in the water."</p>
