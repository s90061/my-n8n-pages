On July 13th, during Taiwan's "Han Kuang 41" military exercise, a CM11 tank hit a private car in Taoyuan City. The accident happened when the tank, starting from under Highway 61, went over the road's dividing line and hit the front left side of a car waiting for traffic. Luckily, no one was hurt in the incident.

The Sixth Army Corps, which the tank belongs to, said they are working with the police to find out exactly what happened. They also stated that the incident will be handled according to the rules of military vehicle insurance. This accident follows another incident on July 10th, where a tank hit a house and a car in Xinwu District because the driver did not know the roads well. The military says they will continue to improve safety training to prevent such accidents.

**Mayor Lu Calls for End to Recalls, Focus on Disaster Relief**

On July 13th, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen asked the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to stop their efforts to recall politicians and instead send their party workers to help in disaster areas. Speaking at a rally for Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Wang Hung-wei in Taipei, Mayor Lu said that the DPP has about 1,000 party workers who should go to places like Chiayi, Tainan, Pingtung, and Kaohsiung to help with flood relief.

She stated that it is wrong to focus on political recalls, calling it a "political disaster" at a time when real disasters need attention. Other important KMT figures, like Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an, also spoke at the event. Chiang asked people to support Wang Hung-wei, saying she is in a difficult situation. New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih encouraged people to vote "no" on recall ballots on July 26th and to ask their friends to vote too. KMT Chairman Eric Chu also urged people to vote against the DPP, President Lai Ching-te, and the DPP's leader in the legislature.

**Nomura Warns of Big Drop in China's Economic Demand**

Nomura Securities, a financial company, warned in a report on July 9th that China's economy will face a major change in the middle of this year. They expect that the demand for goods and services in China will "fall sharply" in the second half of 2025. Nomura predicts that China's yearly economic growth will go down from 5.1% in the first six months to 4% in the last six months of the year.

The report lists several reasons for this expected drop. Companies exported a lot early in the year to avoid new taxes, which means fewer exports later. Also, China's housing market has been getting smaller for five years, with falling sales and prices, which hurts how much people buy inside the country. Other issues include less effective government policies to encourage spending, falling prices for goods made by factories, and new government rules that reduce spending on things like expensive food and drinks.

Nomura also said that the government's efforts to fix problems with too much production will slow down demand for raw materials and reduce investment. The company suggests that China needs to make big changes, like dealing with housing debt and making people feel safer about their money, to help the economy. Nomura is cautious about China's economy for the rest of 2025, believing it could slow down a lot if new strong policies are not put in place, but they also believe the Chinese economy is still strong in some ways.
