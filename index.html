            <h1>Apple Updates iOS 26 and Other Software, Adds AI Live Translation and Visual Intelligence</h1>
            <p>Today, Apple updated its software platforms like iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. They now use a new design called Liquid Glass. New features from the personal smart system, Apple Intelligence, are also added. These include live translation, smart vision for screen content, and smart actions in "Shortcuts."</p>
            <p>Apple explained on its official website that the new Liquid Glass design is now on all its software platforms for the first time. It keeps each platform's special parts but makes them feel more similar. Liquid Glass is a new see-through material. It reflects and bends light from around it. It also changes to show content more clearly.</p>
            <p>Apple Intelligence helps users talk easily across different languages. It does this with live translation in Messages, FaceTime, Phone, and AirPods. The "Visual Intelligence" update lets users take a screenshot of what they see on their screen. Then they can ask questions about it to the ChatGPT chatbot. They can also use Google and other apps to find similar pictures.</p>
            <p>Apple Intelligence has more new features. Users can now combine emojis to make new "Genmoji" emojis. They can also use ChatGPT in "Image Playground" to find new image styles. Apple Intelligence also powers the "Workout Buddy" feature. This gives personal voice encouragement during workouts.</p>
            <p>iOS 26 brings more ways to customize the "Lock Screen." This includes adaptive time display and 3D space scenes. It also improves apps like Camera, Photos, Safari, and Phone. "Call Screening" can filter calls from unknown numbers. "Hold Assist" can hold your place in line when you wait for a real person to answer a customer service call.</p>
            <p>iOS 26 also adds "Lyric Translation and Pronunciation" to Apple Music. It adds "Visited Places" to Apple Maps. It also offers order tracking in Apple Wallet. Updates to AirPods let creators record with great sound quality. They can also control the Camera app remotely.</p>
            <p>The new menu bar in iPadOS 26 lets users open in-app commands. They can do this by swiping down from the top of the screen or moving the cursor to the top. The "Files" app offers new ways to manage files and make your own folders. Also, folders can now be placed on the Dock. This lets users get to downloaded files or documents easily, anywhere, anytime.</p>
            <p>macOS Tahoe makes Mac computers much better for work. It offers more ways to personalize your Mac. This includes an updated "Control Center" and new colors for folders, app icons, and widgets. The menu bar is fully clear, making the screen look wider. Spotlight has a big update. It now has new ways to look at files and apps and better search. "Shortcuts" can use Apple Intelligence to do many complex tasks automatically.</p>
            <p>watchOS 26 offers more ways to personalize. A new "Sleep Score" feature is on Apple Watch. It helps users understand their sleep quality better. The new system has "Smart Stack" alerts. These give useful tips right away. "Live Translation" in Messages can automatically translate text into the user's chosen language. A new one-hand wrist flip gesture can skip notifications, silence calls, stop alarms, and go back to the watch face.</p>
            <p>tvOS 26 has an "Apple Music Sing" karaoke feature. It can turn an iPhone into a wireless microphone for Apple TV. Friends can also use their iPhones to choose songs. FaceTime's "Contact Posters" make it easier for users to start calls in their living room.</p>
            <p>visionOS 26 offers small tools that fit perfectly into the user's surroundings. They appear automatically every time you wear the Apple Vision Pro spatial computer. The spatial browsing feature changes how articles look in the Safari browser. Developers can now put 3D objects directly into web pages. visionOS 26 also adds support for playing 180-degree, 360-degree, and wide-view sports camera content. This includes certain Insta360, GoPro, and Canon models.</p>

            <h1>Investment Firm: US Stocks Rise, Meta Conference Watched, Taiwan Stocks Focus on AI</h1>
            <p>People expect the U.S. central bank to lower interest rates. Because of this, major U.S. stock indexes all closed higher on September 15. Nvidia's stock price went down by 0.04%. TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) went up by 0.79%. An investment firm said that Meta, Facebook's parent company, will have its developer conference on September 17. The conference will likely focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the metaverse. What happens with these industries will be important for the market. Also, everyone is watching what the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will do about lowering interest rates.</p>
            <p>Today, four listed stocksâ€”TSMC, KMC, Evergreen Health, and Ritekâ€”will pay out dividends. This will make Taiwan's stock index drop by 40.48 points at the start of trading. TSMC will pay NT$5 per share. This means its total market value will go down by about NT$129.7 billion. This drop accounts for about 40.43 points of the weighted stock index.</p>
            <p>Looking at the U.S. stock market on September 15, investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower interest rates later this week. The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq index both reached new record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a small 49.23 points, or 0.11%, ending at 45883.45 points. The S&P 500 index went up by 30.99 points, or 0.47%, closing at 6615.28 points. The Nasdaq index jumped by 207.65 points, or 0.94%, to 22348.75 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index increased by 58.09 points, or 0.97%, to close at 6059.83 points.</p>
            <p>For Taiwan stocks, the index fell by 117.48 points on September 15, closing at 25357.16 points. The total value of shares traded was NT$397.448 billion. The three main types of institutional investors sold a total of NT$4.206 billion more than they bought. Among them, proprietary traders bought NT$996 million more than they sold. Investment trusts sold NT$7.748 billion more than they bought. Foreign investors and Chinese investors bought NT$2.546 billion more than they sold.</p>
            <p>KGI Investment Advisory said that if we look at the technical aspects, Taiwan stocks fell on September 15, and fewer shares were traded. The market showed big ups and downs at a high level. But the average lines still show a bullish trend. The trading volume was lower than the 5-day average for two days in a row. It was even lower than the 20-day average. We need to see if the market can stay above the 5-day moving average in the short term.</p>

            <h1>German "Rust Belt" Voters More Worried, Expert Says: Could Become Stronghold for AfD Party</h1>
            <p>The election results in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia state are mostly final. The ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) got the most support. They stopped the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has grown in recent years. But experts say the AfD got three times more votes in the Ruhr industrial area, Germany's "Rust Belt." This shows that voters are more and more worried about immigration and a bad economy. The "Rust Belt" might become a strong support area for the AfD in the future.</p>
            <p>North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populated state, held local elections on September 14. In 53 cities and districts, the ruling party, CDU, led in more than 30 areas. The Green Party lost many votes. But they still did well in young university cities and big cities like MÃ¼nster, Cologne, and Bonn.</p>
            <p>Norbert Kersting, a political science professor at MÃ¼nster University, said today in an online meeting with reporters that this election is very important for Berlin. It is the biggest local election after the German federal government has been in power for 100 days.</p>
            <p>Before the election, people wondered if the AfD would get more power locally. The results show that older parties like the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) lost some votes. But they still stopped the AfD from gaining more control.</p>
            <p>Kersting said that the AfD could not put forward candidates in many cities. They did not have enough people to work at the local level. Also, their policies only talked about immigration for a long time. They did not talk about local issues like transport and housing. This is why the AfD did not do as well in North Rhine-Westphalia as they did in national elections.</p>
            <p>However, in Ruhr area cities like Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen, and Hagen, the AfD's votes went up a lot. Experts think this is an important sign.</p>
            <p>The Ruhr industrial area used to be the heart of Germany. It grew because of coal and steel. Working-class people traditionally supported the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which is center-left. As German industries changed, many factories closed. This caused some small towns in the Ruhr area to lose jobs and people.</p>
            <p>In the local elections on September 15, the AfD got almost 30% of the votes in Gelsenkirchen. This is more than three times what they got before. Their support is now close to the SPD, which has traditionally been the biggest party there.</p>
            <p>Ansgar Hudde, a sociologist from Cologne University, said that the SPD keeps losing support from traditional working-class voters. Many loyal voters would rather not vote than vote for the SPD again.</p>
            <p>Kersting believes that the AfD attracts more than just working-class people in the Ruhr area. They also attract "fearful citizens" who become extreme because they are afraid. These people are very worried about changes in society, immigration, and a bad economy. This worry turns into strong political anger.</p>
            <p>The AfD does not have much experience running local governments. But they can grow slowly in the "Rust Belt" by making people's worries bigger. This challenges the older parties. Kersting expects this support to grow even more. This is because local governments have less money and the economy is slow. This will happen especially in West Germany, which was not traditionally their strong area.</p>
            <p>Next March, local elections will start in Bavaria, South Germany. In September next year, the state parliament election will be held in Saxony-Anhalt, Central Germany. The latest surveys show that the AfD now has 40% support in Saxony-Anhalt. This is more than the ruling CDU party.</p>
            <p>Kersting said that the election results in North Rhine-Westphalia gave the ruling CDU and SPD parties "a relatively safe pass." This gives the federal government six months without big elections to worry about. They can now focus on "autumn reform" plans. These include changes to citizen benefits, pensions, and healthcare.</p>
            <p>Kersting warned that major parties must offer better solutions for immigration and social inequality. Only then can they stop extreme right-wing groups from getting stronger in "Rust Belt" areas, where factories have closed.</p>
