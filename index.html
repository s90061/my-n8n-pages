Chunghwa Telecom's chairman, Chien Chih-cheng, held a press conference today. He stated that almost all government websites, 99.9% of 11,800, have updated their security certificates or now use two certificates. This comes after a lawmaker, Ko Ru-chun, criticized Chunghwa Telecom, saying that Google and Mozilla no longer trust their website security certificates.

Mr. Chien explained that Chunghwa Telecom's certificates will not stop working after July 31st. He also said that this issue is about legal identification for websites and does not affect national security. He mentioned that Mozilla's certificate update is a global rule for older certificate centers to update by April 15, 2025, and Chunghwa Telecom is following this.

He clarified that the lawmaker's claim that 14 government departments, including the Ministry of Digital Affairs, still use old Chunghwa Telecom certificates without an automatic switch is incorrect. Mr. Chien said that nearly all government websites have updated their certificates or use two, with only seven still in the process. He added that if someone deletes the certificate, it's like destroying their own ID, and it's not a problem with the certificate itself.
