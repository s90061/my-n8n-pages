As schools began their summer holiday, New Taipei City Mayor Hou You-yi visited the Sanchong Police Station on the evening of June 30th to launch the "Youth Project." He then led police officers to inspect a KTV. Mayor Hou You-yi stated that it is important to take actions to ensure the safety of young people.

Mayor Hou You-yi visited the Sanchong Police Station to check on the "Youth Project" for the summer of 2025, which focuses on inspecting key businesses. He listened to a briefing from the police before going to a KTV, a place where young people often gather, for an inspection.

Mayor Hou You-yi mentioned that the public is very concerned about youth crime, especially the increase in young people involved in fraud. The city government will continue to improve crime prevention measures and educate young people about avoiding fraud. Recently, various government departments have worked together to check places selling e-cigarettes and to remove illegal buildings in high-crime areas. The city hopes to keep working hard to provide a good environment for young people to grow up in.

New Taipei City Police Chief Liao Hsun-cheng said that they chose the first day of summer vacation to start the "Youth Project" inspection. They also did wider inspections across all districts of the city. Besides fighting fraud groups and preventing young people from being used by them, they will also increase efforts to find drugs, e-cigarettes, and stop driving under the influence of drugs. They will also keep track of gang members and stop their money flow to make New Taipei City safer.

The New Taipei City Government announced that the "Youth Project" will run from July 1st to August 31st. Departments like education, social affairs, health, economic development, fire safety, and public works, along with local police stations, will form inspection teams. They will ensure the safety of places young people visit and reduce incidents of harm.

**Green Island Submarine Chen Shih-chan Picked by Rakuten Monkeys; Many Years of Effort for This Moment**

Chen Shih-chan, known as the "Green Island Submarine" for his unique pitching style, was chosen by the Rakuten Monkeys in the third round of the 2025 Chinese Professional Baseball League draft. Chen Shih-chan, who graduated from Taitung Sports High School, said that after many years of hard work, he finally reached this important moment. He was not always expected to succeed, but now he has the chance to play professional baseball. He hopes to learn from Huang Tzu-peng, a senior player with a similar pitching style, when he joins the Rakuten Monkeys.

Chen Shih-chan, who is from Green Island, Taitung County, left home in elementary school to play baseball at Fengtian Elementary School in Taitung City. Because of his body type, his elementary school coach suggested he try a "submarine" or "underhand" pitching style to be more effective. This helped him succeed. Last year, he was chosen for the Asian Youth Baseball Championship team, and this year, he was selected for the U18 World Cup Baseball training team.

Chen Shih-chan said that during each round of the draft, he wondered if he would be chosen. When he heard his name, a big weight was lifted from his shoulders. He added that no matter who it is, after so many years of hard work, this moment, seeing their name on the screen, is what they worked for.

Chen Shih-chan left Green Island to play baseball when he was young. He faced being excluded and looked down upon, but he overcame it all and slowly got better at the sport. He performed well on the international stage and was noticed by professional baseball teams. He said he still can't quite believe it.

Chen Shih-chan said that when he joins the Rakuten Monkeys, he wants to learn from Huang Tzu-peng, who is also a low-arm sidearm pitcher. He often watches videos of pitchers with similar styles, and Huang Tzu-peng is one he frequently watches and learns from. He believes that asking questions and learning a lot in the team, and not being afraid of hard work, will help him in the future.

Chen Shih-chan's father, mother, and sister were there to support him. His father was famous for doing a "strikeout dance" at last year's Asian Youth Baseball Championship. Chen Shih-chan said that when he was picked in the draft and stood up, his father asked him if he wanted to do the "strikeout dance," but he refused. He said he was too nervous and his legs were still shaking.

**European Commission: US Trade Talks Do Not Include EU Tech Rules**

Brussels (Central News Agency) â€“ The European Union (EU) on Monday pushed back against criticism from the United States regarding its important technology laws. Many people were worried that these laws might be part of ongoing trade talks with the US and could be weakened.

According to Reuters, the EU passed the Digital Markets Act in recent years. This law aims to limit the power of big tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, China's ByteDance, and Booking.com.

Another law, the Digital Services Act, requires large online platforms to do more to fight illegal and harmful content. Both of these tech laws have been criticized by the US government, which says they unfairly target American tech companies.

Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said in a regular press conference, "These laws will not change. Neither the Digital Markets Act nor the Digital Services Act are part of the trade talks with the United States."

He also added that the EU will not allow foreign governments to interfere with how it applies these important laws. Under these laws, the EU can fine companies that break them a lot of money.
