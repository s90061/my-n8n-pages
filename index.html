            <h1>Taichung Police Catch Foreign Women in Sex Trade; One Claimed to Be an "Active Adult Film Actress"</h1>
            <p>The Taichung City Police Department announced today that they caught foreign women who came to Taiwan as tourists to do sex work. Besides women from Thailand, there were also three Japanese women. One of them said she was an "active adult film actress" and charged NT$20,000 for her services.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Division of the Taichung City Police Department explained that recently, 22 police officers used a search warrant from the Taichung District Court. They checked short-term apartments and hotels in the Xitun District for illegal sex work. They found women doing sex work in an auto motel. They also found a woman who seemed to be an "active adult film actress."</p>
            <p>During their search, police found some Taiwanese and Thai women who were in the middle of a transaction. They also found three Japanese women in the same motel. One of them claimed to be an "active adult film actress." Police saw her room had personal items and an open suitcase. This showed she was using the place to stay for a short time and do sex work.</p>
            <p>Police said that they learned the service cost between NT$4,000 and NT$5,000 for 50 minutes. The Japanese women charged a higher price of NT$20,000. They said this was because they were "active actresses" with "films." However, when the police came, no sex acts were happening in the room. The Japanese woman was sitting on the bed, dressed and ready for a customer. It seemed that the high price might have made customers not want to pay.</p>
            <p>Police said that in this operation, they caught 15 people in total. This included Taiwanese, Thai, and Japanese women, as well as staff members. The people running the illegal business rented hotel rooms to sell sex. They used messaging apps to talk to customers and avoid being caught. Many foreign women came to Taiwan with tourist visas. They pretended to be tourists but were actually doing sex work. The police will fine these people for breaking the "Social Order Maintenance Act" and send them to the immigration agency.</p>
            <p>Zhou Jun-ming, the chief of the Sixth Division, asked illegal businesses not to think they can get away with it. He said they should not use hotels or pretend to be tourists to hide illegal sex work. The police will continue to find evidence and act to keep Taichung safe. This will help maintain Taichung's good image and ensure citizens can live without worry.</p>

            <h1>Trump: If Putin Doesn't Agree to Ukraine Ceasefire, I Plan Economic Sanctions on Russia</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump said today that he is ready to put economic sanctions on Russia. This will happen if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to stop fighting in the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Trump answered a reporter's question about whether Putin would face consequences. He said, "If I have to do it, the sanctions I am thinking about are very, very serious. But I want to see the war endâ€¦ We have economic sanctions. I am talking about economic things because we will not get involved in a world war."</p>
            <p>Trump has recently tried to end the war, which has lasted more than three years. But his attempts to help have not worked so far. He has not used the sanctions he warned Putin about for a long time.</p>
            <p>Trump wants Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin to talk directly, just the two of them. Zelenskyy has said yes to this idea, but Putin has not agreed yet. The Kremlin said there are no plans for such a meeting right now.</p>
            <p>Trump said during a White House meeting with his cabinet, "This will not be a world war, but it will be an economic warâ€¦ An economic war will be very bad, bad for Russia, and I don't want that."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Zelenskyy is also not completely innocent."</p>
            <p>Even though diplomatic progress is slow, officials from the US and Europe have discussed giving security promises to Kyiv if a deal is made. Possible ideas include air support or sharing information.</p>
            <p>Trump has often suggested using economic tools to pressure countries at war. From August 27, he plans to add a 25% tax on goods that India sells to the US. This is to punish India for continuing to buy Russian oil. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil.</p>
            <p>Trump also said today that he might use "very expensive and strong taxes on goods from Russia or Ukraine" to bring peace.</p>
