            <h1>Macau Badminton Open: Li Fang-jen, Li Fang-chih advance to men's doubles last 16</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 29 (CNA) The Macau Badminton Open, a BWF Super 300 event, started today. Taiwanese twin brothers, Li Fang-jen and Li Fang-chih, won their first men's doubles match. In the round of 32, they beat the Indonesian team of Raymond Indra and Nikolaus Joaquin with scores of 21-13 and 21-14. They have now moved on to the last 16.</p>
            <p>In early July this year, Li Fang-jen and Li Fang-chih won the men's doubles title at the Canada Open, which is also a Super 300 event. They are currently ranked 20th in the world. This was their first time playing against Raymond Indra and Nikolaus Joaquin, who are ranked 103rd in the world.</p>
            <p>Even though they had never played each other before, Li Fang-jen and Li Fang-chih slowly got ahead after the score was 7-7 in the first game. After the technical break at 11-10, they scored 6 points to 1, which helped them win the first game.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Li Fang-jen and Li Fang-chih started to understand how their opponents played. After the score was 3-3, they got ahead. They used their strong flat drives to get a lead. When the score was 9-8, they scored 9 points to 1 again. They won the match in two straight games, just as they wanted.</p>

            <h1>Marcos Accused of Softening Towards China, Philippine Officials: South China Sea Stance Unchanged</h1>
            <p>Manila, July 29 (CNA) Yesterday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. gave his annual speech to the country. Some people think his speech showed he is less strong against China. But today, officials from the Philippine President's office and the military said that the Philippines' position on the South China Sea has not changed. They said the country will continue to protect its power and rights.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, President Marcos gave his fourth annual speech in the House of Representatives. He did not talk about the South China Sea issue. He said again that the Philippines wants to be "friends with everyone and not be enemies with anyone." He also said that the country will "be careful and patient" when protecting its land and national interests.</p>
            <p>In his speech, which lasted about 1 hour and 10 minutes, President Marcos did not clearly mention the disagreement between the Philippines and China over the South China Sea. Some people thought this meant he was becoming less strict with China. They were worried he might give up some of the country's claims in the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>Today, Lucas Bersamin, who works for the President's office, answered questions from Philippine reporters. He said that the Philippine government's position on the "West Philippine Sea" has not changed. He added that the government is not unsure about its position.</p>
            <p>Bersamin said that the Philippines is still friendly with China, but China must also be friendly in return. He said that if China continues to go against the Philippines' power, President Marcos "will certainly not welcome" it.</p>
            <p>President Marcos first talked about being friendly with others and not making enemies in his first speech to the country in July 2022. But he has also said many times in public speeches that the country will "not give up one inch" of its land.</p>
            <p>Also, Francel Margareth Padilla, a spokesperson for the Philippine military, promised today at a regular press conference that the military will "continue as always" to protect the country's power. She also said that President Marcos's instructions on this are very clear.</p>
            <p>One week before giving his speech, President Marcos visited the United States. During a press conference there, Donald Trump said that the U.S. does not care if the Philippines is friends with China. He said that the Philippines' foreign policy is its own, and it can do anything to become great again.</p>
            <p>The Philippines claims it has the right to use the resources in an exclusive economic zone that goes 200 nautical miles into the South China Sea. This is based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Philippines calls this area the "West Philippine Sea."</p>
            <p>China, on the other hand, claims most of the South China Sea using a 10-dash line and historical reasons. This area overlaps with the sea area claimed by the Philippines. For many years, the two countries have had many conflicts in this disputed area. The Philippine Navy, Coast Guard, and Bureau of Fisheries have often said that Chinese ships have hit their boats, sprayed strong water at them, and stopped their fishing and science activities.</p>
