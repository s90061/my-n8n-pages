Original URL: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-69022633

After the pandemic, city centres across the UK are slowly getting busier again. Many people thought that the rise of online shopping and working from home would mean the end of vibrant high streets. However, new research suggests that city centres are attracting more visitors, though not always for the same reasons as before.

People are now visiting city centres not just to shop, but also for social activities, food, and entertainment. There's a growing trend towards creating more mixed-use spaces that include housing, cultural events, and restaurants, alongside traditional shops. This helps to create a more lively atmosphere, especially after normal working hours. Some areas are seeing success by focusing on unique local businesses and community events rather than just big chain stores.

Despite this positive trend, challenges remain. Many city centres still have empty shops and offices, and it can be hard to attract new businesses. Local councils and developers are trying new ideas to fill these spaces, sometimes turning them into residential areas or community hubs. The aim is to make city centres places where people want to live, work, and spend their free time, ensuring they remain important parts of our daily lives.

**More US Companies Want Workers Back in the Office**

A new report shows that more and more companies in the United States are asking their employees to return to the office for more days each week. This trend is a clear shift from the widespread remote work that became common during the pandemic. Many businesses are now trying to find a balance between working from home and being in the office.

The report found that most companies now require employees to be in the office for at least some days. Only a small percentage of firms still offer full-time remote work. Some companies even see the push for office returns as a way to reduce staff without directly firing people, hoping that some employees will leave if they don't like the new rules.

This move back to the office is happening across various industries, including technology and finance. Business leaders believe that working together in person can improve teamwork, innovation, and company culture. Experts expect this trend of increasing office presence to continue throughout the year.

**Hawaii Considers New Fee for Tourists to Combat Overtourism**
Original URL: https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/hawaii-visitor-fee-overtourism

Hawaii is considering a new plan that would ask tourists to pay an extra fee when they visit the islands. This proposed charge, often called a "climate impact fee," aims to help manage the effects of tourism and protect Hawaii's natural environment. If approved, the money collected from visitors would go towards conservation efforts and improving local infrastructure.

The idea comes as many popular places in Hawaii are dealing with "overtourism," which means too many visitors are putting a strain on the environment and local resources. The beautiful beaches, hiking trails, and natural sites are facing damage from heavy foot traffic and increased waste. Supporters of the fee believe it's a fair way for visitors to contribute to the preservation of the very things they come to Hawaii to enjoy.

This type of tourist fee is not new; other popular destinations around the world, like Venice in Italy or New Zealand, have similar charges in place. The bill for the Hawaii fee has already passed the state legislature and is now waiting for the governor's final decision. If signed into law, it would be a significant step in how Hawaii manages its valuable tourism industry.`;
