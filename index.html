**Diddy Found Not Guilty of Serious Charges**

Sean "Diddy" Combs, a famous American rapper, was found not guilty of serious crimes like racketeering and sex trafficking in New York. However, he was found guilty of two less serious crimes: transporting people for prostitution. For each of these, he could go to prison for up to 10 years.

The jury thought about the case for 13 hours. When the judge read the decision, Diddy seemed very relieved. His family and lawyers were happy and showed it. Diddy said thank you to the jury. Prosecutors had said Diddy led a criminal group for many years, but Diddy said he did not do anything wrong.

**Trump Announces New Trade Deal with Vietnam**

Bloomberg reports that former US President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam today. Under this agreement, goods from Vietnam sent to the United States will have a 20% tax. However, goods that pass through Vietnam from places like China will have a higher 40% tax. This means products with parts from China, which are sent through Vietnam with only a little final work done there, will pay 40% tax.

Trump also said that Vietnam has agreed to stop all taxes on goods from the United States. The special list of goods for the 40% tax is not yet public. This deal happened after talks between Trump and Vietnam's top leader, To Lam. Vietnam is an important partner for the US, and its products are used by many American buyers. Many factories have moved from China to Vietnam, which has made Vietnam's exports to the US grow a lot. After Trump's announcement, the prices of furniture and clothing company stocks went up.
