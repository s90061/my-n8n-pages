            <h1>High Temperatures Expected This Weekend; Rain to Increase from August 17, with Heavy Rain Possible in the South</h1>
            <p>The Weather Agency said that high temperatures will be strong for the next two days, this weekend. In western Taiwan, temperatures will mostly be around 34 or 35 degrees Celsius. Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Tainan areas might even reach 37 degrees. Tomorrow afternoon, there could be heavy local rain south of Chiayi. From August 17 to 19, there will be more moisture in the air. In the afternoon, western Taiwan and all mountain areas might have heavy local rain. Southern Taiwan could even have very heavy local rain.</p>
            <p>Weather forecaster Chang Chun-yao told CNA reporters that tomorrow will be sunny to partly cloudy. Keelung's north coast and Hengchun Peninsula will have a few short rain showers. In the afternoon, areas south of Nantou and Yunlin, flat areas near mountains in the central and northern parts, and mountain areas in eastern Taiwan will have local thunderstorms. Among these, areas south of Chiayi might have heavy local rain.</p>
            <p>Chang Chun-yao said that from August 17 to 19, clouds from the south will move north. This will bring more moisture everywhere. Taitung and Pingtung will have short rain showers or thunderstorms. In the afternoon, western Taiwan and all mountain areas will have heavy local rain. Southern Taiwan might have very heavy local rain. From early morning to noon, western Taiwan will have a few short rain showers.</p>
            <p>Chang Chun-yao also said that from August 20 to 22, there will be less moisture. The weather will become partly cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, western Taiwan and mountain areas in eastern Taiwan will have local short thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Chang Chun-yao mentioned that high temperatures will be more noticeable this weekend. Generally, eastern Taiwan will be around 31 to 33 degrees. Western Taiwan will be 34 or 35 degrees. Northern Taiwan and areas near mountains in the south might reach 36 degrees. Tomorrow, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Tainan should watch out for temperatures around 37 degrees.</p>
            <p>Chang Chun-yao added that in the next week, there might be a tropical disturbance in the South China Sea and east of Taiwan (east of the Philippines). The conditions east of Taiwan are not very good, so it might only be a normal low-pressure system moving north, bringing some moisture to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>As for the disturbance in the South China Sea, it might get stronger. Chang Chun-yao said that currently, different countries expect it to move towards the Indochina Peninsula. It will not directly affect Taiwan. However, regarding its strength, European and American forecasts are different. Europe expects it to be weak, but America thinks it might become a typhoon. AI models, though, think it will only be a tropical depression. We need to keep watching it.</p>
            <p>Chang Chun-yao reminded people that tomorrow, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Pingtung, and Taitung might have strong winds of about level 8. Taipei city area will also have stronger winds.</p>

            <h1>Lawmaker Says Presidential Office Sent Letter to Review Failed Recall; Office Calls It Public Fabrication</h1>
            <p>A lawmaker said that the Presidential Office sent a letter to the Executive Yuan to review why the "726 recall" failed. Presidential Office spokesperson Kuo Ya-hui said today that this is a public lie, mixing different things together. She said that the document is just a regular monthly report from the Presidential Office's Public Affairs Department. It collects public opinions. All the information in it shows what people care about. It is not, as some people wrongly say, a list of "tasks ordered by the Presidential Office and Executive Yuan."</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei, a lawmaker from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, claimed that "the Presidential Office sent a letter to the Executive Yuan asking to review the failure of the 726 recall." She also said that the document was the "first official proof that the big recall failed." Kuo Ya-hui said this afternoon that this is a public lie and does not match the truth at all. The document Wang Hung-wei talked about is the Presidential Office's Public Affairs Department's "monthly regular collection of public complaints." It lists many important issues and opinions that people have raised. After collecting them, the document is sent to the Executive Yuan every month for their reference. The claim that "the Presidential Office sent a letter to the Executive Yuan asking for a review" is completely false.</p>
            <p>Kuo Ya-hui said it is a pity that Wang Hung-wei might have taken only one small part, the second item, first point, from the public's feedback for a special reason. By using this small part, she wrongly accused the Presidential Office of telling the Executive Yuan to review the recall movement. In truth, the main topic of the document clearly states "Important Issues the Public Cared About in July this year." The document lists eight items in detail, all of which are clearly just a collection of issues that people complained about.</p>
            <p>She asked politicians not to say things that are not true. She asked them not to take things out of context and mislead the public.</p>

            <h1>The Economist: Western Countries Have Many Ways to Avoid China's Rare Earth Control</h1>
            <p>The Economist magazine recently wrote that China seems to be using rare earth minerals to put economic pressure on other countries. But Western countries are working hard to become less dependent on China. They are doing this by producing their own rare earths, recycling magnets, and making motors that do not need rare earths at all. The more China tries to use its market power, the more other countries will try to find ways around it.</p>
            <p>The article said that China seems to be using rare earths to pressure other countries economically. On one hand, rare earths are different from other important materials China makes a lot of, like copper and lithium, because China does not need to import raw materials to produce rare earths. On the other hand, it costs very little for China to limit rare earth exports, but it can stop whole industries in other countries from working.</p>
            <p>Since early April this year, China started controlling rare earth exports. This made some car factories in other countries stop production. Western companies and officials quickly started talking with China. Some companies agreed to give sensitive business information, like technical drawings, to get permission to export.</p>
            <p>In June this year, the approval of export permits, especially for magnets, started to become faster. But the amount exported was still low and changed a lot. German companies got more magnet export permits than American companies. Indian car makers, who have tense relations with China, seemed to be at the back of the line for applications.</p>
            <p>Even if China's rare earth exports go back to normal levels, it might take many months to fill up supplies again. Also, some permits are only good for 6 months. After that, buyers must apply again, and the rules might change again.</p>
            <p>However, the article pointed out that Western leaders see China's threat as serious. So, they have started trying to become less dependent on China.</p>
            <p>Experts from the "Center for Strategic and International Studies" (CSIS), a think tank in Washington, said that the United States is making a "whole-of-government effort" to rely less on China for rare earths. For example, the Mountain Pass mine in California started working again in 2018. Last year, it produced 47,000 tons of light rare earth oxides. Its goal is to produce 60,000 tons by 2030. The US Department of Defense has promised to ensure a minimum price for its production, which is higher than before China limited exports.</p>
            <p>Also, Lynas Rare Earths from Australia, with help from the US and Japanese governments, started making heavy rare earths in Malaysia in May. This makes it the first company outside China to produce them for sale. The European Union also said it would support rare earth projects in Malawi and South Africa in Africa. There are hundreds more projects being thought about worldwide.</p>
            <p>However, most of these plans will not start for several years. And China produces rare earths very efficiently, making it hard to compete with them. It is also hard to guess how long China's rare earth limits will last. This makes it difficult for foreign mines to get a lot of money to start their projects.</p>
            <p>The article also said that another way to deal with China's rare earth limits is recycling. Right now, this is done on a very small scale. The founder of Caremag, a new rare earth company, said that recycling magnets is "the richest ore we know of."</p>
            <p>The European Union, which does not have rare earth mines, especially wants to develop the recycling industry. Last year, it passed a law to get 25% of its need for rare earths and other important minerals from recycling by 2030. A Canadian company called Cyclic Materials is also building two factories. These factories can make 500 tons of recycled rare earths each year, including heavy rare earths.</p>
            <p>The article also mentioned that some companies, like electric car makers, might be able to use less rare earth. A German car parts company has made a motor that does not need rare earths at all. They plan to make it in large numbers by 2028.</p>
            <p>Finally, the article said that Western countries do not need to make local products that completely replace China's rare earth industry. This would be very expensive and need endless money from the government.</p>
            <p>An expert said that if they can just lower their dependence on China to 60% to 70% of what they use, the risk will go down a lot. The more China tries to use its market power, the more other parts of the world will try to find ways around it. The only way China can keep its control for a long time is by keeping rare earths cheap and easy to get.</p>
