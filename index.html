            <h1>Naomi Osaka Wins and Will Play Coco Gauff at US Open</h1>
            <p>Naomi Osaka, a former US Open women's singles champion, won a tough 3-set match today against Australian player Daria Kasatkina. This is her first time reaching the fourth round of the US Open in five years. Next, she will play against the new American star, Coco Gauff.</p>
            <p>The last time Naomi Osaka reached the fourth round of the US Open was in 2020. That year, she won the women's singles title. Today, she won her match against the 15th seed, Daria Kasatkina. Kasatkina had some problems with her serves. Osaka won with scores of 6-0, 4-6, 6-3.</p>
            <p>This victory is her best result in a Grand Slam singles tournament since she had a baby in 2023 and returned to playing last year.</p>
            <p>She said, "This journey has been very long, but I am happy to be here now." This will be the first time Naomi Osaka has reached the second week of a Grand Slam tournament since she won the Australian Open in 2021.</p>
            <p>Naomi Osaka said she is excited to play against Coco Gauff, who won the US Open women's singles title in 2023. Osaka sees Gauff like a "little sister."</p>
            <p>When Naomi Osaka talked about her match with Gauff, she joked with the audience, "Can anyone come and watch this match and cheer for me? It's a bit hard to play against an American here."</p>
            <p>Coco Gauff, the third seed in the tournament, played much better today after some difficult matches in earlier rounds. She easily beat Polish player Magdalena Frech in two sets to reach the top 16 in the US Open women's singles.</p>
            <p>On August 28th, Gauff had a very tough match against Croatian player Donna Vekic and even cried on the court. But today, she showed her best performance at the US Open. It only took her 1 hour and 13 minutes to win against the 28th seed, Magdalena Frech, with scores of 6-3, 6-1.</p>

            <h1>Yemen Houthi Group Vows Revenge After Prime Minister and Officials Killed in Israeli Airstrike</h1>
            <p>A news agency run by Yemen's Houthi group reported today that their Prime Minister and other ministers died in an Israeli airstrike on Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. Mahdi al-Mashat, the leader of the Supreme Political Council, made a statement saying the group promises to get revenge.</p>
            <p>The report also said that many people were hurt in the attack on August 28th, but it did not give more details.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army also confirmed tonight that they killed Ahmed al-Rahawi, the Houthi government's Prime Minister, and other important officials.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Israel announced that these airstrikes were aimed at high-ranking officials of the Houthi group, which is connected to Iran. These officials included their chief of staff and defense minister.</p>
            <p>However, Mahdi al-Mashat's statement did not clearly say if the Houthi defense minister was among those killed or injured.</p>
            <p>Mahdi al-Mashat shared a video on Telegram. In the video, he said, "We promise to Allah, to the dear people of Yemen, and to the families of the dead and injured that we will get revenge."</p>
            <p>He also told foreign businesses to leave Israel soon, "before it is too late."</p>
            <p>Al-Rahawi became Prime Minister almost a year ago, but his deputy, Mohamed Moftah, was the real leader of the government. Today, Moftah was asked to be the acting Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>Al-Rahawi was mostly just a leader in name. He was not a key member of the Houthi group's main leadership.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said that their warplanes attacked a place in the Sanaa area where high-ranking Houthi officials were meeting. They called this attack a "complex operation." It was successful because they gathered information and had strong air power.</p>
            <p>On August 28th, Israeli security sources said that the attack targeted several places where many high-ranking Houthi officials had gathered. They were watching a TV speech by their leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi.</p>
            <p>The Houthi group, which is connected to Iran, has attacked ships in the Red Sea. They said they did this to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>They have also fired missiles at Israel. Most of these missiles were stopped. In response, Israel attacked areas in Yemen controlled by the Houthi group, including the important port of Hodeidah.</p>

            <h1>Big Sinkhole in Norway Swallows Part of Road and Railway, One Worker Dies</h1>
            <p>Today, authorities in Norway said that a big sinkhole appeared in an area near a town north of Oslo, the capital. The ground fell in, and parts of a road and a railway were swallowed. One person died because of this.</p>
            <p>Pictures in Norwegian news showed that the sinkhole is tens of meters wide. It affected both sides of the E6 highway in Levanger town and the railway tracks next to the road. Levanger is about 500 kilometers north of Oslo, Norway's capital.</p>
            <p>Norwegian police stated that a Danish worker who went missing at the accident site is now believed to be dead.</p>
            <p>The state-owned company that manages Norway's railway system told NRK, a Norwegian broadcasting company, that they were doing work to make the soil stronger along the railway tracks before this happened.</p>
            <p>The company said it is too early to know if this strengthening work caused the sinkhole.</p>
            <p>NTB, a Norwegian news agency, reported that experts said the soil in that area is mostly made of clay. This type of soil can cause sinkholes to happen.</p>
            <p>The authorities have moved people out of two houses near where the accident happened.</p>
            <p>The Norwegian Road Administration announced that the E6 highway around the accident area will be closed for several days.</p>
