            <h1>US Lawmakers Suggest Stronger Defense Tech Ties Between US and Taiwan to Counter China's Threat</h1>
            <p>A group of lawmakers from different political parties in the United States suggested a new law this week. This law would ask the U.S. Department of Defense to work closely with Taiwan. The goal is to make both their defense industries stronger. This is to help against the threats from China's military technology. The law says they should work together on things like drones, computer chips, and missile systems.</p>
            <p>Today, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party in the U.S. House of Representatives put out a press release. It said that John Moolenaar, who leads the committee and is a Republican, along with Republican lawmaker Zach Nunn and Democratic lawmaker Jill Tokuda, all suggested this law this week. The law asks the U.S. Department of Defense to start an official partnership with Taiwan.</p>
            <p>This new law is called the "U.S.-Taiwan Defense Innovation Partnership Act." The press release explained that the law wants defense companies in the U.S. and Taiwan to work together on research and development. This will help stop China's progress in military technology that can be used for both military and non-military purposes.</p>
            <p>The law states that they will work together on developing drones, computer chips, artificial intelligence, and missile systems.</p>
            <p>Moolenaar said that over time, Chinese President Xi Jinping has put more pressure on Taiwan. He said, "This law will make our work with Taiwan stronger in important defense areas. It will also make us better prepared together to deal with Beijing, which is becoming more of a threat."</p>
            <p>Nunn also said that this defense partnership will be a very important tool to stop threats. He said it will "help Taiwan get new American technology faster. It will also give Taiwan a special advantage it needs to protect itself."</p>

            <h1>Unstable Weather: Heavy Rain Expected in Mountains South of Chiayi, Brief Showers North of Hsinchu</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, August 2) The Weather Administration said that today, the southwest wind will get stronger. This means the weather will not be stable. There will likely be heavy rain for short periods. Areas south of Chiayi will have showers or thunderstorms. Areas from Miaoli to Yunlin and the mountains in the southeast will have heavy rain or very heavy local rain. There is a chance of very heavy rain or more in the mountain areas south of Chiayi.</p>
            <p>Also, the Weather Administration said that areas north of Hsinchu and in the southeast will have some brief showers or thunderstorms. In the afternoon, there might be some heavy rain in these areas too. Other areas will be partly cloudy, with some brief thunderstorms in the afternoon. People should carry an umbrella when they go outside.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration reminded everyone that because it has been raining for several days, people in mountain areas should be careful of landslides, falling rocks, mudslides, and rivers rising quickly. Low-lying areas should watch out for standing water and floods. Please be sure to stay safe when you go out.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, the highest temperatures in central and southern Taiwan, and in Hualien and Taitung, will be around 29 to 31 degrees Celsius. Other areas will have temperatures around 33 to 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>For the islands, Penghu will be cloudy with brief showers or thunderstorms, and temperatures from 27 to 30 degrees Celsius. Kinmen will be partly cloudy, with temperatures from 27 to 32 degrees Celsius. Matsu will be partly cloudy, with temperatures from 28 to 32 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration said that the southwest wind is strong. Today and tomorrow, parts of Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, Lanyu, Green Island, Kinmen, and Matsu might have winds of level 6 or higher, or gusts of level 8 or higher. Also, there is a chance of long waves in the southeast (Green Island, Lanyu) and along the southern coast. Waves could be 2 to 3 meters high. Please be careful if you are doing activities near the sea.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration stated that Typhoon Krosa, the 9th typhoon, was about 2240 kilometers northeast of Taipei at 2 AM today. It is moving towards the northeast and then east-northeast. It will not directly affect Taiwan. Also, Tropical Depression number 13 was about 1510 kilometers east of Taipei at 2 AM today. It is moving northeast towards the sea southeast of Japan and might become a weak typhoon.</p>
            <p>In addition, information from the Ministry of Environment's air quality forecast shows that today, because of the southwest wind and the rain clearing the air, the air quality will mostly be good to fair. In the northern part, where the wind blows towards, pollutants might collect a bit more easily. The air quality in Hsinchu-Miaoli, Central, Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan, Yilan, Hualien-Taitung areas, and Penghu will be "Good." The air quality in Northern, Kaohsiung-Pingtung areas, Matsu, and Kinmen will be "Fair."
