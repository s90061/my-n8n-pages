            <h1>TSMC's German Factory Needs 5,000 Workers, Pushing for English Reforms in German Vocational Education</h1>
            <p>TSMC's German factory will start making products in 2027. It will need at least 5,000 skilled workers. To get international students and solve the worker shortage, the government of Saxony is building a vocational school where all classes will be taught in English. This will be the first school like this in Germany. It will change the traditional German vocational education system, which mainly uses German.</p>
            <p>Last August, European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) started building its factory in Saxony, Germany. TSMC and other European chip makers like Infineon own ESMC together. The factory is expected to start production in 2027 and will need about 5,000 skilled workers.</p>
            <p>To meet this need for workers, the government of Saxony, ESMC, and the local Chamber of Commerce (IHK) are working together. They are building a new vocational school in Saxony. This school will offer courses related to semiconductors, taught completely in English. They hope to attract young people from nearby countries like Poland and the Czech Republic, and even from further away, to train in Germany.</p>
            <p>Conrad Clemens, the Minister of Education for Saxony, said that Saxony is becoming more international because TSMC and other global companies are coming there. He said, "TSMC brings a big chance to the area. Now is the right time for our vocational training to change and offer English classes."</p>
            <p>The new school will cost about 140 million Euros (about 5 billion New Taiwan Dollars). The European Union will give 100 million Euros. The school is expected to open in 2029. It will have a six-story building, a gym, and a swimming pool. Big chip makers plan to hire 1,000 apprentices each year.</p>
            <p>Germany has a long history of apprenticeship programs and values vocational education. Most vocational schools (Teilzeitberufsschule) use a "dual system." In this system, apprentices spend 70% of their time working at a company and 30% studying at school. This way, they learn both practical skills and theory. According to Statista, Germany currently has about 3,400 dual-system vocational schools. Last year, over 450,000 people chose this type of training.</p>
            <p>Unlike vocational high schools in Taiwan, German students can usually sign an apprenticeship contract with a company and enroll in a vocational school at the same time, starting around 15 or 16 years old after finishing their full-time compulsory education. There is no strict age limit for apprenticeships. It is common for people in their 20s or 30s to start vocational training.</p>
            <p>But a vocational school taught entirely in English is still new in Germany. After the news about the new English school came out, the German Federal Ministry of Education also told Handelsblatt newspaper that no public vocational school in Germany has ever used only English for teaching.</p>
            <p>Even though this new plan is getting attention, there are still many problems to solve. First, according to German law, final vocational school exams must be in German. To change this to English, the law needs to be updated. Also, school materials, courses, exam questions, and teacher training all need to be translated and changed. This is a big challenge for the education system.</p>
            <p>The Chamber of Commerce pointed out that in the past, some schools tried to teach in English. But most of them failed because they did not have enough teachers or learning materials. Also, many small and medium-sized companies still mainly use German for work. Not all employees know English well. So, these companies are worried that it will be hard to compete with larger companies for international apprentices.</p>
            <p>To help different companies, the government of Saxony plans to offer "bilingual education" for some technical jobs, like microelectronics engineers. Some classes will be taught in English, and German training will be included. This will help international students learn skills and also get used to German at the same time.</p>
            <p>Christian Koitzsch, the president of ESMC, said that international teams are normal in the semiconductor industry. Training in English will help the company stay strong in the global market.</p>
            <p>Infineon, a big German chip maker, also believes that English is often used at work. They will offer language courses and help with living for international apprentices. This will help them finish their training and live well in the local area.</p>
            <p>Even with many legal and practical challenges, the Saxony government and businesses are determined to make these changes. Local officials said, "If we don't try, we will never know if it works. The city government, the Chamber of Commerce, and companies are all working together to make this new idea happen."</p>

            <h1>Giants Pitching Coach Remembers First Seeing 18-Year-Old Teng Kai-Wei: First Impression Was Amazing Talent for Controlling Ball Spin (Interview)</h1>
            <p>J.P. Martinez, the pitching coach for the San Francisco Giants in American professional baseball, might know Teng Kai-Wei better than anyone else on the team. Seven years ago, he met Teng Kai-Wei when he was 18 years old. His first thought was that Teng had "amazing talent for controlling the ball's spin, he could make the ball spin any way he wanted."</p>
            <p>Martinez, who is 43, has been a coach in professional baseball for 10 years. He joined the Minnesota Twins' minor league system in 2015 and used to be the team's assistant director for minor league pitchers. In 2021, he moved to the San Francisco Giants, where he worked as an assistant pitching coach for the main team. This year, he became the main pitching coach.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese pitcher Teng Kai-Wei joined the Twins in 2018. He started his career working with Martinez. For the next seven years, their paths in baseball often crossed.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Teng moved from the Twins to the Giants' system. In 2021, when he was asked to join the main team for spring training, Martinez coached him again. Last year, he played his first game in the main league, and this year he moved up to the main league again, working with Martinez for a second time.</p>
            <p>Martinez recently talked to CNA and said, "The world of baseball is really small. Working with a player from Taiwan, first in one place with one team in the United States, and then moving to another team in another place, and we still work together like always, that's really cool."</p>
            <p>Martinez remembered that seven years ago, when Teng Kai-Wei was 18, he flew from Taiwan to Florida. Martinez's first impression was that Teng had "amazing talent for controlling the ball's spin." Martinez remembered that Teng could throw many different kinds of pitches then. "It seemed like he could control the ball's spin however he wanted, and throw all sorts of pitches."</p>
            <p>Martinez said that over the years, as a coach, he has always helped Teng Kai-Wei find the best fastball for him. For a time, Teng used his four-seam fastball a lot. For another time, he threw many two-seam fastballs. Now, he mainly uses the four-seam fastball again.</p>
            <p>Martinez said that Teng Kai-Wei's four-seam fastball has a very good angle when it reaches the batter and moves upwards. This works well with his many different breaking balls.</p>
            <p>Being able to control breaking balls very well is a main part of Teng Kai-Wei's pitching. Martinez said, "Many pitchers have trouble with control. Coaches often tell them to throw more fastballs because most pitchers control their fastballs best. But Kai-Wei is the opposite. He controls his breaking balls best. This year, he used fastballs less than ever before, but his overall performance is the best it has ever been."</p>
            <p>Martinez said that the key to Teng Kai-Wei's control is not just about how he throws, but how he thinks when he faces a batter.</p>
            <p>He gave an example from a game against the Padres on August 13th at home. In that game, Teng Kai-Wei gave up 7 runs in 1.2 innings. However, Teng Kai-Wei threw his first pitch for a strike about 75% of the time in that game. But his strike rate for the whole game was only 60%. This means he often started by getting ahead in the count (throwing a strike early), but when it came time to finish the batter, he became a bit careful. He started throwing pitches close to the edges of the strike zone and was not brave enough to throw into the strike zone.</p>
            <p>Martinez believes that for Teng Kai-Wei to be successful as a pitcher, he needs to keep throwing his first pitch for a strike well. Also, as he throws more pitches and gets closer to getting the batter out, he needs to put pressure on the batter and aggressively throw pitches in the strike zone.</p>
            <p>Martinez has seen Teng Kai-Wei grow from an 18-year-old new player to a 26-year-old major league pitcher. He said that Teng Kai-Wei's improvement is clear. He is more mature, more aggressive when he pitches, controls his pitching actions better, and knows better how to use his different pitches to get batters out.</p>

            <h1>Pope Meets Israeli President, Says Two-State Solution is Only Path to Peace</h1>
            <p>Pope Leo XIV met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog today. During their meeting, they talked about the need for a quick stop to fighting in Gaza. They also said that aid must get into the area easily, all hostages should be freed, and that the "two-state solution" for Israel and Palestine is the only way to find peace.</p>
            <p>Pope Leo XIV met with Herzog today at the Apostolic Palace. After this, Herzog also met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who is the Vatican's Secretary of State, and Archbishop Paul R. Gallagher, who is the Vatican's Foreign Minister.</p>
            <p>The Vatican press office released a statement. It said that during the talks between the Pope, the Vatican, and the Israeli President, they focused on the political and social situation because of the conflict in the Middle East, "especially the terrible situation in Gaza."</p>
            <p>The Vatican's statement said that they hoped to "start talks again quickly." With international support, they believe they can free all hostages. They also want a quick and lasting stop to fighting, help for humanitarian aid to safely reach the worst-affected areas, full respect for human rights laws, and to meet the fair wishes of both peoples.</p>
            <p>The statement also mentioned how to ensure a good future for the Palestinian people and keep peace and stability in the region. The Vatican repeated its belief that the "two-state solution is the only way to end the current war."</p>
            <p>The Vatican's statement also said that they talked about the situation in the West Bank and the important issues in the city of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>After many countries said they might recognize the Palestinian state, Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, called on September 3rd for Israel to take over large parts of the West Bank. The United Arab Emirates then warned Israel that taking over any part of the West Bank would be a very serious problem for them.</p>
            <p>At the end of its statement, the Vatican said that both sides agreed on the long history and importance of the relationship between the Vatican and Israel. They also talked about the relationship between the local government and the church. They especially noted how important Christian groups are and how they help people and society in the area and across the Middle East. They help improve education, bring people together, and make the region more stable.</p>
