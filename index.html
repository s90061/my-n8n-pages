            <h1>Lin Chia-lung Visits Philippines, China Strongly Protests to Philippines</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Lin Chia-lung, visited the Philippines with a group of business people. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on August 29th that they are strongly against this visit. They have protested strongly to the Philippines in Beijing and Manila. China also warned that the Philippines "will pay a price" for going against China's rules.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a press release at 8 PM, responding to Lin Chia-lung's visit for the first time. They strongly criticized the Philippines.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Philippines "allowed" Lin Chia-lung to "visit" as a "head of a foundation." They claim this gave a platform for groups that want Taiwan to be separate from China to do anti-China activities. This goes against basic rules of international relations and the promises the Philippines made about Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson also said that the Philippines has recently done many wrong and challenging things about Taiwan. They have weakened the "One China" policy and hurt the relationship between China and the Philippines. This shows that the Philippine government "cannot be trusted." China is strongly against this and has made strong protests to the Philippines in Beijing and Manila.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that China wants the Philippines to follow the "One China" policy and the agreement made when China and the Philippines started diplomatic relations. China wants the Philippines to stop what it is doing and correct its mistakes. They must not play with fire when it comes to China's main interests. They should stop sending wrong messages to groups that want Taiwan to be separate from China. They should not think lightly of the Chinese people's strong will to protect their country's power and land.</p>
            <p>Finally, the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned that the Philippines "will definitely pay a price" for crossing China's red line. The Philippines must be responsible for all problems that come from this.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, China announced that it would send its military and coast guard to patrol the waters and airspace around Scarborough Shoal. This area has recently seen several conflicts with the Philippines.</p>
            <p>The Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) announced that they sent naval and air forces for "combat readiness patrols" around Scarborough Shoal and nearby areas today. They said that since June, the Southern Theater Command has continued to strengthen patrols and control over the waters and airspace around Scarborough Shoal. They want to protect China's power and safety and keep peace in the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>The China Coast Guard then announced that they conducted "law enforcement patrols" in the waters around Scarborough Shoal and nearby areas today. They stated that since August, the China Coast Guard has continued to strengthen law enforcement patrols in the waters around Scarborough Shoal and nearby areas. They have been tracking, watching, giving warnings, and stopping and sending away other ships according to the law. They want to strengthen control over these waters and protect China's land and sea rights.</p>
            <p>Recently, there have been many rumors on Chinese social media. People are saying that China has sent tugboats and might take action against the Philippine navy ship "BRP Sierra Madre," which has been stuck on Second Thomas Shoal for a long time. This ship is old and abandoned but has Philippine soldiers guarding it.</p>

            <h1>White House: Trump Revokes Kamala Harris's Secret Service Security Protection</h1>
            <p>A White House official said today that the government of President Trump has stopped the U.S. Secret Service from protecting former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that this decision by the Trump government ends the extended Secret Service protection that former President Joe Biden had approved for Kamala Harris.</p>
            <p>Kamala Harris, who was Vice President under Biden, usually had Secret Service protection for six months. This protection ended on July 21st. In the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Kamala Harris was the Democratic Party's candidate against the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.</p>

            <h1>Italian Prime Minister Meloni Has Fake Private Photos Spread Online, Calls on Other Affected Women to Report It</h1>
            <p>After fake private photos of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni were posted on a pornographic website, she asked women today to report it right away if they find their private photos shared online without their permission.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that many well-known women, including Meloni and Elly Schlein, who leads a left-wing opposition party, had fake photos of themselves appear on pornographic websites. Meloni told "Corriere della Sera" newspaper, "I feel disgusted by these things."</p>
            <p>These images were changed to make certain body parts look more sexual. They came from photos taken at political meetings and holiday pictures stolen from personal social media accounts.</p>
            <p>The platform, called Phica, had more than 700,000 users before it closed yesterday. It said it closed the website because users broke its rules. "Phica" is a slang word for female genitals in Italian.</p>
            <p>Last week, an Italian Facebook group called "My Wife" was also found and then closed. In this group, men would post pictures of their wives and write rude, sexist, and violent comments.</p>
            <p>Meloni said, "I want to show my support to all women who have been offended, shamed, and attacked."</p>
            <p>Italian police told AFP that they have received "many" reports about these types of websites and social media groups sharing private or fake images without people's permission.</p>
