The Gansu province government announced a higher-level investigation into the lead poisoning case at Heshidapeixin Kindergarten in Tianshui. This decision comes after public criticism in China. A new team, including experts from national ministries, will lead the investigation, and the results will be shared with the public.

Many people are unhappy because the authorities still call it "abnormal blood lead" instead of "lead poisoning." The new investigation team will include top officials and various departments. Experts from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the National Health Commission will also join. The State Council's Food Safety Commission will guide the process.

This case came to light when 233 children from the kindergarten showed high lead levels after their parents took them to a hospital in Xi'an. Tianshui officials previously said that kitchen staff bought non-food-grade paints online and used them in some food, but the public did not believe this. Some parents claimed that Tianshui officials tried to silence them and said that medical costs would only be fully covered if children were treated in Tianshui, even though local test results were unreliable.

This is not the first lead poisoning incident in Tianshui, which is an industrial area. In 2006, over 200 people in the Wujiahe Village were found to have lead poisoning, believed to be from two chemical factories. At that time, local tests showed normal lead levels, but tests in Lanzhou, the provincial capital, showed different results.
