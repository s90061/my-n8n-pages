            <h1>AI Outlook and Powell's Hawkish Stance Create Tug-of-War, European Stocks Mixed</h1>
            <p>People are very hopeful about Artificial Intelligence (AI). At the same time, the head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, said that if they cut interest rates too fast, prices might go up even more (inflation). Because of these two different ideas, the main stock markets in Europe had mixed results today.</p>
            <p>The London FTSE 100 index went up by 27.11 points, or 0.29%, ending at 9250.43 points.</p>
            <p>The Frankfurt DAX index went up by 55.48 points, or 0.23%, ending at 23666.81 points.</p>
            <p>The Paris CAC 40 index went down by 44.57 points, or 0.57%, ending at 7827.45 points.</p>

            <h1>Zelensky's UN Speech: Not Stopping Russian Army Could Lead to Destructive Arms Race</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke at the United Nations General Assembly. He asked strong countries to work together to stop Russia's war against Ukraine. He warned that if they do not, there could be a very harmful arms race. He also said that Russia wants to spread the war to other places outside Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelensky said the war between Russia and Ukraine has caused the worst arms race in history. He also said that Ukraine is ready to sell weapons to its friendly countries (allies).</p>
            <p>He said, "The truth is simple: stopping this war now is cheaper than building underground schools or big bunkers for important buildings later."</p>
            <p>Zelensky gave examples of Russian drones and fighter jets that entered the skies of Poland and Estonia, which are NATO countries. He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is testing new limits beyond the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>He said, "Now, Russian drones have flown over Europe, and Russia's actions have spread to many countries. Putin wants to make this war last longer by making it bigger. No one can feel safe now."</p>
            <p>Zelensky also stated that Ukraine has decided to start selling weapons made in Ukraine to its allies.</p>
            <p>He said, "You don't need to start this defense production race from the beginning. We are ready to share what has been proven useful in battle."</p>
            <p>"We are ready to use our modern weapons to help you be safe now. We have decided to sell our weapons. These are strong systems that have been tested in real war when all international groups failed."</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Zelensky also warned today that Europe must not let Russia gain power in Moldova, a country that is very important. He said Europe should not let Moldova become like Belarus and Georgia, which are now controlled by Russia.</p>
            <p>He said, "Russia is trying to do to Moldova what Iran did to Lebanon many years ago. But the world's reaction is still not enough. In Europe, we have already lost Georgia. And for many years, Belarus has been getting closer to Russia. Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova too."</p>
            <p>During his speech today, Zelensky also talked about his meeting with US President Donald Trump yesterday.</p>
            <p>Zelensky said, "President Trump and I had a good meeting. I also talked with many other important leaders. When we work together, we can make a big change."</p>
            <p>"Of course, we are trying our best to get real help from Europe, and we also rely on America's support."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said that Ukraine can get back all its lost land with help from the European Union (EU) and NATO. This new statement shows a clear change from what Trump said before. For several months, he often said it was not very likely for Ukraine to take back large parts of land held by Russia.</p>

            <h1>US Seizes Bicycles Due to Forced Labor Allegations; Giant Can Choose to Destroy or Provide Proof</h1>
            <p>Today, US Customs said they have stopped bicycles, parts, and accessories made by Giant company. This is because there is information that Giant may have used forced labor. This includes taking advantage of people who are in a weak position, not paying them enough, and making them work too many extra hours. Giant company can choose to destroy these goods or show proof that they can be brought into the US.</p>
            <p>This morning, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a press release that Giant company broke a US law. This law (Title 19, Section 1307) stops products made with forced labor from coming into the US. So, CBP will immediately hold bicycles, parts, and accessories made by Giant in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>When CBP looked into Giant company, they found signs of forced labor. The International Labor Organization (ILO) lists these signs. They include: taking advantage of people in weak situations, bad working and living conditions, being forced to work to pay off debt, not getting paid enough, and working too many extra hours.</p>
            <p>CBP said that Giant company made money by doing these things. This made products cheaper than they should be. This led to millions of dollars in unfair profits and hurt American businesses. The International Labor Organization (ILO) believes that almost 28 million workers around the world are forced to work.</p>
            <p>Susan S. Thomas, an official from CBP's Office of Trade, said that "companies that import goods must check carefully and know where their products come from." CBP will keep looking into claims of forced labor. If they find it in the supply chains that bring goods to the US, they will act.</p>
            <p>The order to hold Giant company's goods is the newest step CBP has taken to deal with forced labor. When CBP has proof that imported goods are made by forced labor, they will issue an order to stop those goods. Companies that have their goods stopped can choose to destroy the goods, send them back to another country, or prove that the goods can legally enter the US.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said it will work with the Ministry of Labor. They will help Giant company quickly fix any forced labor issues it might have. This will help CBP remove the order to stop the goods sooner.</p>
