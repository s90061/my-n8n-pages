            <h1>Germany's Border Checks Cost 80 Million Euros, Most Money Spent on Police Overtime</h1>
            <p>Germany started checking all its borders again in September last year. New information from the Federal Ministry of Interior shows that by the end of June this year, this action has cost about 80.5 million Euros (around 2.8 billion Taiwan Dollars). Most of this money was spent on overtime pay for federal police, which was 37.9 million Euros (about 1.3 billion Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>The report also shows that the extra costs for federal police working at the border are about 24 million to 29.1 million Euros every three months. From April to June 2025 alone, the government spent about 8 million Euros on food and housing for police officers. Nearly 3 million Euros were spent on special pay for working difficult hours. Equipment cost 2.6 million Euros, and running the border checkpoints cost almost 2 million Euros.</p>
            <p>About 14,000 federal police officers are currently working at the borders. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced last week that they will continue the land border checks, which were planned for one year. They will also send people back who are not allowed to stay. This has caused questions and disagreements in Germany.</p>
            <p>Marcel Emmerich, a spokesperson for internal affairs in the Green Party in parliament, said that tens of thousands of federal police have been sent to the border for these actions, which he called "illegal and useless." He added that this has caused a shortage of police at train stations and airports. It also makes things harder for people who travel to work or for holidays.</p>
            <p>The Police Union (GdP) said that checking all borders has made the police's workload "very high." Andreas RoÃŸkopf, the union head, said that as border and immigration rules become stricter, police units across the country are still changing their work schedules. Because there are not enough police, many officers have to give up their planned training and further education.</p>
            <p>Last year, there were several knife attacks and car attacks in Germany. The far-right AfD party criticized the ruling party's policies on refugees and immigrants. This helped the AfD gain many votes and become the largest party in many German states.</p>
            <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz had already made border control and stricter immigration policies part of his promises during the parliamentary election in February this year. After taking office in May, he continued to make border checks stronger. The goal is to stop the AfD party from growing more because of immigration and refugee issues, which could make society more far-right and anti-foreigner.</p>

            <h1>Good Morning World: Resilience Law Budget Increases to 590 Billion, Everyone Gets Cash Without Income Limits</h1>
            <p>The Executive Yuan meeting on August 14th approved changes to the Resilience Special Regulations. The maximum money set aside will increase to 590 billion New Taiwan Dollars. They also decided when to give out cash to everyone and added 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars for administrative costs. Another 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars will be added to make electricity stronger, and an extra 4 billion New Taiwan Dollars will be given to help disadvantaged groups. The plan will now go to the Legislative Yuan for review. The time for giving out cash has changed: it will start within one month after the special budget is announced and finish within seven months. The Executive Yuan said that because lawmakers from different parties have shared public opinions, and because of new customs policies and natural disasters, they decided not to set an income limit for giving out the money. They will also increase help for disadvantaged groups. If all parties agree, it is expected that the money could be given out in September.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan on August 14th also approved an extra budget plan. It includes a total of 87.84136 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This money will come from the leftover funds from this year's original budget. The largest part is 63.60554 billion New Taiwan Dollars for general subsidies to special municipalities and county governments. The next largest is 13.27833 billion New Taiwan Dollars for various government projects that are actually needed. After that, 5.94601 billion New Taiwan Dollars will be used for extra pay for military personnel under the Ministry of National Defense and the Ocean Affairs Council. The plan to pay for not cutting trees in indigenous reserved land, which many people care about, will get 2.36825 billion New Taiwan Dollars. The Central Election Commission will get 1.54324 billion New Taiwan Dollars for holding the 11th legislative recall cases and national referendums this year. Premier Cho Jung-tai said that considering the need for local governments to run their affairs and for central ministries to save money, they have proposed this extra budget and hope the Legislative Yuan will support it.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine is stuck, and the world is watching if the meeting between leaders of the US and Russia, planned for this Friday in Alaska, can bring a breakthrough. The issue of Ukraine's land is still important. A reporter recently visited Slovyansk in eastern Ukraine. People there strongly wish for peace, but they have different ideas about who should own their land and what their future should be. Residents near a hotel said they just hope everything ends tomorrow so they can sleep well. Another person, a doctor there, said she understands that some people still feel a connection to the Soviet Union, but times have changed. She asked, "How can we live with people who are shooting bombs at us?" European leaders, led by German Chancellor Merz, had a video meeting on August 13th to stop the US and Russia from making deals that would hurt Ukraine and Europe. German media described this as a psychological strategy made for Trump's personality.</p>
            <p>Seoul has been hit by heavy rain for two days in a row. Streets are full of muddy water, cars are stuck, and people are busy trying to save their belongings at home. Some areas in Seoul and nearby cities like Paju, Incheon, and Gimpo have had 250 to 300 millimeters of rain. The authorities have issued flood and landslide warnings for areas near rivers, streams, and hills. Emergency workers have rescued at least 145 people, and there have been hundreds of reports of blocked roads. As of August 14th, one person has died, and over 1,000 people have had to leave their homes.</p>
            <p>Two new types of drones from the Armaments Bureau were shown for the first time on a military news program on August 14th: a "bomb-dropping" drone and a "suicide" drone. Both are designed for fighting in a non-traditional way, focusing on being quick to assemble, easy to make in large numbers, cheap, and effective. The suicide drone is a fixed-wing type and can attack from far away. The program also showed that the Armaments Bureau has found a way to use the Hellfire missile, originally used on AH-64E Apache helicopters, as a land-based system on a vehicle for mobile launching. It successfully hit a target at sea in a live fire test. This will make the military stronger and is a new achievement in Taiwan's own defense technology.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Yangliu hit Taitung hard on August 13th. Fonggang experienced strong winds of up to level 15, and Orchid Island and Green Island had winds up to level 17. Trees were broken, and many facilities like roads, electricity, and telecommunications were damaged. Economic crops like sugar apples and pomelos, which were almost ready to be picked, were all destroyed. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, agricultural losses in Taitung are over 300 million New Taiwan Dollars. Several lawmakers have asked the Executive Yuan to include the recovery and rebuilding in the rules for disaster recovery after Typhoon Dianmu. County Commissioner Rao Ching-ling also hopes the central government will help farmers. To deal with Typhoon Dianmu, the Executive Yuan had already approved 2 billion New Taiwan Dollars for home recovery payments. The Ministry of Interior said on August 14th that it has received 39,000 applications and will set aside 1.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars as needed. In Chiayi County, two men illegally entered a restricted area at the mouth of the Bazhang River to fish during the typhoon on August 13th. One of them fell into the sea and is missing. The Coast Guard Administration will fine the person who was with him 50,000 to 250,000 New Taiwan Dollars according to the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act.</p>
            <p>Li Chin-yung, head of the Central Election Commission, said on August 14th that there are no rules against promoting referendums on election day, which is August 23rd. However, since seven recall cases for Kuomintang lawmakers and a referendum on restarting the nuclear power plant in New Taipei's Sanchong will also be held on the same day, he reminded people not to include messages about the recall cases when promoting the referendum, to avoid breaking the law. Kuomintang lawmaker Weng Hsiao-ling questioned whether President Lai Ching-te's public call to "vote 'no' on the referendum" goes against administrative neutrality. Minister of Civil Service Shih Neng-jer replied in the Legislative Yuan's Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee on August 14th that it was the elected president's way of stating policy, which is a type of policy speech, and does not go against administrative neutrality.</p>
            <p>Lawyer Tsai Kun-chou wrote on social media on August 13th that he met a Chinese lawyer named Liu Rong-fang acting as a legal representative in the Taichung District Court. The case was a civil lawsuit between a Taiwanese bicycle company and an Austrian sales platform. Liu argued that "the law does not prohibit it" and said she was the company's legal staff but did not show proof. The Taichung District Court said that without proof, she could not act as a legal representative. The Mainland Affairs Council said that Mr. Liu applied to enter Taiwan with court documents and said he was a company legal advisor, but he did not say he was a lawyer. The Ministry of Justice said that to work as a lawyer in Taiwan, one must have a Taiwanese lawyer's license. The Taichung District Prosecutor's Office has started an investigation into the entire case.</p>
            <p>The number of Dengue fever cases in Guangdong, China, is now over 9,000, and it is spreading to other areas. Recently, Guangxi and Zhejiang were added as "risk level 1" areas for Dengue fever, meaning there is a high risk of outbreaks. Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Anhui were put in "risk level 2," meaning there is some risk of local outbreaks. Tseng Shu-hui, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control, said on August 14th that the travel warning for Guangdong Province will remain at "level 2 alert" for now. They will not change the warnings for other areas but will continue to watch the situation. She reminded people planning to travel to Dengue fever areas to take steps to prevent mosquito bites.</p>
            <p>A-Mei, a famous singer, will perform on September 6th at Lin Chih-sheng's retirement game at the Taipei Dome. The two became friends because of their involvement in the "Care Cup." The Wei Chuan Dragons baseball team announced that their player Lin Chih-sheng will have his retirement games from September 5th to 7th at the Taipei Dome. They also announced that on September 5th, singer Jam Hsiao will perform, and then on September 6th, A-Mei will sing after the game. She has helped the Care Cup for many years and supports the development of indigenous baseball with Lin Chih-sheng. Lin Chih-sheng said it is an honor to have her perform at his final games. A-Mei said, "Being able to sing at his retirement games is my deepest blessing."</p>

            <h1>Trump and Putin: Strong and Good at Talking, Ukraine's Peace Future Is Not Decided</h1>
            <p>The leaders of the US and Russia will have a meeting in Alaska to talk about peace in Ukraine. News in the US says that the issue of Ukraine's land is the main topic. Putin feels confident because Russian troops are making progress, so he can suggest ideas to Trump. Trump wants to be a peacemaker. But people are worried if the two will make secret deals when they are alone.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet on August 15th in Anchorage, Alaska, which is only 90 kilometers from Russian land. This meeting is very important for history.</p>
            <p>In 1867, the US and Russia signed a treaty in Washington. Russia agreed to sell Alaska to the US for 7.2 million US dollars. Putin, as president, will be on American land that was once Russian more than 150 years ago. They will talk about ending the war in Ukraine, but the leader of the country that was attacked is not at the meeting.</p>
            <p>The world is waiting to see if the meeting will have any results. If there are results, how will Ukraine and Europe deal with their future? Trump plans to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after his talks with Putin.</p>
            <p>Russia attacked Ukraine in the spring of 2022. Ukrainian troops fought hard with military help from the US and Europe. The Russian army could not win quickly as they planned, and their economy and finances were badly affected. But as the war continued, help from the US and Europe slowed down. Russia continued to sell energy to India, China, and some European countries, which helped their economy become stable. Russia also recruited more soldiers, and the Ukrainian army is now in a difficult position.</p>
            <p>Russian troops have taken almost all of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. They now control most of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, and have connected these areas south to Crimea, which Russia took in 2014. From this, it is clear what Vladimir Putin wants to achieve.</p>
            <p>Putin wants to connect Russian land from inland to the Black Sea, taking the port in the Kherson region. This would leave Ukraine with a very short coastline, which would greatly reduce its economic development and strategic importance.</p>
            <p>The New York Times said that Putin feels strong because the Russian army is doing better on the battlefield. In the beginning, Russian troops did not have enough equipment and were confused, so the Ukrainian army hit them hard. But Putin used all of Russia's power to change the army and the country's economy. He recruited soldiers, bought weapons, and changed tactics at the front lines, with the only goal of defeating the Ukrainian army.</p>
            <p>Now, the war is going well for Russia. The Russian army has more soldiers and equipment than the Ukrainian army and all the help from Western countries combined. Russian soldiers continue to be injured or die, but they are still moving west. The front line is now 1,200 kilometers long, which allows Putin to fight until he gets a peace agreement based on what he wants.</p>
            <p>Trump wants to be a "peacemaker" and win a Nobel Peace Prize for his time as president. However, the White House has surprisingly lowered expectations for the meeting. Trump said he believes he can reach an agreement with Putin, but there is still a 25% chance it will fail.</p>
            <p>Putin's goal is very clear: he wants other countries to accept and agree that Russia has taken Ukrainian land. Being on the international stage helps him get more attention. People are worried that Trump will be alone with Putin, who is also good at negotiating, and that no one will know if they make secret deals.</p>
