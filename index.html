            <h1>China's Government Meeting: Boost Local Economy and Remove Limits on Spending</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 16) Today, Chinese Premier Li Qiang led a regular meeting of the State Council. They talked about how to make the "domestic economic cycle" stronger. The meeting said they want to start special actions to boost spending. They will "systematically remove unfair rules that stop people from spending money." They also want to quickly fix problems that slow down the domestic economic cycle.</p>
            <p>Because of the trade war between the US and China, China's foreign trade has faced difficulties. So, making the "domestic economic cycle" stronger has become a key way for the Chinese government to deal with problems and keep the economy working well. In May, the Chinese State Council held a special meeting to talk about "making the domestic economic cycle stronger." At that time, Li Qiang said they must truly understand the current economic situation. He said they should focus on "making the domestic economic cycle stronger" to help China's economy grow steadily for a long time.</p>
            <p>CCTV News reported that today's State Council meeting decided that making the "domestic economic cycle" stronger is an important plan to help the economy grow steadily. They need to find the main points to focus on. They will deeply put into action special plans to increase spending. They will also "systematically remove unfair limits that stop people from spending money."</p>
            <p>The meeting said they want to improve the "trade-in policy for consumer goods." They also want to give people more choices for goods, as people want to buy more things. They will invest more in "new quality productive forces" and new service industries. This will help release the full potential of local demand. It will also continuously make the domestic economic cycle stronger from the inside.</p>
            <p>The meeting also said they need to focus on big problems. They want to make policies clearer and easier to use. They will also make different government departments work together better. This will help policies be put into action more effectively. It will also quickly fix problems that stop the domestic economic cycle from working smoothly.</p>
            <p>The meeting asked relevant departments to improve how they design policies. They should listen carefully to ideas from all sides. They should also actively help local areas and businesses with their problems and help them grow. Everyone should work together to make the economy better.</p>
            <p>Besides talking about the "domestic economic cycle," the meeting also heard a report on how to manage competition in the new energy car industry. The meeting asked that for the unreasonable competition in the new energy car industry, they should use "both short-term and long-term solutions." They must truly set rules for competition in the new energy car industry.</p>
            <p>The meeting mentioned that they need to study costs and watch prices more closely. They will also check more often that products are made consistently. They will also make sure that big car companies keep their promises about payment times. They want to build a long-lasting system for fair competition. They will encourage businesses in the industry to set their own good standards. They also want to use standards to help the industry grow better. This will guide companies to become more competitive by using new technology and making better products.</p>

            <h1>South Korean Teacher and Parent Caught Stealing Exam Papers at Night; Student Expelled</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Seoul, July 16) South Korean police said today that a high school student's teacher and mother were caught trying to steal exam papers from a school late at night. The female student was also removed from school because of this.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that in South Korea, people care a lot about students' grades at school. The government even stops planes from taking off or landing during the English listening part of the university entrance exam.</p>
            <p>Reports say that the teacher and parent broke into a high school in Andong City, about 270 kilometers south of Seoul, around 1 AM on July 4th. They tried to steal exam papers. A security alarm went off, and they were caught.</p>
            <p>A detective from the Andong City Police Department said, "The 31-year-old teacher and 48-year-old mother have both said they did it."</p>
            <p>The police also stated that this teacher worked at the school until February last year. During that time, she also gave private lessons to the female student.</p>
            <p>Police suspect that these two people might have stolen things in a similar way before. They think the teacher and parent did this to help the female student get good grades. The police also think that money was exchanged between them.</p>
            <p>The police pointed out, "They tried to steal not only the Korean exam papers that the teacher taught but also exam papers for other subjects."</p>
            <p>Also, a school maintenance worker was arrested because he helped the suspects get into the school.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News reported that the female student had very good grades since she started school in 2023. After this happened, the school removed her, and her grades will not count.</p>

            <h1>Japan's Akutagawa and Naoki Prizes Not Given This Year, First Time in 27 Years</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Tokyo, July 16) The 173rd Akutagawa Prize and Naoki Prize meetings were held today by the Japan Literature Promotion Society. They took place at the "Shinkiraku" restaurant in Tsukiji, Tokyo. The result was that both prizes announced "no winner." This is the first time in 27 years that both prizes have no winner, since the 118th prizes in 1998. It is also only the sixth time in history that both prizes have not been given out at the same time.</p>
            <p>The Akutagawa Prize is a famous award for serious literature. Its goal is to encourage new writers. The Naoki Prize is a well-known award for popular literature. It is usually given to writers who have already published popular books. Both the Akutagawa Prize and the Naoki Prize are given twice a year. Each prize gives 1 million Japanese Yen.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that there were four books nominated for the 173rd Akutagawa Prize. One was by Gregory Khezrnejat, who is 41 years old and from America but writes in Japanese. His book "Trajectory" was nominated for the second time. Shunya Komada, 30 years old, was nominated for the first time with "If It's a Bird's Dream (tentative title)." Kei Mukaisaka, 31 years old, was nominated for the second time with "Dance, Towards a Place More Painful Than Love (tentative title)." And Kareiko Hibino, 21 years old, was nominated for the first time with "Endless Addition of Light (tentative title)."</p>
            <p>There were six books nominated for the Naoki Prize. These included "Tired of Dancing (tentative title)" by Takeshi Shioda, who used to be a news reporter. Also, Yuko Yuzuki, the writer of "The Blood of Lone Wolves," was nominated for "The Fugitive Goes North (tentative title)." However, none of the total 10 books were chosen by the judges.</p>
            <p>The last time the Naoki Prize had no winner was in 2007, for the 136th prize. That was 18 years ago. The last time the Akutagawa Prize had no winner was in 2011, for the 145th prize, 14 years ago. The last time both prizes had no winners at the same time was in 1998, for the 118th prizes.</p>
            <p>Natsuhiko Kyogoku, a writer and a judge for the Naoki Prize, said, "This time, judging was very hard. Usually, it only takes 1 to 2 hours, or at most 3 hours. But this time it took 4 hours, which is very unusual. Because all the books were very good, all the judges finally agreed that they could not choose just one book. It's truly a shame."</p>
            <p>Hiromi Kawakami, a judge for the Akutagawa Prize, said, "Some people say that the Akutagawa Prize should try new things and new ways of looking at things. Each book did have some new ideas and attempts. But overall, it felt like they should have pushed the boundaries more. It's very sad that we couldn't choose a winning book."</p>
