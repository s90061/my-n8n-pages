            <h1>李渝「溫州街的故事」 看見台北人風貌與風骨</h1>
            <p>The first collection of short stories by the late writer Li Yu, "The Story of Wenzhou Street," is now available again. It shows the style and spirit of people in Taipei after 1949.</p>
            <p>A special event was held on September 6th at the Tai Jing-nong Cultural Center in Taipei. United Literature Publishing House organized it. Writer Yang Jia-xian gave the main speech. Mei Jia-ling and Tang Juan also spoke. They talked about parts of Li Yu's "The Story of Wenzhou Street" and her only long novel, "The Story of the Golden Monkey."</p>
            <p>Yang Jia-xian said that Li Yu's stories seem calm on the outside, but inside they are full of tension and sadness from history. Li Yu liked to write about wars. This included real battles, and also "love as a battlefield," "playing mahjong," and "inner struggles." These ideas might make people think of Eileen Chang's works.</p>
            <p>Yang Jia-xian added that Li Yu did not like Eileen Chang. Li Yu thought Chang's characters always went downhill, and their times, lives, and spirits were very dark. Yang Jia-xian believes that even when Li Yu's stories are dark, the characters do not keep falling. They always find something strong inside to lift their spirits.</p>
            <p>Mei Jia-ling, a special professor at National Taiwan University, said that she often uses Li Yu's works in her classes. Many students learn a lot from them. Mei Jia-ling also mentioned the friendship between Li Yu's father and Tai Jing-nong. This friendship is seen in Li Yu's stories, which talk about the pain and fear cultural figures felt after 1949. Her works also helped the next generation understand their own land.</p>
            <p>Poet Tang Juan spoke about Li Yu's deep interest in culture. He also talked about her "three-distance" style of writing: deep, high, and calm. This showed her unique, simple, and poetic way of writing.</p>
            <p>Li Yu was born in Chongqing in 1944. In 1949, she moved to Taiwan with her family. She studied Foreign Languages at National Taiwan University. She earned a Ph.D. in Chinese Art History from the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States. While in the U.S., she and her husband, writer Kuo Sung-fen, took part in the Diaoyu Islands Movement. In 1983, she won the China Times Literary Award. She then started writing again and published her "Wenzhou Street Story" series.</p>
            <p>The introduction to "The Story of Wenzhou Street" says that the book shows Li Yu's deep care for recent history. It tells about the sadness of war and displacement. It also talks about people hurt by politics during the White Terror and the Cultural Revolution. It shares the stories of intellectuals who faced difficulties and moved from place to place. They looked for personal and shared memories in lost times and places.</p>

            <h1>雪梨發生大白鯊攻擊致死事件 無人機海灘上空尋蹤</h1>
            <p>Government officials in Australia said that after a shark attacked and killed a surfer in Sydney yesterday, drones and helicopters are now looking for a great white shark. They are watching the waters around two well-known Sydney beaches today.</p>
            <p>The attack happened yesterday in northern Sydney, the main city of New South Wales. It was about 100 meters from Long Reef Beach. The man was surfing with his friends at that time.</p>
            <p>Police said that other people saved the experienced surfer from the water. But he lost too much blood and died at the scene.</p>
            <p>Sydney is the biggest city in Australia. After this shark attack, two beaches in the city are still closed today.</p>
            <p>The last time a shark attack killed someone at a Sydney beach was in February 2022. The first time was in 1963.</p>
            <p>The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) in New South Wales said that Surf Life Saving NSW, a main water rescue group in the state, sent drones and helicopters today. They are checking the area to find the shark.</p>
            <p>A statement from the DPIRD said that more "smart drumlines" have been put in place. These drumlines use satellite technology. They send a message to officials right away if a shark bites the bait.</p>
            <p>The DPIRD is in charge of looking into this case. They said that government shark experts looked at photos of the victim's surfboard. They believe the great white shark that caused the attack was about 3.4 to 3.6 meters long.</p>
            <p>According to official information from Taronga Zoo in Sydney, yesterday's event was the fourth deadly shark attack in Australia this year. In March, a surfer died after a shark attack in shallow water at a faraway beach in Western Australia.</p>
            <p>The International Shark Attack File from the University of Florida states that Australia had the second-highest number of unprovoked shark attacks in 2024, after the United States.</p>

            <h1>OPEC+將召開產量會議 增產與否受矚目</h1>
            <p>Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other important countries in OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies) will decide on crude oil production in a meeting today. Experts say that the meeting's result is still unclear. They also say that increasing production is possible.</p>
            <p>This meeting of the "Voluntary Eight," which are eight large oil-producing countries, is happening while oil prices are falling. This is because people expect there will be too much oil supply in the next few months.</p>
            <p>To keep oil prices from falling too much, OPEC+ has agreed to cut production many times in recent years. They have cut almost 6 million barrels per day in total.</p>
            <p>Since April, the V8 countries (Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman) have changed their plan. They now want to get back their share of the market. They have agreed to many steps to increase production.</p>
            <p>One week ago, most experts thought that the V8 members would keep their current production levels in October.</p>
            <p>Other oil-producing countries around the world, not in OPEC+, are producing more oil. Also, taxes are lowering demand. Because of these reasons, oil prices are now low, between $65 and $70 per barrel. Prices have fallen by 12% this year.</p>
