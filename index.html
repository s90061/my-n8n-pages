            <h1>Trump and Xi Jinping to Meet in Korea; Trump Might Add 100% Tariffs Sooner</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump said he plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in a few weeks. This comes as the US and China are having problems with rare earth metals. Trump also said that tariffs (extra taxes on goods) help the US. He added that he can put the 100% new tariffs on Chinese goods into effect earlier if he wants.</p>
            <p>Last week, China said it would limit how much rare earth metals it sells to other countries. If these limits happen, they could hurt US industries like defense, technology, computer chips, and cars. Trump said he would put 100% extra taxes on Chinese goods in return. But later, he seemed to want to calm things down. Both the US and China have privately said they want to stop their trade problems, at least for a while.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked about the US-China trade talks, Trump said this afternoon at the White House that his meeting with Xi Jinping seems to be happening as planned. He also said again that his relationship with Xi Jinping is "very good." China wants to talk, and because of the tariffs, the US is in a very strong position now.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that he could make the 100% tariffs on Chinese goods start earlier than November 1st if he wanted to. But China does not want that to happen. He said, "They want to talk, we are talking, and I think we will reach an agreement that is good for both sides."</p>
            <p>Scott Bessent, the US Secretary of the Treasury, was also there. He said that the leaders of the US and China respect each other a lot. He will talk to Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng tonight. They plan to meet in Malaysia around next week to get ready for the meeting between Trump and Xi.</p>
            <p>Bessent said he hopes China will show the same respect to the US. He also said that the situation has "calmed down."</p>
            <p>Korean news reported on October 16th, citing Korean officials, that Trump is expected to arrive in South Korea on October 29th and stay until October 30th.</p>
            <p>The APEC leaders' meeting this year will be from October 31st to November 1st, and Xi Jinping is expected to be there. People think the meeting between Trump and Xi will most likely happen on October 30th.</p>

            <h1>Afghanistan Says Pakistan Broke Ceasefire, Air Strikes Kill 10 People</h1>
            <p>Today, officials in Afghanistan told AFP that Pakistan attacked Afghanistan with air strikes tonight. These attacks killed at least 10 people and broke a ceasefire (a stop to fighting) at the border that had only lasted for two days.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that this ceasefire had stopped about a week of fighting and killing at the border. Many soldiers and civilians from both sides had died in those earlier fights. But the ceasefire only lasted for 48 hours.</p>
            <p>A high-ranking Taliban official, who wanted to remain unnamed, told AFP: "Pakistan bombed three places in Paktika province. This broke the ceasefire. Afghanistan will fight back."</p>
            <p>A local hospital official, who also did not want to be named, told AFP that the air strikes by Pakistan killed 10 ordinary people. Two children were among the dead. Also, 12 people were hurt.</p>
            <p>The ceasefire began at 1:00 PM GMT on October 15th. Pakistan said the ceasefire would last for 48 hours. But Afghanistan said the ceasefire was supposed to last until Pakistan broke it.</p>
            <p>Pakistan's Minister of Defense, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, said that Afghanistan was "acting for India" and "planning against Pakistan."</p>
            <p>Asif wrote on X (formerly Twitter): "From now on, we will not try to make peace through talks, and we will not send people to Kabul." Soon after he said this, news of new air strikes came out.</p>
            <p>He strongly said: "Wherever terrorism comes from, there will be a high price to pay."</p>
            <p>Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesperson for the Taliban government, said that their soldiers have orders not to start fighting unless Pakistan shoots first.</p>
            <p>In an interview with Ariana TV in Afghanistan, he repeated the message given to the soldiers: "If they shoot, then you have every right to protect your country."</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Putin May Be Waiting for Time; Giving Tomahawk Missiles to Ukraine Is Too Soon</h1>
            <p>Today in Washington, US President Trump said that Russian President Putin agreed to have another big meeting. Trump thinks Putin might be doing this to gain more time. But Trump still believes that Putin wants the war in Ukraine to end. Trump also said it is too early to give Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine right now.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House today. When reporters asked if he was worried that Putin was just trying to delay things, Trump said, "Yes, I am worried."</p>
            <p>He then said, "I have been tricked by the smartest people in my life, but I always get out of it. So, even if he wants to wait a little longer, it's okay. But I think I am very good at this. I believe he really wants to make a deal."</p>
            <p>Trump said it is still too early to give Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. He hopes to achieve peace with Russia first.</p>
            <p>He told reporters, "I hope they don't need those missiles. I hope we can end this war without having to think about Tomahawk missiles."</p>
            <p>Trump also said he is confident he can make Putin end the invasion that started in 2022. He mentioned that he had spoken to the Kremlin leader by phone just the day before.</p>
            <p>The presidents of the US and Russia agreed to have a big meeting in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. This will be their first talk after their meeting in Alaska in August did not lead to any peace agreement.</p>
            <p>However, Zelenskyy, who was visiting, was not so sure. He said that Putin is "not ready" for peace. This was Zelenskyy's third visit to Washington since Trump returned to the White House.</p>
            <p>For the past few weeks, Ukraine has been asking Washington for Tomahawk cruise missiles. They believe these long-range missiles can put pressure on Russia to end the war.</p>
            <p>But just before Zelenskyy's visit, Putin warned Trump in a phone call not to give these weapons. He said this could make the fighting worse and put peace talks in danger.</p>
            <p>Right now, Russia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine's land. Most of this land has been destroyed by the war.</p>
            <p>Today, Russia's Ministry of Defense said that they have taken control of three villages in the Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkov areas of Ukraine.</p>
