Many people are noticing that their favourite products, like chocolate bars, crisps, or even toilet paper, are getting smaller. But the price often stays the same, or even goes up a little. This trend is called 'shrinkflation'.

Companies say they are doing this because the costs for ingredients and making goods are rising. This is part of a bigger problem called inflation, where prices for everything are increasing. Instead of raising prices a lot, companies make products smaller to save money.

Shoppers are often annoyed because they feel they are getting less for their money. They might not notice the change immediately, as packaging often looks the same. Experts say that shrinkflation is likely to continue as long as companies face high production costs. It means people are paying the same, or more, for less product in their daily lives.

**Workplace Change: More Companies Ask Employees Back to the Office**

After a few years of working from home for many, companies are now asking their employees to come back to the office more often. This is a big change from the flexible working rules put in place during the pandemic.

Many large companies are becoming stricter about how much time staff must spend in the office each week. They say that being together in the office helps people work better as a team and improves the company's culture. They believe it's easier to share ideas and train new staff when everyone is in the same place.

However, many employees prefer to work from home, at least part-time. They enjoy the flexibility and saving time on commuting. This new push for office returns means some workers might have less freedom than before. It shows a clear shift in how companies see the future of work.

**New Rules for Travelers: Europe Fights Overtourism**

Many popular places in Europe are now putting new rules in place to manage the large number of tourists. This problem is called 'overtourism', and it means that too many visitors can cause difficulties for local people and damage natural areas.

Cities like Venice in Italy have started charging entry fees for day-trippers. Other places are limiting how many people can visit certain areas each day, or making rules for large tour groups. These steps are being taken to protect the beauty of these places and ensure a good quality of life for residents.

The goal is to encourage more sustainable tourism. This means finding a balance so that visitors can still enjoy these wonderful places, but without harming them. These new rules show that European destinations are serious about managing tourism for the long term. Travelers should check for specific rules before they visit.
