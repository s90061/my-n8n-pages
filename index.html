            <h1>New York State Approves New Underground Power Line, Micron's Huge Chip Factory Project Continues</h1>
            <p>New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the New York State Public Service Commission has approved a new underground power line. This power line will connect the Clay substation to a very large chip factory that Micron Technology plans to build in Onondaga County.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this underground power line is more than 3 kilometers long. It is an important part of Micron Technology's 100 billion US dollar investment in central New York State. This investment is for making computer chips.</p>
            <p>Governor Hochul stated in a press release on October 16 that this is the biggest private investment in New York State's history.</p>
            <p>This investment plan is expected to create over 50,000 jobs in the next 20 years. This includes 9,000 direct jobs within Micron itself.</p>
            <p>Hochul said, "This project will greatly change central New York State. We are moving forward very quickly and carefully."</p>
            <p>Micron and New York State agreed in 2022 to build an advanced manufacturing base in the state. This large chip factory aims to produce about a quarter of all computer chips in the United States by 2030.</p>

            <h1>KMT Chairman Election: Pingtung Vote Irregularity, Su Ching-chuan Says 5-Person Team Investigating</h1>
            <p>Today, during the Kuomintang (KMT) chairman election, something happened in Gaoshu Township, Pingtung County. A polling observer named Mr. Ke, from candidate Hau Lung-pin's team, took other people's ballots without permission. Su Ching-chuan, the chairman of the Pingtung County KMT branch, said a team of 5 people is looking into this. The results will be sent to the KMT headquarters, and they will follow party rules.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County KMT branch said in a press release today that election staff in Gaoshu Township checked the votes. They found that Mr. Ke, the polling observer, seemed to have taken other people's ballots. After checking at the scene, Mr. Ke admitted his wrong actions. After this happened, they stopped using that ballot, and they told the county party branch to record it and check it later.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County KMT branch also mentioned that Mr. Ke wrote a statement by himself. He said that a supporter of a candidate wanted to make things easy and did not follow the rules carefully. He did not think about the fairness and image of the election. He felt very sorry for what he did.</p>
            <p>Su Ching-chuan told the Central News Agency that the 5-person team is investigating. The full results will definitely be sent to the party headquarters. They will follow the party rules to make sure the election is fair and proper.</p>
