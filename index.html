            <h1>Asia Optical: Sales Expected to Grow in Second Half, Philippines Expansion to Address Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Asia Optical, a company that makes optical parts, held a meeting today. The chairman, Lai Yi-ren, said that the company's sales might continue to grow in the second half of the year. To deal with the effects of extra taxes on goods, Asia Optical has started to make more products in the Philippines. Some products might be moved there for production. The company is also renting a new factory in Thailand.</p>
            <p>Lai Yi-ren explained that car lenses are not sent directly to the United States, so they are not affected by these taxes. For digital cameras made in Myanmar, half are sold to the United States. Currently, the tax on goods from Myanmar is 40%. The government of Myanmar is talking with the U.S. government, and the tax might still go down.</p>
            <p>In the first half of this year, the New Taiwan Dollar became stronger against the U.S. Dollar by about 11%. Even so, Asia Optical made money from currency exchange. Lai Yi-ren said that Asia Optical uses different currencies like Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, and U.S. Dollars. This helped them make money. When the New Taiwan Dollar became stronger, it brought profits from their U.S. Dollar debts and also from their Japanese Yen debts.</p>
            <p>In the second quarter of this year, Asia Optical's sales were about 6.908 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This was a 28% increase from the last quarter and a 23% increase from last year. The company's operating profit was about 675 million New Taiwan Dollars, a big jump from the last quarter and last year. They also had extra income from interest, about 89 million New Taiwan Dollars, and currency exchange profits of about 324 million New Taiwan Dollars. This led to a net profit after tax of 799 million New Taiwan Dollars, which was a significant increase. Each share earned 2.86 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Looking at Asia Optical's products, optical parts like those for drones, lenses, and prisms make up 41% of their business. Digital cameras are 19%, image sensors (CIS) are 17%, car lenses are 9.1%, and aiming scopes are 6%.</p>
            <p>Lai Yi-ren pointed out that the profit in the second quarter of this year was the highest in recent years. Digital cameras and action cameras showed the most growth. By July this year, 1.6 million digital cameras were shipped, which is more than the 1.36 million shipped in all of last year. Based on what customers need now, digital camera shipments will continue to grow in the second half of the year. Action camera sales are expected to double this year.</p>
            <p>He added that sales of car lenses are expected to stay the same as the first half of the year because the car market is changing. Drone sales are still low, about 3% of total sales, but they are expected to keep growing this year and next year. Asia Optical is also working with several humanoid robot companies, and they are currently doing small tests.</p>

            <h1>Japanese Artist Takahito Kimura's Giant Blue Kite Flies in Dongju Sky</h1>
            <p>A Japanese artist named Takahito Kimura created a work called "The Day We Become Clouds with Two Islands." He worked with people from two small islands, Dongju in Taiwan and Ogijima in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. He used a special blue printing method to make a huge kite. Today, this giant kite flew successfully in the sky above Dongju Island.</p>
            <p>The 3rd Matsu International Art Island event will start in September. News information says that Takahito Kimura's art piece, "The Day We Become Clouds with Two Islands," had workshops in June on Dongju in Taiwan and in July on Ogijima in Japan. During these workshops, local people collected everyday items and wrote down their wishes and hopes. Then, they used the blue printing method to create a giant fabric kite.</p>
            <p>Takahito Kimura spoke on the phone today and said that with help from people on Dongju Island, the very large kite, which is 8 meters wide and 20 meters long, flew well in the sky over Dongju Island. The actual kite will be shown in the waiting room at Mengao Port in Dongju. Videos and photos of the kite flying will also be shown on Ogijima during the "Setouchi Triennale 2025" in Japan.</p>
            <p>Dongju Elementary School, which helped Kimura fly the kite, sent a message. To make sure the kite flew well, staff members went with Kimura yesterday to a temple to pray for good weather and wind. The Jugang Township Office and Mayor Chen Le-li also helped clean the beach yesterday.</p>
            <p>Dongju Elementary School said that this morning, teachers, students, and island residents helped. They planned to fly the kite at Fuzheng Beach, but the wind was too weak, so the kite could not fly. They did not give up. In the afternoon, they moved to Mengao Port and tried again. Finally, in the evening, the kite successfully flew in the sky over Dongju.</p>
            <p>Talking about why he created the art, Takahito Kimura said that even though Dongju and Ogijima are in different countries and have different languages and cultures, the people on the islands think very similarly. Especially, what adults hope for their children and how they think about the future are surprisingly alike. He hopes his art will help people see the similarities between the two islands. He also hopes it makes them think about what it means to be human and what kind of world we should leave for the next generation.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs: Graphics Cards and Servers Make Up Over 70% of Exports to US, Under Special US Trade Law</h1>
            <p>A temporary 20% tax on goods from Taiwan to the United States is expected to start on August 7th. However, a special investigation by the U.S. government, called the Section 232 investigation, has not finished yet. The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that Taiwan's main products sent to the United States are information and communication technology (ICT) items, such as graphics cards and computer servers. These products make up more than 70% of Taiwan's exports to the U.S. and are part of the Section 232 investigation.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's government has said that Taiwan's own balancing taxes and the Section 232 issue will be discussed together. If Taiwan can get a lower tax rate, it will be better for Taiwan's businesses.</p>
            <p>The Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, He Jincang, said today that once the rates for Taiwan's balancing taxes are decided, the government will quickly release a report about how it will affect businesses. They have already looked at how different tax rates would work and have thought about the impact of a 20% tax. However, since the results of the Section 232 investigation are not out yet, the overall report on how businesses will be affected will be announced by the government.</p>
            <p>He Jincang said that the main products Taiwan exports to the United States are ICT items, graphics cards, and servers. These make up over 70% of exports to the U.S. and are included in the Section 232 investigation. Other exports are from traditional industries, like machinery, cars, and hand tools. The government has said that Taiwan's balancing taxes and the Section 232 issue will be talked about together.</p>
            <p>He Jincang also noted that businesses are more worried about currency exchange rates. But recently, the exchange rate of the New Taiwan Dollar has been stable. If Taiwan can get a lower tax rate, it will give Taiwan's businesses a better chance.</p>
            <p>When asked if the Section 232 tax rate would be the same for all countries, He Jincang explained that he does not know if the U.S. will set different rates for different countries. He also does not know the results of the Section 232 investigation yet. He mentioned that older and newer types of semiconductor chips might have different tax rates, but higher taxes will definitely cost companies more money.</p>
            <p>When talking about how to guess the impact of these taxes on businesses, He Jincang said they are looking at traditional industries that send a lot of products to the U.S. They want to understand how their products are different from those of other countries that compete with them. In the future, government support plans will help these companies become stronger and find new markets, for example, in Southeast Asia or Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
            <p>During the U.S. Section 232 investigation, 20 types of ICT products, like semiconductors, graphics cards, and servers, are not taxed. But products like printed circuit boards (PCBs) and network communication parts have a 10% tax. Looking at trade numbers, in 2024, Taiwan sent 111.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods to the U.S., which was 23% of all its exports. Electronic information products made up 71% of these exports, and other traditional industries made up about 29%. Products that could get Taiwan's balancing taxes made up 20% of exports to the U.S., while products under the Section 232 investigation made up 78%.</p>
