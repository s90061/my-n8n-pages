            <h1>Taichung City Fire Bureau Starts Investigation After Section Chief Accused of Misusing Official Car</h1>
            <p>A section chief in the Taichung City Fire Bureau is accused of using an official car improperly. It is said that they used the car as their private car for a long time. Also, they once asked a colleague to drive them home in the official car after drinking alcohol. The Fire Bureau checked first and said the car was used for work. A colleague drove the section chief home on the way. The Fire Bureau has now started an official internal investigation.</p>
            <p>On the internet, some people shared information saying that a section chief in the Taichung City Fire Bureau often used a work car as their own car. They also said that the section chief asked a co-worker to drive them home in the work car after drinking.</p>
            <p>Yang Yuan-ji, the Deputy Director of the Taichung City Fire Bureau, spoke to reporters today. He said they have received 9 videos. The first check shows that the official car was used for work. Besides checking on duties, the section chief also went to a volunteer fire brigade event. The section chief drank alcohol at the event. They did not drive, but other people who were with them drove them home.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yang said the official car was requested and used for work as required. Because the section chief lives in the coastal area, a colleague who was with them drove them home on the way. The Fire Bureau has now started an internal investigation. If they find any rules were broken, they will follow the regulations.</p>

            <h1>Teng Kai-wei's Pitching Revenge: Throws 152 km/h and Strikes Out 4 Padres Batters</h1>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei, a baseball pitcher from Taiwan who plays for the San Francisco Giants in America, gave up many points in his last game against the Padres. Today, he played again to make up for it. He pitched for 3.1 innings, got 4 strikeouts, and his fastest pitch was 152 kilometers per hour (about 95 miles per hour).</p>
            <p>This was Teng Kai-wei's third game this season. He played against the Padres in their home city, San Diego. The Giants batted first. The first batter, Korean star Lee Jung-hoo, hit a home run in the first inning. So, Teng Kai-wei started pitching when his team was leading 1-0.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the first inning, the Padres' first batter, Fernando Tatis Jr., got on base because the shortstop made a mistake when Teng Kai-wei was pitching. Then, the second batter, Luis Arraez, hit a double. Tatis Jr. scored a run when his teammate hit a ground ball, making the score 1-1.</p>
            <p>After giving up a point, Teng Kai-wei became steady. He ended the first inning with two strikeouts. Then, in the second inning, he got two more strikeouts. He also got through the third inning without giving up any points.</p>
            <p>With the score still 1-1, Teng Kai-wei faced a difficult situation in the fourth inning. The first batter, Ryan O'Hearn, hit a single. After that, Teng Kai-wei hit two batters with his pitches, which meant all bases were full. This was a dangerous situation.</p>
            <p>With all bases full, Jose Iglesias of the Padres hit a single, bringing in one run. This broke the tie, and the Padres took a 2-1 lead. At this point, the coach came out to change pitchers. Teng Kai-wei left the game after one player was out in the fourth inning.</p>
            <p>Today, Teng Kai-wei pitched for 3.1 innings. He had 4 strikeouts, gave up 3 hits, and 2 earned runs. He also walked one batter and hit two batters with pitches. In his previous game on August 13th, also against the Padres, Teng Kai-wei pitched for 1.2 innings and gave up 6 earned runs. This game clearly showed he had improved.</p>
            <p>In the end, the Giants lost the game 1-5. Even though Teng Kai-wei could not help his team win, he showed his good ability to strike out batters in this game. His fastest pitch was 95 miles per hour (152 kilometers per hour). He used different types of pitches like four-seam fastballs, sinkers, sliders, curveballs, and sweepers to confuse the batters. This caused the other team to miss the ball 6 times, and all 4 of his strikeouts were from batters missing the ball.</p>

            <h1>STARLUX Airlines' Second Quarter Profit Drops Sharply, Chairman Says Demand Expected to Return in Q4</h1>
            <p>STARLUX Airlines' profit in the second quarter dropped a lot. The airline only made 8 million New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) in that quarter. Chairman Chang Kuo-wei said that in the second quarter, the airline faced problems from both inside and outside. They prepared staff for more planes too early. Also, taxes caused problems for passenger flights. STARLUX Airlines does not have cargo planes to help make money. The third quarter, which is usually a busy time, was not good. So, this year has many changes, and running the airline is hard. But Mr. Chang thinks demand for flights will get better in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 19th, Canon held its 60th-anniversary dinner. Many important business leaders were there. Mr. Dong Jiong-xiong, the founder of Kenmec Group, and his sons Dong Jun-ren and Dong Jun-yi, who will take over the business, were there together. Mr. Chang Kuo-wei, the chairman of STARLUX Airlines, also came to the dinner because Kenmec Group bought shares in STARLUX. Also, Mr. Chang and Dong Jun-yi were friends from studying together in America.</p>
            <p>Kenmec Group bought shares in STARLUX Airlines through its companies Kenmec Innovation and Kenmec Asia. Kenmec Innovation owns 0.29% of STARLUX, and its Vice Chairman, Dong Jun-yi, is now a member of the STARLUX Airlines board of directors.</p>
            <p>However, when STARLUX Airlines started, it faced big problems because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the airline broke even (meaning they didn't lose or make money) because many people started traveling again after the pandemic. They made NTD 0.08 profit per share. In 2024, their profit grew many times, making NTD 0.83 per share. But in the second quarter of this year, their profit went down. They only made 8 million NTD in that quarter.</p>
            <p>The big drop in STARLUX Airlines' profit in the second quarter made people interested. Chairman Chang Kuo-wei openly told reporters from CNA that the first quarter was very good, but the second quarter had "problems from inside and outside," and profit went down a lot. He said that inside the company, the main challenge was that staff costs went up too early. Outside, international taxes and uncertain market conditions made fewer people want to fly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chang further explained that STARLUX Airlines will receive more than 10 new planes next year. To make sure these new planes can start flying right away, they had to hire many staff earlier than usual. He said, "This year, we trained many flight attendants and pilots; there are thousands of flight attendants alone. Paying for them early seems like a 'waste' now. But when the planes arrive, they can start flying immediately. Otherwise, the interest on the planes would be even more expensive."</p>
            <p>Besides problems inside the company, the outside situation also made things worse. He pointed out that because of taxes and unclear government rules, fewer people wanted to fly, especially in the third quarter, which is usually a busy time. The market was still weak. "In past years, July was always the busiest time for tickets after the New Year holiday. But this year, because of predictions of a big economic problem, ticket prices to Japan did not go up. Also, flights to America were affected by taxes and worries about visas. Fewer students are returning, and many business trips have stopped."</p>
            <p>Compared to other airlines, STARLUX also has a basic disadvantage. Mr. Chang said that STARLUX Airlines does not currently have planes just for carrying cargo (goods). So, when fewer people are flying, the airline doesn't have money from cargo to help. "Other airlines might not have many passengers, but they get money from cargo because of taxes that made people ship goods earlier. This helps them. But we lose out more."</p>
            <p>This year, STARLUX Airlines' total profit after tax for the first six months was 923 million NTD. This is 2.54% more than last year. The profit per share was NTD 0.31.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, he believes the situation might get better. As the tax rules become clearer, the demand in the market might slowly come back. But it will still take some time to get back to normal levels.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chang concluded that they originally thought STARLUX Airlines could manage this year if the overall situation was stable. But many unexpected changes happened often, which indeed made running the airline harder.</p>
