            <h1>Man Paralyzed After E-Scooter Hits Pothole; City Office Not Responsible, Court Says</h1>
            <p>A man named Hou was riding an electric scooter in Taipei. He hit a pothole, fell, and became paralyzed in all four limbs. He asked for money from the government. The first court said the Taipei City New Construction Office must pay him 4.67 million NT dollars. But today, a second court changed this decision. They said Mr. Hou took a risk by breaking traffic rules. So, the city office does not have to pay. Mr. Hou can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>This is what happened: On the afternoon of January 28, 2019, Mr. Hou was riding his electric scooter. He came out of an alley near National Taiwan University. He wanted to cross the road to go to the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology parking lot. The road was not smooth, and there was a pothole and an uneven surface. His scooter's front wheel hit the pothole. He flew off the scooter and hit a screw base of a lamppost on the side of the road. He then lost consciousness.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hou was taken to Wanfang Hospital for nearly 10 hours of emergency surgery. Doctors said he had a head injury and a complete spinal cord injury in his neck, which caused paralysis in all four limbs. He stayed in the hospital until December 28, 2019, and then went home to recover.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hou sued the government. He said his central nervous system was badly damaged. He cannot work for the rest of his life and needs someone to care for him 24 hours a day. He asked for over 25.76 million NT dollars from the Taipei City Public Works Department's New Construction Office and National Taiwan University.</p>
            <p>The first court in Taipei believed that the New Construction Office did not manage the road well where the accident happened. However, the court also thought that Mr. Hou was using a scooter meant for parks and squares on the road and towards the sidewalk. This was dangerous. He fell and hit a lamppost, which showed he was not riding slowly. The court decided that Mr. Hou was 80% responsible for the accident. So, they ordered the New Construction Office to pay 4,676,955 NT dollars, and National Taiwan University did not have to pay anything.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hou appealed the case, and the Taiwan High Court heard it. Today, they made their decision. The High Court said that at the time of the accident, electric scooters were not allowed on roads or inside the National Taiwan University campus. Also, the scooter's user manual clearly stated, "Do not ride on public roads."</p>
            <p>The High Court decided that Mr. Hou riding the scooter on the road was a risky action that broke the rules for using roads. This means his case is not covered by the rules for road maintenance. Therefore, the Taipei City New Construction Office and National Taiwan University do not have to pay compensation to the government.</p>
            <p>The High Court's decision also said that the accident spot was an area where a sidewalk without a cover should be. It was also on a road where cars and bicycles enter the university campus, so vehicles do use it. If someone walked or drove normally over the uneven part, it would not be dangerous.</p>
            <p>Based on the judgment, the court found that Mr. Hou was riding his scooter against traffic when leaving the university. He also made a sharp turn onto the sidewalk. The uneven spot would normally not cause an accident. The court said there was no strong link between the uneven spot and Mr. Hou's injuries. So, the court changed the decision, and there will be no government compensation.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Man Seriously Injures Ex-Girlfriend with Stick; Prosecutors Ask for Harsh Punishment</h1>
            <p>A man named Chen from Kaohsiung was angry because his ex-girlfriend, Ms. Wu, met with other men. He thought she had cheated, which led to their breakup. So, on July 25 this year, he used a stick to chase and hit her in the street. Ms. Wu was seriously hurt and almost died. Kaohsiung prosecutors have now charged him with attempted murder and asked the Kaohsiung District Court for a heavy sentence.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office's official document states that Mr. Chen, 47, and Ms. Wu, 48, used to be in a relationship. Mr. Chen was unhappy that Ms. Wu met other men. He believed she had cheated, which was why they broke up. On the morning of July 25 this year, they met in an alley on Hankou Street in Sanmin District to talk. But Mr. Chen then used a wooden stick to chase and hit Ms. Wu in the street. This caused many open wounds and injuries to her head and body. She was taken to the hospital and was in critical condition for a while.</p>
            <p>The police were told about the incident and arrested Mr. Chen within two hours. The case was sent to the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office for investigation. The prosecutors asked for Mr. Chen to be held in custody, and the Kaohsiung District Court agreed to keep him locked up that same evening.</p>
            <p>After finishing their investigation, the prosecutors decided that Mr. Chen's violent actions were very serious. They said his actions greatly affect public safety. So, they charged him with attempted murder. They also asked the Kaohsiung District Court to give him a very strong punishment to uphold the law.</p>
