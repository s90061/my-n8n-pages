Young people, especially those born in the late 1990s and early 2000s, are using AI chatbots like ChatGPT much more often. They use these chatbots to find information for school projects, get quick answers to questions, or even just for friendly conversations. This is a new trend that changes how people learn and share information online. For older generations, search engines were the main tool for finding information. However, some young people find chatbots more direct and easy to use. They might even trust the information from AI more quickly than traditional websites. This change shows how technology is developing quickly and affecting our daily lives, from how we study to how we communicate. This new way of getting information could also change how news and ideas spread in the future.

**New Study: AI Could Significantly Change Many Jobs Worldwide**

A new report suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to have a big impact on jobs across the globe. The study warns that many tasks currently done by people could be taken over or changed by AI technology. This doesn't always mean jobs will disappear entirely, but that the way people work will change a lot. For example, AI might help workers do their jobs more efficiently, or it could take over simple, repetitive tasks. The report looks at how different job sectors, from office work to manufacturing, might be affected. Businesses and governments are now thinking about how to prepare workers for these changes, perhaps by offering new training programs. This is a major discussion point for the future of work and how we can best use AI to help the economy without leaving people behind.

**European Cities Introducing New Rules to Manage Tourism**

Many popular tourist destinations in Europe are facing a challenge known as "overtourism." This happens when too many visitors come to a place at the same time, which can harm the environment, put a strain on local services, and make daily life difficult for residents. To solve this, some cities and regions are starting to introduce new rules and fees. For example, Venice has recently launched a small fee for day-trippers visiting the city. Other places are thinking about limiting the number of visitors to certain areas or increasing fines for bad behavior like littering or damaging historical sites. The main goal is to make tourism more sustainable, so that these beautiful places can be enjoyed by future generations without being damaged. These measures also aim to improve the experience for both tourists and the people who live there.
