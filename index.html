            <h1>Brothers Win by 3 Runs After Losing a 7-Run Lead; Huang Po-to Still Has Much to Learn</h1>
            <p>The CTBC Brothers baseball team had a big lead of 7 runs today. But in the last part of the game, the Wei Chuan Dragons scored 4 runs. The Brothers had to use four different pitchers in that part of the game to stop the Dragons. In the end, the Brothers won the game 10 to 7. The Brothersâ€™ coach, Hirano Keiichi, said that this kind of situation should not happen. He also said that the starting pitcher, Huang Po-to, still has many things to get better at.</p>
            <p>The Brothers scored their first run in the first part of the game. They scored 2 more runs in the third part, 3 runs in the fourth part, and 2 more runs in the fifth part. They also scored 1 run in the seventh and ninth parts of the game. After the top of the ninth inning, they were leading 10 to 3. But in the bottom of the ninth inning, they had problems. They let the other team score 4 runs. They needed to use four pitchers: Chen Po-chun, Hsieh Jung-hao, Tsai Chi-che, and Wu Chun-wei. These pitchers helped to stop the Dragons from scoring more runs and keep the win.</p>
            <p>After the game, Coach Hirano Keiichi talked to reporters. He said that with a 7-run lead in the ninth inning, he decided to let Chen Po-chun pitch first. He hoped Chen Po-chun would do well. He also said that if the lead was smaller, there would be more pressure. He hopes Chen Po-chun will do better next time. About Hsieh Jung-hao, who only pitched to one batter before leaving, Coach Hirano said that all choices were made to win the game.</p>
            <p>Coach Hirano Keiichi said that he always tells the players who hit the ball that even when they are ahead, they must keep scoring more runs. This way, if something difficult happens, like in the bottom of the ninth inning, they will have more ways to manage the game and win. Coach Hirano also said that it is important to not let a big lead become so small that they need to use their best relief pitchers. This situation should be avoided.</p>
            <p>The Brothersâ€™ starting pitcher, Huang Po-to (Humberto Castellanos), threw 95 pitches. He pitched for 6.1 innings. He allowed 12 hits, struck out 3 batters, and walked 1. He gave up 3 runs that counted. He pitched well enough to get his 10th win this year.</p>
            <p>Coach Hirano Keiichi thinks that "Huang Po-to still has a lot of things to improve." He said that Huang should pitch for at least 7 innings and should not be happy with just pitching 6.1 innings. He reminded everyone that there will be more important games in September. He also told them not to forget that the Brothers almost won the first part of the season, but they lost by only a few games.</p>

            <h1>New Medicine Helps When Hormone-Positive Breast Cancer Comes Back as Triple-Negative</h1>
            <p>Emily, who is in her 40s, found out she had breast cancer two years ago during a regular health check. It was called stage 2 hormone-positive breast cancer. She was brave and got treatment, and for a while, she was doing well. But this year, the cancer spread and changed into a different kind called triple-negative breast cancer. After getting two treatments with a new medicine that is covered by national health insurance, her tumor got smaller. She is now smiling again.</p>
            <p>Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer for women in Taiwan. Information from the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that more than ten thousand women get breast cancer every year.</p>
            <p>Patients with breast cancer often feel worried that the cancer might come back. Dr. Yang Ya-wen, a surgeon at National Taiwan University Hospital, often says, "When you leave the doctor's office, you are normal people." She says this to help breast cancer patients go back to their daily lives.</p>
            <p>In a press release today, Dr. Yang Ya-wen told breast cancer patients who have finished their treatment not to worry too much. She said that going back to a normal life is an important goal of their treatment. She also said that treatments are always getting better. Even if the cancer comes back, if patients take their medicine regularly and see their doctor for check-ups, the illness can still be controlled. She added, "You have been through so many hard treatments, and because of this, you know how to value life more than others. You also have more important life experiences."</p>
            <p>Emily is a good example. She always took care of her health. Two years ago, during a regular check-up, she found out she had stage 2 hormone-positive breast cancer. She was a very good patient to the doctors and nurses. When the sickness came, she was brave and had surgery, chemotherapy, and hormone medicine. She also went to her follow-up appointments on time and did what her doctor told her. But this year, doctors found that her cancer cells had moved to other parts of her body. The type of tumor also changed to triple-negative breast cancer.</p>
            <p>After more tests, it was confirmed that Emily's cancer cells were HER2 low-positive. Her doctor decided to use a new type of medicine called antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which the national health insurance pays for. After two treatments, her tumor got smaller, and the extra fluid in her left chest improved. She could breathe better. Now, her condition is stable, and she is slowly feeling less sad. She has found her courage to fight the disease again.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese women get breast cancer most often at two different ages. These ages are between 45 and 49, and between 60 and 64. This is different from Europe and America. Dr. Yang Ya-wen said this might be because of genes. It might also be because of changes in how people eat (more Western food) and how they live. For example, smoking, drinking alcohol, not exercising enough, stress, and changes in hormones can all be reasons. Breast cancer in its early stages often does not cause much pain, so getting regular check-ups is very important.</p>
            <p>Starting this year, the National Health Agency is offering free breast cancer screenings to more women. Before, only women aged 45 to 69 could get them. Now, women aged 40 to 74 can also get them. Dr. Yang Mu-chun, a doctor specializing in blood cancer at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, asks all women to get regular breast cancer screenings. This helps doctors find cancer early and treat it quickly. Early breast cancer usually has a very good outcome. Even if there are problems, he said not to give up, because medical treatments have gotten much better.</p>
            <p>Dr. Yang Mu-chun said that breast cancer treatment is improving very fast. The ADC medicine, which national health insurance started paying for this year, is one example. This medicine combines special treatments and chemotherapy. It attacks cancer cells very carefully and also kills cancer cells nearby. This helps to fight different types of tumor cells. This new treatment helps people with HER2 low-positive breast cancer, which makes up half of all breast cancers. It helps doctors give more exact and personal treatments to each patient.</p>

            <h1>Five People Die in Zhongli House Fire in Taoyuan; Prosecutors Say They Died from Lack of Oxygen</h1>
            <p>This morning, a house fire in Zhongli District, Taoyuan City, caused the death of five people. The reason for the fire is still being looked into. After examining the bodies, the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office believes that all five people died because they could not breathe and lacked oxygen. The office has told the Taoyuan part of the Victims Protection Association to give care and money to the families. This shows the court's kind support.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Fire Department said they got a call at about 5:31 AM. It said there was a house fire on Longan Street in Zhongli District. They quickly sent firefighters and trucks to stop the fire. But sadly, the fire killed five people: Ms. Huang (35 years old), her 10-year-old daughter, and her 9-year-old son. Also, two children of a friend, a 10-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl, died. Fire investigators are still trying to find the exact reason for the fire.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office sent out a press release this evening. It said that Chief Prosecutor Lee Chia-hao and Prosecutor Lai Ying-yu went to the fire place to check things. They also told the police and fire departments to keep looking for evidence.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, the prosecutors and medical examiners looked at the bodies. They found that all five people died because they could not get enough oxygen and their breathing stopped. The office quickly gave the families papers to help them arrange the funerals. Also, the Prosecutors Office quickly told the Taoyuan part of the Victims Protection Association to come and help. They gave each family NT$5,000 to help them. This shows that the court is trying to be kind.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutors Office said they will work with the police and fire departments. They will find out what caused the fire and who is legally responsible. If the families need a place to live or legal help later, the Taoyuan part of the Victims Protection Association will keep helping them.</p>
            <p>The Social Affairs Bureau said that the head of the bureau, Chen Pao-min, went to see the families this morning. He wanted to give them comfort. He also said that Taoyuan Mayor Chang Shan-cheng cared about them. The Social Affairs Bureau also started its plan to help during disasters. Social workers helped right away. They offered emotional help, connected families to different services, and gave them what they needed. They worked with the Education Bureau, local government offices, and other groups. Their goal is to make sure the families have stable lives and to support them through this very difficult time.</p>
