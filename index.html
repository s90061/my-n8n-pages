More and more businesses are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in their hiring process. This technology can quickly go through many job applications, identifying candidates who seem best suited for a role based on skills and experience. Some AI systems can even help with video interviews, analyzing candidates' responses and expressions.

Beyond hiring, AI is also being used to train staff. It can create personalized learning plans for employees, suggesting specific courses or materials based on their job and how they learn. This makes training more efficient and can help workers improve their skills faster.

While AI brings many benefits like saving time and making hiring more efficient, there are also concerns. Critics worry that AI might have biases built into its system, which could unfairly exclude certain candidates. There are also discussions about how much human interaction should be removed from the hiring and training process, and whether AI can truly understand the human element of a job.

**Cities around the world are becoming greener and more walkable.**

Many urban areas are now focusing on creating cities where people can live better and more sustainably. A key idea is to design "15-minute cities," where residents can reach most of their daily needs â€” like shops, schools, parks, and healthcare â€” within a short walk or bike ride from their homes. This reduces the need for cars and promotes a healthier lifestyle.

This new approach to city planning often involves building more green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and tree-lined streets. These spaces not only make cities look nicer but also help improve air quality, manage rainwater, and provide places for people to relax and meet. They also contribute to mental well-being.

By prioritizing pedestrians and cyclists over cars, and improving public transport, cities aim to cut down on pollution and traffic jams. This makes urban life more enjoyable and helps fight climate change. The goal is to build communities that are not only eco-friendly but also stronger and more pleasant for everyone.

**Record heatwaves are changing daily life and travel plans.**

Many parts of the world, especially in Europe and North America, have recently experienced very high temperatures. These record-breaking heatwaves are having a big impact on people's daily routines, their work, and how they travel. As temperatures rise, outdoor activities become difficult and even dangerous.

The tourism industry has been significantly affected. Tourists are now rethinking their summer holiday destinations, with some choosing cooler places or traveling during different times of the year. Popular destinations known for sunny beaches are seeing changes in visitor numbers, as people look for ways to avoid extreme heat.

Workplaces are also adapting. For jobs that require working outside, like construction or agriculture, companies are changing schedules to avoid the hottest parts of the day. This might mean starting earlier or finishing later. There are growing concerns about worker safety and productivity during these intense heat periods, highlighting the wider effects of a changing climate on everyday life.`;
