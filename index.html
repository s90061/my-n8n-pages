            <h1>DPP Election Committee Plans for 2026, Opens Applications Until End of October</h1>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) election committee for the 2026 elections will meet again tomorrow. They will continue to look at possible candidates for mayors and county leaders. The committee uses a special rule for areas where they choose candidates directly. It means that if someone wants to run, they must tell the DPP organization department or Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung or the election committee before 5 PM on October 31.</p>
            <p>The DPP election committee wants to choose all candidates for the 2026 mayoral and county leader elections early. They hope to finish choosing all candidates by the end of January next year, except for a very few difficult areas. The DPP election committee has been meeting a lot recently to check on possible candidates in different areas.</p>
            <p>When the election committee met on October 1 to look at possible candidates, they talked about Taipei City Mayor. Taipei City Councilor Miao Po-ya and Wu Yi-nong, who started the Forward Alliance, were both mentioned. Wu Yi-nong later said in a statement that he "will try to get a chance to serve the citizens." Also, some people in the party said that Lin Yu-chang, the former Keelung Mayor, could also be a surprise candidate for Taipei City Mayor.</p>
            <p>The election committee will meet again tomorrow. Members of the committee explained that each member is in charge of a certain area. After learning more about the areas and opinions on when to hold primary elections, everyone will report on the progress of their areas tomorrow.</p>
            <p>A committee member said that the DPP will allow people to sign up for primary elections in Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Chiayi County. For other areas where candidates are chosen directly, they discussed making a time period. This is to make sure that people who were not talked about, but want to run, can still say they are interested. This avoids missing any good candidates.</p>
            <p>The committee member also said that if someone wants to run, they should tell the DPP organization department, or Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung, or the election committee before 5 PM on October 31.</p>

            <h1>More Than 200,000 Hong Kong Students Visit Mainland China in 3 Years to Boost Patriotism</h1>
            <p>Today, a Hong Kong education official said that more than 200,000 students have visited mainland China for study and exchange. This happened since Hong Kong and mainland China fully opened their borders again in early 2023.</p>
            <p>In 2019, there were protests in Hong Kong. After that, the Hong Kong government started a new subject called "Citizenship and Social Development" (CSD) in the 2021-2022 school year. This new subject replaced the old "Liberal Studies" subject. The CSD subject requires high school students to visit mainland China at least once. This helps students learn about China's situation and development. It also helps them feel more connected to China as a nation.</p>
            <p>Today, Ms. Ip Sau-mei, the Principal Assistant Secretary for Education, wrote on the Education Bureau's website. She said that the Bureau has been working hard to promote CSD visits to mainland China and exchange programs for primary and secondary school students. The goal is to help students learn about China's progress and achievements from different angles. These include history, culture, economy, and technology.</p>
            <p>She said that after Hong Kong and mainland China fully opened their borders, over 200,000 students have joined these CSD visits and exchange programs. She also mentioned that school principals, teachers, and students generally have positive feedback. They believe these exchange activities not only help students see more of the world but also make them feel more connected to China.</p>
            <p>She also shared that the Education Bureau is working closely with mainland China. They are creating new study routes for the CSD visits and student exchange programs in the 2025-2026 school year. These new routes will focus on learning about China's founding history. For example, trips will include visiting the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai, the Chongqing War of Resistance Museum, and the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Continues Checks to Stop Bad Pork Intestines; All 78 Samples Pass Tests</h1>
            <p>Today, the Kaohsiung City Health Bureau said that a company called Baiwei sold bad pork intestines in four different cities and counties. The Health Bureau continued to check places that sell pork intestines, like markets and restaurants. They tested 78 samples for hydrogen peroxide on the spot. All the tests were negative, meaning they followed all rules.</p>
            <p>A food company that worked at a slaughterhouse in Pingtung County was suspected of soaking pork intestines in industrial hydrogen peroxide. Then, they sold these intestines, and they went to Kaohsiung City and three other cities and counties.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau released a press release today. It said that they continued to check places selling pork intestines, such as markets and restaurants. They have now checked a total of 423 places. They also tested 78 samples of pork intestines for hydrogen peroxide on the spot. All the results were negative, meaning everything met the rules.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau explained earlier that they received a notice from the Pingtung County Health Bureau. This notice said that the bad products went to a frozen food store in Kaohsiung City. The store received 36 kilograms in August and 90 kilograms in September. The store owner said that the first batch was for a ship's food supplier, but it was not used and was returned. The second batch was destroyed by the store itself.</p>
            <p>To make sure that pork intestine products sold in the city are safe, the Health Bureau started checking places that sell them yesterday. They used a test kit to check for hydrogen peroxide right away. The results from yesterday and today were all negative, meaning all products followed the rules.</p>
