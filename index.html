            <h1>Three-Star Life Insurance Company Earned NT$940 Million in First Three Quarters, But Net Value Ratio Still Below 3% Target</h1>
            <p>Three-Star Life Insurance Company announced its financial report for the first three quarters of this year today. The company's net profit after tax was NT$940 million, and its earnings per share were NT$0.16. Because the Taiwan stock market grew a lot, Three-Star Life Insurance Company sold some investments at a good time. This helped to lessen the effect of the New Taiwan Dollar getting stronger in the first three quarters. By the end of the third quarter, the company's net value was NT$40.8 billion, and its net value ratio went up to 2.98%. However, this is still less than the legal target of 3%.</p>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) checks insurance companies every six months. It requires that an insurance company's RBC (Risk-Based Capital) ratio must not be lower than 200%, and its net value ratio must not be below 3% for two periods in a row. These two numbers help the FSC to see if an insurance company can pay its debts. By the end of June this year, Three-Star Life Insurance Company's RBC ratio was 154.27%, and its net value ratio was 2.31%.</p>
            <p>Three-Star Life Insurance Company announced its financial report for the first three quarters today. Its total net profit after tax was NT$940 million, and its earnings per share were NT$0.16. The company said that the main reason for this was the strong growth in the Taiwan stock market. The company changed its investments to earn more money from stocks. It sold investments when prices were high. Also, the company followed new rules from the FSC about reserves and put more money aside for changes in foreign exchange rates. This helped to reduce the big effect of the New Taiwan Dollar getting much stronger against the US Dollar in the first three quarters.</p>
            <p>By the end of the third quarter, Three-Star Life Insurance Company's net value was NT$40.8 billion. Its net value ratio went up to 2.98%, but it was still below the legal target of 3%. The company's total assets reached NT$1.6 trillion.</p>
            <p>Three-Star Life Insurance Company stated that in the first three quarters of this year, its new contract premium income (FYP) was NT$25.93 billion. This is a 17% increase compared to the same period last year. Investment-linked products made up 86% of the FYP, showing that these products continue to drive sales growth. For traditional products, the company also did well in selling interest-sensitive products. In the first three quarters of this year, the FYP for interest-sensitive life insurance grew by a large 93% compared to last year. Also, the company is preparing for future accounting rules (IFRS 17) by offering new health and accident insurance products.</p>
            <p>Three-Star Life Insurance Company pointed out that in recent years, the economies of both the world and Taiwan have continued to recover steadily. The Taiwan stock market has grown strongly, led by the technology and semiconductor industries. In important international markets, new technology and the expectation of lower interest rates have also helped. Three-Star Life Insurance Company has made excellent profits from its investments in stocks both in Taiwan and overseas. Its performance in the first three quarters was better than in the same period last year. In the future, the company will continue to aim for stable income and look for more opportunities to grow.</p>
            <p>Three-Star Life Insurance Company said that it will keep changing its investment and risk management plans to earn more money. It will also make its capital stronger by getting more cash and issuing bonds. In addition, the company is actively working to develop valuable products that will help it meet the new IFRS 17 accounting rules and satisfy the needs of its customers.</p>

            <h1>Sexual Harassment Allegation Was a Misunderstanding; Hsinchu Acting Mayor Chiu Chen-yuan Says He Has Forgiven and Settled the Matter</h1>
            <p>Today, Hsinchu City's Acting Mayor Chiu Chen-yuan spoke about a sexual harassment accusation made against him two years ago. A former assistant to a Taiwan People's Party lawmaker had accused him. The assistant has now stated that "the accusations were a misunderstanding." Chiu Chen-yuan also wrote online that both sides have settled the matter. He said that the truth is clear, and "when facing hurt, I choose to forgive."</p>
            <p>Chiu Chen-yuan wrote on his Facebook page this evening that for two years, he and his family have been under a lot of stress and misunderstood because of false sexual harassment accusations. He faced political attacks and public criticism. He chose to trust the law and the truth.</p>
            <p>Chiu Chen-yuan explained that after going through all the legal steps and talking with the other person, "Ms. Wu Fu-tung officially reached a settlement with me on October 14, 2025. On October 16, 2025, she made a public statement on her Facebook page. She confirmed that her original accusations were a misunderstanding and removed the false posts. She also published a notice to clear my name." Chiu Chen-yuan's post included Ms. Wu's Facebook statement.</p>
            <p>He also said, "When facing hurt, I choose to forgive." He believes that being reasonable and forgiving can heal pain and bring society closer together.</p>
            <p>Chiu Chen-yuan mentioned that for him, being innocent is not just about his own good name. It also means explaining things to his family, colleagues, supporters, and the people of the city. He hopes that friends who care about this issue can let go of the past. He wants them to focus again on Hsinchu City. In the future, he will continue to work on city matters with a more humble and focused attitude.</p>
