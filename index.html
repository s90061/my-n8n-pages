            <h1>Chinese Student Questioned for 10 Hours, Sent Back from U.S.</h1>
            <p>A Chinese student with a valid visa recently went to the U.S. for his studies. However, when he arrived, customs officers questioned him for 10 hours in three different sessions. They focused on his connection to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). After this, he was sent back to China and cannot enter the U.S. for five years. This student planned to study philosophy, not sensitive subjects like AI. The notice he received for being sent back said his "documents were incomplete."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported yesterday that the 22-year-old philosophy student named Gu flew for 29 hours to Texas. He was going to study at the University of Houston. He had all his papers ready and a full scholarship. He thought there would be no problems.</p>
            <p>However, he was stopped and questioned at the airport. After being in the U.S. for 36 hours, he was sent back to China. His dream of studying in America suddenly ended. Gu said, "I cannot live the life I hoped for."</p>
            <p>He is one of many Chinese students who had permission to enter the U.S. but were sent back, or who faced long questions after arriving. We don't know the exact number of students. This has made Beijing very upset. It also shows the uncertainty caused by changes in policies related to former President Trump.</p>
            <p>The Trump government first planned to cancel visas for Chinese students. But then, Mr. Trump himself said he would welcome hundreds of thousands of Chinese students to study in the U.S. This was partly to help some American schools stay open.</p>
            <p>Even so, some officials and lawmakers are still worried about Chinese students. They are especially concerned about students studying advanced technology like quantum computing and artificial intelligence. They also suspect some students might have links to the Chinese government and military. Some lawmakers even want to stop all Chinese students from entering the U.S.</p>
            <p>We don't have exact numbers yet for how many Chinese students with valid visas have been questioned or sent back at U.S. airports in recent weeks. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not yet provided information about these cases or the numbers.</p>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump recently said he told Chinese President Xi Jinping, "We are honored to have their students here. Of course, we will check carefully to see who exactly (is coming to the U.S.)."</p>
            <p>The report also stated that the Chinese Embassy said it has received reports of more than a dozen Chinese students and researchers being questioned, bothered, and sent back when entering the U.S.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy released a statement saying, "The U.S. often uses unfair and politically motivated rules against Chinese students and researchers. This causes them emotional and physical harm, financial losses, and stops their careers." The U.S. sends them back using reasons like "visa problems" or "possible harm to U.S. national security."</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy pointed out that these students and researchers were taken to small rooms for long questioning. They were asked questions that were not related to their studies. They were also forced to wait for many hours in cold rooms without blankets. Some used aluminum foil to keep warm. Some were held for over 80 hours.</p>
            <p>Last week, Trump told a conservative news website, The Daily Caller, "When you say you won't accept students from a certain country, that is a big insult to that country."</p>
            <p>"I think what we are doing is right. It is good to get along with all countries, not bad, especially with countries that have nuclear weapons."</p>
            <p>The student named Gu told the Associated Press that he really enjoyed his time as an exchange student at Cornell University before. Because of this, he applied for a Master's degree in philosophy in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Even though there were reports that the Trump government was making rules for foreign students stricter, Gu said he was not too worried. He also wasn't worried when customs stopped him at Houston Airport and took him to a room for questions.</p>
            <p>He said his belongings were searched, and his electronic devices were taken. After checking his devices, customs officers started to question him. They mainly asked about his connection to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
            <p>Like almost all Chinese young people, Gu was a member of the Communist Youth League of China. He said his parents were party members, but he himself never joined the party.</p>
            <p>Customs officers also asked him about his connection to the China Scholarship Council. This information appeared in his chat messages. Gu said the name "China Scholarship Council" came up in talks with his classmates, but he did not receive money from the Chinese government.</p>
            <p>When Gu was told he would be sent back, he had been awake for almost 40 hours. The waiting room where he was held had bright lights on for 24 hours, and the room was very cold.</p>
            <p>"I was shaking because I was cold and nervous," Gu said. "Now that I am being sent back, many thoughts are going through my mind. What will I do in the future?"</p>
            <p>He was held for another day before being put on a flight. Gu is now thinking about appealing this decision, but it could take several years and cost thousands of dollars.</p>

            <h1>Technical University of Munich and TSMC to Open AI Chip Research Center</h1>
            <p>The government of Bavaria, Germany, announced today that it will work with TSMC. They will open an AI chip research and development center at the Technical University of Munich. The goal is to make Europe better at designing computer chips and to train more German people for the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from Bavaria's Ministry of Economic Affairs, the AI chip research and development center will be called the "Munich Advanced Center for High-Tech AI Chips" (MACHT-AI). It will be located at the Technical University of Munich and led by Professor Hussam Amrouch from the university.</p>
            <p>The AI chip research center will focus on making powerful and custom-made AI chips. It will also train students and researchers to use special manufacturing methods, including FinFET technology. TSMC will help with the technology needed.</p>
            <p>Professor Thomas Hofmann, the president of the Technical University of Munich, said that Professor Amrouch is a key expert in hardware design at the university. The new center will help the university teach and research more about FinFET processes and AI hardware design. It will also create new chances for the Technical University of Munich and TSMC to work together.</p>
            <p>The Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will both pay for the AI chip research center. The total cost will be around 4.5 million Euros, which is about 160 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Markus Blume, the Bavarian State Minister of Science, said, "Thanks to our cooperation with TSMC, we will be able to train local talented people in the most advanced chip technology in the world."</p>
            <p>Hubert Aiwanger, Bavaria's Minister of Economic Affairs, explained that Europe currently needs more skilled workers in AI chip design. The AI chip research center will help fill this gap in Germany's semiconductor workforce.</p>
            <p>In May this year, TSMC also announced at the European Technology Forum that it would open a chip design center in Munich. This center will help European customers create powerful chips for things like cars, artificial intelligence, and industrial internet of things. It is expected to start working in the third quarter of this year.</p>

            <h1>Brazil to Fight U.S. Tariffs, Aims for WTO Changes with BRICS Nations</h1>
            <p>Brazil is reacting to new, high taxes from U.S. President Trump. The Brazilian government is actively working to change the World Trade Organization (WTO). They are also planning an online meeting for BRICS country leaders in September. The goal is to agree on how to change the global trade system.</p>
            <p>According to CNN Brazil, Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira recently spoke at the Federation of Industries of the State of SÃ£o Paulo (Fiesp). He said that Brazil has talked with countries like Mexico, India, and France, which are also affected by U.S. taxes. They all share worries about problems in the international trade system. He said that Brazil wants to make big changes to the WTO so it can be more modern and flexible.</p>
            <p>Since 2019, the U.S. has stopped the appointment of judges for the WTO's appeal body. This has caused the system for solving trade disagreements to stop working. This problem has continued through both the Trump and Biden governments. Brazil believes this stop to the system makes it harder for weaker countries to stand up to trade pressure. It also harms fair and stable global trade.</p>
            <p>Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva is working to bring together the leaders of the BRICS countries for an online meeting. He plans to invite Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and new members Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran.</p>
            <p>Even though the BRICS countries are careful not to directly criticize the U.S., they clearly spoke against "one-sided protectionist actions" at a meeting in Rio in July. This shows they are not happy with the current trade rules.</p>
            <p>President Lula has also recently spoken with Xi Jinping, Modi, Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. They talked about working together with many countries and making trade partnerships bigger.</p>
            <p>Also, Brazil announced it is restarting talks with Canada about a free trade agreement. Vice President and Minister of Industry and Trade Geraldo Alckmin also went to Mexico and India. He went there to make economic cooperation between these countries stronger.</p>
            <p>Minister Vieira said that the U.S. tariffs are connected to legal cases about former President Bolsonaro and his staff possibly trying to damage democracy. He called these tariffs "political actions." He also said that Brazil will not accept any talks that involve legal interference. Brazil will stick to its principles of national power and rule of law.</p>
