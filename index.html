**Sou Fujimoto's First Big Exhibition Shows Small Model of "Grand Roof Ring"**

The Mori Art Museum in Japan is holding the first large exhibition for famous architect Sou Fujimoto. It shows models of his work and his personal timeline. There is also a 1/5 scale model of the "Grand Roof Ring," which is over 4 meters tall. This lets people see a mini version even if they cannot go to the Osaka Expo.

Sou Fujimoto was born in Hokkaido in 1971. He has architecture offices in Tokyo, Paris, and Shenzhen. He has designed homes, universities, shops, hotels, and other buildings. His work in Taiwan includes "Nan Cheng Hong Shi" in Tainan.

He became well-known in 2000 with his design for the "Aomori Museum of Art Design Competition." After that, he completed projects like the "Musashino Art University Museum & Library" in Tokyo and the "Serpentine Gallery Summer Pavilion" in London. He is also the design director for the 2025 World Expo in Osaka, where he designed the "Grand Roof" (Grand Roof Ring), which is the most important building for the Expo.

The exhibition, "Sou Fujimoto: Futures of the Primitive Architecture," is at the Mori Art Museum from July 2 to November 9. It is his first big solo exhibition and shows his main projects from nearly 30 years. Fujimoto said the exhibition was inspired by the forests in his home, Hokkaido. He believes a "forest-like place" can accept many different things, which is why he used the word "Mori" (forest) in the exhibition title.

He explained that "forest" means more than just a real forest with trees. It also means a forest in architecture and a forest as a city environment. The first room has many models, placed like a "model forest." He wants people to feel the architectural forest by looking at the whole space.

The exhibition has 8 areas. In the "Forest of Thought," over 100 models of Fujimoto's projects are shown in a space larger than 300 square meters. Some hang in the air, some are on shelves, generally placed in order of when they were made. It looks like a huge art piece.

The "Forest of Trajectories" shows Fujimoto's career path. It includes his work timeline, important architecture events in Japan and worldwide, and general news. The "Forest of Shimmer" shows 5 models that use projection technology, allowing people to see how their movements interact with the architectural models, showing that buildings are dynamic spaces, not just static boxes.

"Open Ring" is the main part of the exhibition. It shows a 1/5 scale model of the Osaka Expo's "Grand Roof Ring," which is 2 kilometers long, 20 meters high, and 30 meters wide. On the floor, there are white human figures in different poses, like parents with children or friends taking photos. Fujimoto himself guided the design of these poses.

Besides completed buildings, the exhibition also includes a 1/15 scale model of the "Sendai City International Center North Area Complex (Tentative)," which is expected to finish in 2031. This building will be both a concert hall and a memorial for disasters, and its model hangs from the ceiling.

The final part of the exhibition is "Forest of the Future, Forest of the Primitive - Resonating City 2025," made with Hiroaki Miyata, one of the Osaka Expo pavilion leaders. It uses 3D-printed sphere models and videos to show a city of the future. The spheres, of different sizes, connect freely in vertical, horizontal, and diagonal ways. Each sphere might be a home, a school, or a park, holding all the functions a city needs.

Fujimoto said that current cities are built with the same floors stacked on top of each other, connected by vertical elevators. His idea for a future city does not need elevators. Instead, people could move freely in three dimensions using personal drone-like devices. The Osaka Expo's goal is to imagine a future society, and he hopes this idea, with help from AI, will be a starting point for thinking about future life.

**Wu Shih-yi Dominates Opponent, Secures Bronze in WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing Tournament**

Taiwan's female boxer Wu Shih-yi showed great power today in the 57kg quarter-finals of the WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing Tournament. She faced Sameenah Toussaint from England and won all three rounds easily, with a score of 5-0. This win puts her in the semi-finals and guarantees her at least a bronze medal.

Wu Shih-yi won a bronze medal in the 60kg class at the Paris Olympics. This year, she moved to the 57kg class and is still doing very well. She won gold at the Strandja International Boxing Tournament in early March. Although she stopped at the quarter-finals in her first WB Cup Brazil event in late March, she then won a silver medal at the Thailand Open in May.

In this WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing Tournament, which gives world ranking points, Wu Shih-yi beat her Uzbek opponent 5-0 in the first round. Today, in the quarter-finals against Toussaint, she again showed strong attacking and defending skills. She controlled the first round, and all five judges gave her 10 points.

In the second round, Wu Shih-yi attacked well many times. Her excellent fake moves and counter-attacks made it hard for her opponent. All five judges gave Wu Shih-yi a perfect score of 10 points again.

With the win almost certain, Wu Shih-yi played steadily in the third round, using a defensive counter-attack strategy. In the end, all five judges gave Wu Shih-yi 10 points for all three rounds, and she easily won with a 5-0 score.

Coach Ko Wen-ming told the Central News Agency that Shih-yi performed her strategy very well today. He said she perfectly controlled the distance from her opponent and used almost all the skills she practices.

Ko Wen-ming stressed, "We have been working to make Shih-yi more confident. She is a very smart and skilled boxer. She has had more matches this year, which has made her more stable and confident than before."

Ko Wen-ming explained that Toussaint's style was very aggressive, but after Shih-yi landed a few defensive counter-attacks, Toussaint became scared. "So the match went at our speed, and we were able to win it easily," he added.

Taiwan sent 7 boxers to this WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing Tournament. Only Wu Shih-yi has reached the semi-finals; all others have been eliminated.
