            <h1>Markets Wait for US Inflation Data and US-China Tariff War Progress; Most Asian Stocks Close Higher</h1>
            <p>Most Asian stock markets closed higher today. Investors are focusing on US inflation numbers that will come out this week, and the latest news about the US-China tariff war truce which is about to end.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that US President Donald Trump will say that the 90-day tariff war agreement with China, made in May, will continue. This agreement ends tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Also, the US will release important consumer price index (CPI) data tomorrow. This data might affect the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) future decisions. The Fed is feeling more and more pressure from Trump to lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>Many economic reports have come out, especially new job numbers. They show that the US economy is growing slower. So, investors are now more sure that the Fed will lower borrowing costs at its meeting in September.</p>
            <p>The US-China tariff war agreement ends tomorrow, and investors think both sides will extend it.</p>
            <p>Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group in Australia, said: "The market fully expects that the tariff war truce will probably be extended for another 90 days."</p>
            <p>"So, unless the talks between the two countries completely fail, the news about the truce being extended should not cause big changes in the market."</p>
            <p>Stock markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, and Taipei closed higher today. Stock markets in Seoul, Singapore, and Manila fell. The Tokyo stock market was closed for a public holiday.</p>

            <h1>Yilan County Election: Huang Kuo-chang Happy to Talk About Working with KMT</h1>
            <p>Today, Huang Kuo-chang, who is the leader of the Taiwan People's Party, talked about the 2026 Yilan County election. He said that if it is good for the country, its people, and the land, the Taiwan People's Party is very willing and ready to discuss the best way to work with other parties, like the Kuomintang (KMT), for Yilan and its people.</p>
            <p>He said that everyone should come out and vote in the referendum on the 23rd, no matter which party they support. This is for the land, the people, and the country. He believes that this same spirit and values can continue from 2026 to 2028. He said that parties not in power will work together with great honesty and kindness. They will not let the Democratic Progressive Party rule Taiwan alone and act like a dictator.</p>
            <p>The referendum question is: "Do you agree that the third nuclear power plant should continue to run after the authorities confirm it is safe?" On the afternoon of the 23rd, Huang Kuo-chang went to Yilan Sports Park to promote the vote. Chen Wan-hui, who leads the Taiwan People's Party in Yilan, Wu Tsung-hsien, a KMT lawmaker, and Chang Sheng-te, the speaker of the Yilan County Council, were there. They held signs that said, "Fight for Taiwan, vote 'yes' for Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 extension on August 23."</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang told reporters that the most important thing is to fight for Taiwan on the 23rd. He asked all people in Yilan to come out and vote. He said that people deciding for themselves in Taiwan and Yilan is a value and belief that everyone shares. He also told the people of Yilan, "Please believe that we love Yilan, we love this land, and we want to protect our people, just like you do."</p>

            <h1>Final Meeting with Trump? Cheng Li-chun: Will Only Discuss After Reaching a Certain Point</h1>
            <p>Regarding whether the final meeting about equal tariffs will involve talks with US President Trump, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun said that this will only happen after the discussions have reached a certain stage. She cannot answer for the US. Soon, she will talk with high-tech companies to see if their investments in the US can help Taiwan and the US work together strategically on supply chains. This will help them get better results in the talks.</p>
            <p>Today, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun, Secretary-General Kung Ming-hsin, Minister without Portfolio and Chief Negotiator Yang Jen-ni, Deputy Minister of Finance Ruan Ching-hua, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Chin-tsang, Deputy Minister of Labor Lee Chien-hung, and Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture Lin Chia-jung attended a press conference at the Executive Yuan. They explained issues related to US equal tariffs and plans to support industries.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked if the final meeting about tariffs would involve direct talks with President Trump.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chun pointed out that the US hopes other countries will open their markets more. This is a very important part of the talks. Some countries offer zero tariffs on all goods, while others offer zero tariffs or good prices on 98% or 99% of goods. Taiwan and the US are still talking. The US also hopes Taiwan will lower its tariffs. But the details will only be explained after a final decision is made.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chun also said that countries reach agreements in different ways. Sometimes, Trump talks with leaders of other countries. Other times, he meets with negotiators. For how the news will be shared, it could be a joint statement from both sides, a document from the White House, or an announcement from Trump on social media.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chun said that Taiwan has made some progress in the technical talks. Next, they will talk more about Section 232, working together on supply chains, and investments. They hope to lower tariffs again and get better conditions under Section 232. But how this will happen will be clearer after both sides reach an agreement. Right now, she cannot speak for the US. The final meeting will only be discussed after the talks have reached a certain point.</p>
            <p>Also, reporters asked if the government could try to finish the talks within one month. They also asked if TSMC or related supply chain companies might join the government in the talks.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chun said that industries face pressure every day. The government will do its best to finish the talks quickly. But this also depends on both sides. Last week, Taiwan started two video meetings. Talks can happen at any time. This week, talks might continue online or in person.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chun said that the negotiation team will keep working to get better tax rates. They will also try to create a fairer environment for industries that invest in the US. Soon, she will invite high-tech companies to talk. When companies invest more in the US, they can work together to help Taiwan and the US have more strategic cooperation in supply chains. This kind of strategic plan will help create a good base for talks, get better results, and build a strategic partnership with the US in high-tech.</p>
            <p>She said that while the tariff talks started because of a trade imbalance, the US wants to be the world's AI center in the future. Taiwan has always worked well with the US in semiconductors and high-tech industries. So, there is a lot of room for cooperation between them in the future. This is also strategic cooperation. She hopes that the results of the talks will not only lower tariffs but also open up better international plans for industry and economy.</p>
