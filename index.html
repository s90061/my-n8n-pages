            <h1>Taiwan Stock Market Reaches New High, Then Falls 130 Points Below 26800</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan stock market started high with a lot of trading, but then went down. During the day, the index reached 27507.16 points, which was a new record. But later, many people started selling stocks. The index then fell from positive to negative. It went below 26800 points and closed at 26793.15 points. This was a drop of 130.27 points. The total value of shares traded was NT$683.169 billion, the most in over four months.</p>
            <p>TSMC's stock price moved up and down. During the day, it went up to NT$1460, setting a new high price. But by the end of trading, its gains were smaller. It closed at NT$1425, up by NT$10. Its total market value was NT$36.95 trillion. This helped the main index by about 80 points. Other important and expensive stocks like Hon Hai, Delta Electronics, Quanta, ASPEED, and Alchip-KY all went down. The overall electronics sector index dropped by 0.63%.</p>
            <p>Most traditional industry stocks also fell. The cable and glass industry indexes dropped by over 5%, showing they were weak. The plastic and electrical machinery industry indexes dropped by over 2%. China announced it will charge a "special port fee" for ships owned, operated, or flagged by the U.S. Because of this, shipping costs quickly increased. This led to strong gains for companies like Yang Ming and Wan Hai, whose stocks went up to their highest allowed daily limit. The shipping industry index rose by 3.92%, showing strong performance.</p>

            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai: No Solar Panels in Reservoirs if Water Quality Cannot Be Managed</h1>
            <p>Cleaning solar panels in Wushantou Reservoir has caused some concern. Premier Cho Jung-tai spoke in the Legislative Yuan today. He said that the government has watched reservoirs with solar panels for a long time. The water quality has not been affected. However, in the future, if the government cannot manage water quality problems, it will not build more solar panels. This is unless they can fully control the technology.</p>
            <p>Recently, people have been talking about the solar panels on the water in Tainan's Wushantou Reservoir. Today, the Legislative Yuan continued its general policy questions. Legislator Huang Kuo-chang from the Taiwan People's Party said that he found public information showing that other reservoirs also have solar panels. These include Fengshan Reservoir, Yanshuipei Reservoir, Jinhu Reservoir, Neipuzi Reservoir, and Agongdian Reservoir. This has made people worried about their drinking water.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang pointed out that the Democratic Progressive Party's website has a section to correct false information. It says that the solar panels in Wushantou are not toxic and will not pollute drinking water. But he asked if the government will continue to put solar panels in reservoirs or stop doing so.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai replied that developing different kinds of green energy is a big government plan. He said the government has watched the solar panels in reservoirs for a long time, and the water quality has not been affected. But in the future, if the government cannot manage the problems with solar panels and water quality, it will not build more. This is only if they can fully control the technology and safely monitor it.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang noted that in the past, laws did not require environmental impact assessments before installing solar panels. This led to solar panels being put on hillsides, protected areas, sea areas, and reservoirs. Currently, the Ministry of Environment is discussing whether to require these assessments. However, solar power companies are also pushing forward. For example, one company said in an August meeting that the second phase of floating solar panels for Wushantou Reservoir is being prepared. He asked if the government will allow this second phase to happen.</p>
            <p>Minister of Economic Affairs Kung Ming-hsin said that local governments have not agreed, so this project is not happening right now.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang asked if environmental impact assessments would be needed for solar panels over a certain size in national scenic areas or sensitive areas. Premier Cho Jung-tai answered that sensitive areas and scenic areas need government protection.</p>
