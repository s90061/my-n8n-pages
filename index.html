            <h1>Zelensky to Visit US to Meet Trump, Discuss Ukraine's Air Defense and Pressure on Russia</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that he will go to Washington this week. He will meet with US President Trump. They will talk about Ukraine's air defense and how to hit targets far away. They will also discuss how to put more pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>News agencies like AFP and Reuters reported that Zelenskyy will join a Ukrainian group already in Washington. This group is meeting with American politicians and businesses. Zelenskyy hopes to meet Trump on October 17th.</p>
            <p>He said he talked to Trump twice over the weekend. They discussed problems caused by Russia attacking Ukraine's power systems. They also talked about the situation on the battlefield. This included the idea of the US giving Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Ukraine has always wanted these American-made Tomahawk missiles. These missiles can fly up to 2,500 kilometers. If launched from Ukraine, they could hit any place in European Russia, including Moscow. Ukraine has promised to use them only for clear military targets. But Moscow has warned that this could make the situation much worse.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv, "Honestly, I have already shared our thoughts with Trump. But some things are not good to say on the phone, so we will talk face-to-face."</p>
            <p>He said, "We talked about some difficult topics. Our conversation was full, but not enough." Zelenskyy is also hosting Kaja Kallas, who is a top official for foreign policy and security in the European Union. She is visiting Kyiv.</p>
            <p>Trump said he is thinking about giving these missiles to Ukraine. He also said he might talk about this with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy mentioned that the Ukrainian group that already left for the US includes Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, National Security and Defense Council head Rustem Umerov, and other diplomats.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said he plans to meet with people from American defense companies and members of Congress.</p>
            <p>He stated, "The main topics include air defense and how we can put pressure on Russia."</p>
            <p>Ukraine and the US are also close to making an important agreement about drones. With this agreement, Ukraine will share drone technology with the US. European diplomats think such agreements are important to keep Trump interested in and supporting Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Prague Press Film Festival Focuses on Journalists' Situation, Resisting Powerful Pressure</h1>
            <p>The second Prague Press Film Festival recently happened in Prague. Its main topic was "Journalism Under Pressure." It looked at the difficult moral choices journalists face, how information is controlled, and threats from politics. The festival focused on how reporters can stay independent and honest when businesses, powerful people, and governments put pressure on them.</p>
            <p>The Prague Press Play festival website said that today, with more strong political differences and too much fake news, journalists are more important than ever. They find the truth and protect democracy. But they are also more easily hurt. This year's festival explored the complex relationship between news companies and powerful groups. It examined how journalists deal with hard ethical decisions and keep their professional honesty. This happens even when businesses, rich people, governments, and other strong forces keep putting pressure on them.</p>
            <p>The festival showed a special selection of films. These films let people see the moral problems and personal sacrifices in journalism. The festival said, "These films not only honor reporters who do everything to find the truth. They also strongly remind us how important press freedom is and the dangers it faces."</p>
            <p>In the festival's competition section, there was a Ukrainian film called "Faces of Torture." It showed the harsh conditions in Russian prisons and how they affect war reporting. A Hungarian film, "The Dynasty," investigated corruption in the family of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. An Uruguayan film, "El Facilitador," looked closely at how politics can be controlled. These films showed the problems reporters face in different countries. "The Dynasty" won this year's "Best Audience Award."</p>
            <p>The festival also showed a documentary called "Truth at a Cost: Vladyslav Yesypenko's Story." This film showed what happened to Vladyslav Yesypenko, a Ukrainian journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In 2021, Russian forces arrested him in Crimea, and he was badly treated in prison.</p>
            <p>He once said, "My only crime was being a journalist." Luckily, he was finally freed and went back to Ukraine. After the film, Yesypenko came to talk with the audience. He shared his experience and asked people to value the work of journalists.</p>
            <p>Also, the festival showed "Big Boys Gone Bananas!*" This film was about documentary director Fredrik Gertten. He revealed that Dole Food Company used harmful pesticides in its banana farms in Nicaragua. This caused farm workers to become unable to have children and suffer from health problems. Because of this, Dole started a legal fight to try to scare Gertten, make him give up, and stay silent. At a discussion after the film, Gertten talked about dealing with pressure from a big company. He also discussed how ordinary people, the media, and audiences can help protect democracy and freedom.</p>

            <h1>Guangfu Township Office: Creating a Household Security Roster</h1>
            <p>A natural dam in the Mata'an River caused serious damage in Guangfu, Hualien. Some people posted a video online. In the video, a neighborhood leader had a form for a household safety list. People thought this was to fake a list of people who left their homes earlier. But the Guangfu Township Office said that it was a real list for a planned evacuation.</p>
            <p>A video was shared in a Facebook group called "Guangfu People of Hualien." In the video, a neighborhood leader from Daping Village had a form. The village worker gave him this form, which was called "List of Households Affected by Mata'an River Dam (Central Area Defined on September 21st)." The leader was asking people to fill it out house by house.</p>
            <p>The form asked about living conditions, mobile phone numbers, how people would evacuate (go to an upper floor, stay with family, or go to a shelter), and emergency contact phone numbers.</p>
            <p>In the video, a person asked, "Why does this list say September 21st? They are only asking now, and it's already October 13th." The neighborhood leader replied, "He printed it, how should I know? He's going to collect it tomorrow." The person then said, "No one told us before, and now they want us to write down evacuation records. This is like falsifying documents." The person also told the leader to be more careful now.</p>
            <p>Today, the Guangfu Township Office released a statement to clarify. They said that based on the updated Mata'an River Dam evacuation plan from the central coordination office and Hualien County government, they need to check all houses in the affected areas. These areas include 10 villages: Daping, Dama, Da'an, Dahua, Datong, Dajin, Daquan, Dongfu, Beifu, and Xifu.</p>
            <p>The Guangfu Township Office explained that the list is to find out which households in the danger area do not have a second floor or higher to go to, and also different groups of people who need more help. They are making a list with their contact information. When a warning is given, these people should be moved out first. After they collect all the information, it will be used to plan shelters.</p>
            <p>Lin Qing-shui, the head of Guangfu Township, said in a phone interview today that the leaders of the 10 villages are visiting each house. They are checking how people live and if there are people who need to leave first because they are vulnerable. This is part of the evacuation plan survey.</p>
            <p>Some people questioned if this was to fake evacuation records for September 21st. Lin Qing-shui denied this. He said, "September 21st has already passed. Why would we ask people to sign for that?"</p>
