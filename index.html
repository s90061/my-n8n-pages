            <h1>Legislature to Review Youth Basic Law Draft on August 14th; Youth Groups Call for Quick Approval</h1>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan is expected to review the draft of the Youth Basic Law on August 14. Today, youth groups shared their requests. They want youth participation rules to be clearly written into the law. They also want a special office at the Executive Yuan level to be created. They are asking all political parties to discuss the law calmly and pass it quickly.</p>
            <p>Today, several youth groups released a press statement. These groups include the Generations Co-prosperity Association, Taiwan Youth Rights and Welfare Promotion Alliance, Taiwan Youth Democracy Association, Taiwan EDU Association, and Soochow Island Society. They said that 38 lawmakers in the current Legislative Yuan have already proposed a draft of the "Youth Basic Law." They pointed out that these lawmakers are from different parties, which shows how important they think the Youth Basic Law is.</p>
            <p>Zhang Yumeng, who is the chairman of the Generations Co-prosperity Association, said that the Youth Basic Law should legally define "youth." It should say that young people are aged between 18 and 35. He suggested that youth affairs in the central government should be more important. He proposed setting up a "Youth Development Committee" or "Youth Development Office" under the Executive Yuan. He also said that ways for youth to give advice and take part in public matters should be written into law. He added that every city and county should have ways for young people to participate, to make sure everyone has an equal chance.</p>
            <p>Zhang Youjia, the deputy secretary-general of the Taiwan Youth Rights and Welfare Promotion Alliance, mentioned that the Youth Basic Law should also include young people aged 15 to 17. He also said that a special office at the Executive Yuan level should be created. This office would help bring youth policies together and give more power to young people. This would stop policies from being messy and resources from being wasted.</p>
            <p>Chen Yijin, who is a permanent supervisor of the Taiwan Youth Democracy Association, believes that systems for youth advice and public participation should become law. He said that both central and local governments should have clear, steady, working, and responsible systems. All 22 cities and counties in Taiwan should have youth participation systems. This would make sure that youth participation systems are legal, the same in all 22 cities and counties, and have a real effect.</p>
            <p>Lin Sikang, the president of Soochow Island Society, pointed out that university students come from all parts of Taiwan. He supports setting up youth participation systems in all 22 cities and counties as part of the Youth Basic Law. This would give all young people, whether they live in a city or their hometown, and whether they can vote or not, a steady way to help shape public policies.</p>
            <p>Cai Qiye, who is the chairman of the Taiwan EDU Association, suggested that the Youth Basic Law should also protect younger students, people with disabilities, and young people in different situations. This would make sure that many different ideas are heard. For mental health, he said that support for youth mental health services and research should be made into law. This would stop policies from ending when new political parties take power.</p>

            <h1>Zhubei New Lotus Park Project Starts, Will Have an 18-meter Long Slide</h1>
            <p>The Zhubei City Office in Hsinchu County announced today that they will build a new Lotus Park. It will have a long slide, 18 meters in length. The park will be designed to fit the natural land and trees, keeping healthy trees. They will also make the park feel more open and clear. Paths will connect different parts of the park, making it easy for people to walk around.</p>
            <p>Today, the Zhubei City Office held a ceremony to start the Lotus Park improvement project. Zhubei City Mayor Zheng Chaofang said that the old Lotus Park had facilities that were old and broken. Also, there were too many trees, which made the park dark and led to more mosquitoes. Some paths were wet for a long time and had moss, making it easy for people to slip and fall.</p>
            <p>He said that the City Office has put aside 20 million New Taiwan Dollars for these improvements. They will build an 18-meter-long slide, which will be the longest in Hsinchu County. The design will focus on blending with nature, fitting the land and trees. They will also add paths to connect the park, so people can feel the breeze moving through the natural space.</p>
            <p>Zheng Chaofang explained that the new Lotus Park will have a "landscape play area." This area will use the hills to create fun play spaces for children and parents at different heights. It will have the slide, with natural wood chips below it to make it safe. There will also be climbing nets and a high place to look out from. This will let children explore nature and use their senses while they play.</p>
            <p>He said the new Lotus Park is in the western part of Zhubei. It is close to the popular Lotus Temple and the Fengqi Trail. The Fengqi Trail will also get a new look in the future; its design is being worked on now. After the park opens, it will join the temple and the trail to become a tourist spot that mixes nature and culture.</p>
