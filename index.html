New reports are highlighting a significant issue: the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses a huge amount of energy. This energy demand is mainly from the powerful computer systems and data centers needed to train and run AI models. Experts compare the electricity usage of these systems to that of small countries. This situation is leading to worries about the environment, especially about carbon emissions and the world's ability to produce enough clean energy. As AI technology becomes more common in daily life and business, the need for sustainable energy solutions is becoming a top priority for tech companies and governments alike. Many believe that if AI continues to grow at this rate, it will be essential to find greener ways to power it to avoid a major environmental impact.

**Cities Around the World Prepare for More Extreme Heat**

With global temperatures rising, cities across the world are getting ready for longer and more intense heatwaves. These extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and dangerous for people, especially the elderly and those without air conditioning. City planners are now looking for new ways to protect residents and keep urban areas cool. Solutions include planting more trees and creating green spaces, which can naturally lower temperatures. Cities are also setting up "cooling centers" where people can go to escape the heat and are redesigning buildings to reflect sunlight. This preparation is a big change for many cities that are not used to such high temperatures, showing how daily life is adapting to climate change.

**The Four-Day Workweek Gains Momentum Globally**

A new way of working, the four-day workweek, is becoming more popular around the world. In this model, employees work four days instead of five but still get paid the same amount. Recent trials in various countries have shown promising results. Companies participating in these trials often report that employees are happier, less stressed, and even more productive. This is because people have more time for personal life, hobbies, or family, leading to better well-being. While it doesn't work for every industry, many businesses are seeing benefits, and the idea is spreading quickly. It suggests a possible future for work that could change daily routines for millions of people.`;
