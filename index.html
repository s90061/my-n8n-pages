            <h1>Trump 2.0 Manufacturing Revival: Global Central Interprets the New American Dream</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, August 1) After taking office, US President Trump promised a "manufacturing-based" competition plan. He wants to bring manufacturing back to the US, making it a "national honor." The August issue of "Global Central" magazine's cover story, "Trump's American Dream," explores how Trump plans to restart manufacturing and the problems he faces. It also looks at conservative ideas in American society and how Taiwan, the EU, and China see the American Dream.</p>
            <p>"The American Dream is starting again. It will be stronger and cannot be stopped," said Trump, 79, when he spoke to Congress again in March. He told the world that America's golden age was about to begin.</p>
            <p>After he became president, he signed many executive orders. He promised to use high taxes to help American factories. He wants to bring manufacturing back as a "national honor." The goals are to create jobs, make supply chains shorter, and make the country more independent in terms of money and business.</p>
            <p>China makes 230 times more ships each year than the US. Because of this big difference, Trump also dreams of rebuilding the shipbuilding industry in the US. But for America to bring back manufacturing, it needs to solve three main problems: not enough skilled workers, weak technology, and complex supply chains.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI), and Trump's global trade war have also changed the job market in the US. More young Americans are now interested in working for family businesses. Also, young people are starting to like blue-collar jobs more.</p>
            <p>Trump's popular conservative ideas have also caused society to move towards the right. Young men from Generation Z strongly supported Trump's return to the White House. On social media, there is also a new trend of "traditional housewives."</p>
            <p>However, Trump's government had strict rules about immigration. They cut funding for research in universities and made it harder for international students to get visas. This caused talented people to leave and made university campuses feel tense. It seemed that America was no longer a place where people from all countries could come to follow their dreams.</p>

            <h1>US Says Taiwan's Longma Precision Machinery, Joemars Electric Helped Iran's Drones; Will Sanction</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 31) Today, the US State Department named companies and people in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. They are involved in buying technology and equipment to help Iran's drone program. The US will put sanctions on them. According to a statement from the US Department of the Treasury, the Taiwanese companies that will be sanctioned are Longma Precision Machinery Co. and Joemars Machinery and Electric Industrial Co. Both are in Taichung.</p>
            <p>The US State Department released a statement this afternoon. It said that for the reasons mentioned, the US today is sanctioning five companies and one person. These are located in Iran, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>This action is to follow "National Security Presidential Memorandum-2," signed by President Trump. This memorandum aims to stop Iran from actively making missiles and other special and regular weapons.</p>
            <p>The State Department said the US will use all possible ways, including sanctioning companies in other countries. They want to find and stop Iran's attempts to buy equipment and materials for its drone program. This program makes the Middle East and wider areas unstable.</p>
            <p>According to a statement from the US Department of the Treasury, Iran's Control Afzar company bought CNC machines and equipment for Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company (HESA), which is controlled by Iran's Ministry of Defense.</p>
            <p>CNC machines are used for making high-level aerospace and defense products. They can make exact and strong parts for planes used by businesses and the military.</p>
            <p>The Treasury Department said that Control Afzar used Mecatron Machinery Co Ltd and Joemars Machinery and Electric Industrial Co Ltd to send CNC machines and equipment to Iran. They did this knowing it was against sanctions and export rules.</p>
            <p>Joemars Machinery and Electric Industrial Co Ltd also has a smaller company in China called "Changzhou Joemars Industrial Automation Co Ltd."</p>
            <p>According to Joemars' website, Joemars started in 1989. Its products include wire-cutting electrical discharge machines and high-speed small-hole electrical discharge machines. Longma's website says it has 30 years of experience in making machine tools, selling them, and all technical operations.</p>
            <p>The US Department of the Treasury said that all money and property in the US owned or controlled by these five companies and individuals are now frozen. Accounts of companies they directly or indirectly control (50% or more ownership) are also frozen.</p>
            <p>Unless they get permission from the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) or it is an allowed situation, OFAC rules generally stop Americans or people in the US from doing business with the frozen money or property of sanctioned individuals.</p>
            <p>Also, during transit through the US, no related transactions are allowed.</p>
            <p>According to the Treasury Department's statement, breaking US sanctions can lead to financial or criminal penalties for people in the US and other countries. Also, financial companies and others might be sanctioned if they are part of certain deals or activities with sanctioned people.</p>
