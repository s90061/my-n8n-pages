            <h1>KPMG Survey: Global Venture Capital in Q2 Focuses on Innovation, AI Interest Remains Strong</h1>
            <p>KPMG announced today that despite big global economic and political problems, the venture capital market in the second quarter of 2025 stayed strong. This was true for important areas like artificial intelligence (AI), defense, and space technology. This shows that investors are very hopeful about future technology and have smart plans.</p>
            <p>Today, KPMG released its "Q2 2025 Venture Pulse: Global Venture Capital Analysis" report. It talks about the chances, problems, and investment trends for new companies around the world and in key regions.</p>
            <p>Huang Hai-ning, who leads KPMG's Innovation and Startup Services, said that the global venture capital market faced big difficulties in the second quarter of 2025. Especially, the "Liberation Day" tariff policy from the US on April 2nd greatly affected world trade and supply chains. But venture capital firms were clever. They focused more on new areas that have high growth potential and are less affected by trade risks.</p>
            <p>The report shows that in the second quarter of 2025, there were 7,356 venture capital deals, raising $101 billion. This is less than the $128.4 billion raised in the first quarter of 2025. The main reason for this difference is a very large $40 billion deal with OpenAI in Q1. If we don't count that special deal, venture capital activity in Q2 was still quite strong. This shows that investors are still very interested in artificial intelligence, defense technology, and space technology.</p>
            <p>KPMG said that the Americas had a strong venture capital performance in Q2. They raised $72.7 billion and completed 3,425 deals. Investment activity remained strong, especially in artificial intelligence, defense technology, and space technology. The United States alone accounted for $70 billion of the total investment in the Americas, which is almost 70% of the total global venture capital.</p>
            <p>KPMG gave examples of how artificial intelligence continues to drive global venture capital. The US attracted some of the biggest deals in this field. These include AI startup Scale AI raising $14.3 billion, AI defense technology startup Anduril Industries raising $2.5 billion, AI development startup Safe Superintelligence raising $2 billion, AI startup Thinking Machines Lab raising a $2 billion seed round, and Anysphere, an AI programming assistant startup, raising $900 million.</p>
            <p>For other regions, KPMG said that in Europe, the 1,733 deals and $14.6 billion in Q2 2025 were a small decrease from Q1's 2,358 deals and $16.3 billion. Asia is still at a very low point, with 2,022 deals and $12.8 billion in Q2. The number of deals in Asia went down by about 24% compared to Q1, but the total investment amount increased slightly by 1.59%. This is mainly because China's economy is slowing down, which led to China's venture capital investments being the worst in 10 years.</p>
            <p>KPMG believes that for the third quarter of 2025, the total global venture capital investment will likely stay low. This is mainly because of the uncertain US tariff policies, which will make venture capitalists cautious. Artificial intelligence is still expected to be a popular area for venture capital, with more specific solutions becoming popular. Defense technology, medical technology, and financial technology will also get steady investments. However, venture capitalists might be more careful about industries that could be affected by changes in US tariff policies until these policies become clear.</p>
            <p>KPMG also added that a new trend in Q2 2025 for venture capital funds is to make their fund lives longer. Because there is so much uncertainty globally and not enough easy money, this helps investors avoid having to sell investments at bad times. It also gives new companies more time to grow.</p>
            <p>KPMG stated that venture capitalists also want to be more involved in the operations of the companies they invest in. This means they are moving from just investing money to actively helping companies find changes and increase their value. This trend is especially important for established funds. Extending the life of a fund gives investors more peace of mind.</p>

            <h1>Trump Hopes TSMC Will Invest More; Liu Jing-ching: Key Technologies Will Be Protected</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump has announced a 100% tariff on chips. But if companies promise to build factories in the US or are already building them, "there will be no tariffs." Right now, people think this is good news for TSMC. However, some lawmakers are worried. They fear that Trump's repeated pressure on TSMC to invest more in the US might make Taiwan lose its advantage in the industry. But Liu Jing-ching, who is the head of the National Development Council and also a director at TSMC, clearly stated, "Our key technologies will be protected."</p>
            <p>Today, Liu Jing-ching went to the Legislative Yuan's Economic Committee. He was there to talk about "Taiwan's future economic situation and new plans for industrial global layout after the US's equal tariffs are finalized." Lawmakers from both sides of the government asked about Trump's announcement today of a 100% chip tariff and issues about TSMC's investments.</p>
            <p>Lawmaker Chang Chi-kai from the Taiwan People's Party was worried that a 100% chip tariff would make the semiconductor supply chain move faster to the United States. Lawmaker Hsieh Yi-feng from the Kuomintang was concerned about how to keep TSMC's advantages in Taiwan, as the US wants TSMC to invest more.</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching said, first, when the government checks new plans, it will not let key and newest technologies leave Taiwan first. TSMC's advanced 1.4-nanometer and 2-nanometer processes are still in Taiwan. So, key technologies will be kept safe. Second, most of TSMC's more than 10,000 research and development staff are in Taiwan. Third, TSMC's main leadership team and main office are also in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Because of these three points, Liu Jing-ching believes that TSMC's advantage "will definitely be protected."</p>
            <p>Regarding investments, Liu Jing-ching said that TSMC is building new factories in Kaohsiung and Chiayi, and also plans to build a new factory in Taichung. He said, "TSMC's investments in Taiwan are much more than its investments in the United States."</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching also said that every company invests when they have orders. Looking at TSMC's production ability and factory plans, TSMC's investment in the US "is not moving out, it's expanding."</p>

            <h1>Analysis: Trump Sanctions India Over Russian Oil; US-India Alliance Against China Faces Changes</h1>
            <p>Washington (CNA) â€“ Today, US President Donald Trump put more pressure on India for buying Russian oil. He raised tariffs on Indian goods going to the US to 50%. Some experts say this action makes it harder to get India to work with the US against China. Also, if India stops buying Russian oil right away, global oil prices could go up very high.</p>
            <p>Last week, when Trump decided on equal tariffs, he set India's rate at 25%. Now, he added another 25% because he says India is "helping" Russia's war efforts. This makes the total tariff rate on Indian goods going to the US 50%.</p>
            <p>CNBC, an American financial news website, pointed out that the US had encouraged India to buy Russian crude oil before. Unlike liquefied natural gas (LNG), Russian crude oil was not banned by sanctions, but it had a price limit. Data from Kpler, a global trade data and analysis company, shows that Russia exports about 3.35 million barrels of crude oil every day. India buys about 1.7 million barrels of this, and China buys 1.1 million barrels.</p>
            <p>Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy advisor in the Bush administration, told CNBC that Indian authorities must feel very confused now.</p>
            <p>McNally said, "After Russia invaded Ukraine, [then-US President] Biden went to India and asked them to buy Russian oil. At that time, India was hardly importing any Russian oil. The US asked India, 'Please buy this oil' to keep oil prices low, and India did. Now, we are asking them why they are buying so much Russian oil."</p>
            <p>An Indian oil industry person told CNBC that if India stops buying Russian crude oil today, "global crude oil prices could go over $200 per barrel, and consumers everywhere would suffer."</p>
            <p>The Indian oil industry person said that when the US doesn't want India to buy something, it says so directly. For example, when India bought oil from Iran before, it stopped importing Iranian oil to follow Washington's sanctions. Now, India is being sanctioned by the US.</p>
            <p>Sara Vakhshouri, who started and leads the global energy strategy consulting company SVB International Energy (SVBEI), told CNBC that Trump's heavy tariffs on India are probably a "negotiation tactic." The goal is to get back the share of the oil market that the US lost in India since 2022 and to make up for less exports. At the same time, it aims to make sure more US goods can enter India.</p>
            <p>Vakhshouri said, "India has always worked closely with the US on oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil. However, for the Trump administration, energy security, affordable prices, and steady supply are the main things they care about."</p>
            <p>Experts say that Trump's strong tariffs on India mean that the relationship between the US and India, which is an important partner for safety and defense, might get worse.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post said that during President Biden's time, the US government was more understanding about India's economy than about other countries that kept ties with Russia. At the same time, the US and India also worked closely in some parts of Asia to fight against China's power.</p>
            <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the first foreign leaders to meet Trump after he returned to office. At that time, they announced plans for new defense and energy cooperation. In June this year, Trump accepted Modi's invitation to attend the Quad Leaders' Summit, hosted by India later this year, which includes the US, Japan, India, and Australia. It remains to be seen if this plan will change.</p>
            <p>Recently, Trump has started to build stronger relationships with Pakistan, a main rival of India. He even tried to help solve the long-standing Kashmir dispute between the two countries through social media.</p>
            <p>The New York Times said that part of the US's plan to be friends with India is based on the safety situation in Asia. However, India's appeal for a partnership with the US also comes from its economic potential.</p>
            <p>Companies like Apple have invested billions of dollars in India. In 2023, India's population became larger than China's. This made foreign investors interested in India's big local market and its potential to become another world factory. US investments in India are not just for making money, but also to lessen or even stop relying on China.</p>
            <p>However, even the 25% equal tariff rate made India lose out to other Asian competitors with lower tariffs, such as Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea, weakening its trade advantage. If the tariff rises to 50%, the US's hope of building supply chains with India will completely fail.</p>
            <p>Besides the reason of buying Russian oil, on August 5th, Trump also pointed to India's purposefully developed pharmaceutical industry. India has a strong advantage in making medicines globally, with over $10 billion in related exports to the US each year. But Trump is planning to put a special tariff of up to 250% on medicines sold to the US, saying he will announce it in about a week.</p>
            <p>Currently, almost 40% of generic medicines sold in the US are made in India. Eli Lilly, an American drug company, recently invested $3 billion to build a factory in India, and it will also be affected.</p>
            <p>The New York Times said that by threatening tariffs as high as 50%, Trump seems to be giving up on the US's original policy to support India as a key strategic point against China. At least, it will be harder to expect India to work more with the US on China-related issues.</p>
            <p>Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official who now works at the "Global Trade Research Initiative" (GTRI) in New Delhi, said that this action by the US will make India "rethink its strategic position, and it might further strengthen its relationships with Russia, China, and other countries."</p>
