            <h1>No More Money for Home Loans? Financial Regulator Talks to Banks and Stops Forced Sales</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) met with eight big state-owned banks today. They talked about two main things: how much money banks can lend for home loans, and if banks are making people buy home loan insurance. The FSC explained that banks can lend up to 30% of their total deposits and money from selling bonds for real estate. Banks cannot say they have no more money to lend just because they have their own lower limits, like 28.5%. Banks can also get more deposits to lend more money. The FSC also strictly said that banks must not force people to buy insurance with their home loan.</p>
            <p>There is a rule for banks called "Article 72-2 of the Banking Act." It says that banks cannot lend more than 30% of their total deposits and money from selling financial bonds for home building and business building loans. This rule is to stop banks from taking too many risks.</p>
            <p>The FSC looked at numbers and saw that in July, the average amount of money 36 local banks lent for real estate was 26.04%. This was a little less than 26.31% in June. But people in the market were still saying that banks had no more money to lend. So, the FSC met with the eight state-owned banks this morning to understand the real situation.</p>
            <p>An FSC officer said that the meeting focused on two main things. First, the amount of money for home loans. Second, if home loan insurance was being sold with home loans. They did not talk much about the central bank's rules on how much money can be lent for real estate, as that is the central bank's job.</p>
            <p>For home loan limits, the officer explained that the law allows up to 30%. But banks might set their own goals, like 28.5%. The FSC told banks that it is okay to have their own risk rules. But banks cannot use these rules to say they have no more money to lend. The law says there is still money to lend. Their own rules should not stop them from lending. Banks also need to tell their branches this, so they don't refuse loans because of these internal rules.</p>
            <p>The FSC also noted that some news reports said banks were making people buy home loan insurance. The FSC said that home loan insurance is a good product that helps customers if something bad happens, like not being able to pay back the loan. But the problem is when banks sell it. If banks offer the insurance when people are signing the loan contract, customers might feel they have to buy it. They might worry they won't get the home loan if they don't. Or, if banks talk about insurance at meetings for new loans, they should be careful. The FSC said banks need to think about how they sell these products.</p>
            <p>An FSC officer said that in the meeting, they told banks not to force customers to buy things. They must be careful about when they offer products. This is to avoid people misunderstanding.</p>
            <p>The state-owned banks said they have to give many loans that are part of government plans, like the "New Youth Loan." This makes their loan amounts look high. The FSC explained that it is true that state-owned banks give these policy loans. But the law allows 30%. If they cannot change the amount they lend, they can try to get more deposits from branches. Right now, there is enough money in the market, so banks can adjust by taking in more deposits.</p>
            <p>The FSC said that the banks did not ask for the rules to be changed during the meeting. The meeting was mostly for sharing ideas.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei Man Sells Protected "Shark Sword" Online; Buyers Also Accused</h1>
            <p>In New Taipei, a man named Mr. Chen sold a "shark sword" online. This "shark sword" is made from a sawfish, which is a protected animal. He made almost NT$30,000. The police have accused Mr. Chen, the person who bought it, and another person who helped with the sale. They are all accused of breaking the Wildlife Conservation Act.</p>
            <p>According to the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office, Mr. Chen bought the sawfish nose part (called a "shark sword") in January for NT$18,250. He kept it in a scooter shop in Yonghe District, New Taipei. Then, he put pictures and information about the "shark sword" on a Facebook group for selling religious items.</p>
            <p>In March, a man named Mr. Huang contacted Mr. Chen, the seller, through another person (an intermediary). They agreed that Mr. Huang would buy the "shark sword" for NT$28,000. They met at the scooter shop in Yonghe to exchange the item. Investigators from the Marine Conservation Agency's special task force found out about this sale. On April 22, they went to search, but they did not find the "shark sword" at first. That afternoon, Mr. Huang gave the "shark sword" to the investigators himself.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor's office said that Mr. Chen (the seller), Mr. Huang (the buyer), and the intermediary are all involved. They are accused of breaking the Wildlife Conservation Act. This means illegally selling and buying products from protected wild animals. They are also accused of helping others commit a crime. The office has officially accused all three. They also asked the court to take the NT$28,000 that was made from selling the "shark sword" as illegal money.</p>
            <p>"Shark swords" are often used in folk religions by spirit mediums. The Marine Conservation Agency website says that "shark swords" are made from the nose part of a "sawfish." Sawfish usually live in warm, shallow seas. Their long nose is sometimes seen as a valuable item to collect or use in old medicines. Taiwan made all kinds of sawfish protected wild animals in 2008. In 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature also listed sawfish as a species in danger of disappearing.</p>
            <p>The Wildlife Conservation Act says that if you buy or sell protected wild animals or their products, or show them to sell them, without permission from the government, you can go to jail. The punishment is from 6 months to 5 years in prison. You can also get a fine from NT$300,000 to NT$1,500,000.</p>

            <h1>New Person Represents National Development Council on TSMC Board</h1>
            <p>Today, the National Development Council (NDC) held a ceremony for its new and old leaders. Mr. Yeh Jiunn-shiann officially started as the new head of the NDC. Because the leader changed, the person who represents the NDC on TSMC's board of directors also changed. Mr. Yeh Jiunn-shiann is now this new representative.</p>
            <p>The National Development Fund, which is managed by the Cabinet, owns a lot of shares in TSMC. It has 1,653,700,000 shares, which is more than 6% of the company. This makes it the biggest shareholder that is a company. Based on TSMC's closing price of NT$1165 today, these shares are worth about NT$1.92 trillion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Liu Ching-chung, who was the head of the NDC before, used to be the person who represented the NDC on TSMC's board. Now that the NDC leader has changed, Mr. Liu Ching-chung has left, and Mr. Yeh Jiunn-shiann has taken his place. So, the person who represents the NDC on TSMC's board has also changed to Mr. Yeh Jiunn-shiann.</p>
            <p>TSMC also announced today that its cash dividend per share for the first quarter of 2025 has changed a tiny bit. It went from NT$5 to NT$5.00001754. This happened because the company bought back some restricted shares that employees had. The day without the dividend will be September 16. People will not be able to transfer their regular shares from September 18 to September 22. The dividends will be paid on October 9.</p>
