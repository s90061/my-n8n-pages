            <h1>Rally in Support of 5 KMT Legislators in Taipei; Huang Kuo-chang: Use Votes on July 26 to Teach Lai Ching-teh a Lesson</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party held a meeting today in front of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) headquarters. This meeting was to support five Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in Taipei who might be removed from office. Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party, said that on July 26, people should vote "disagree" to the removal. He said this vote would tell President Lai Ching-teh that the people are in charge of the country. He also said it would be a way to remind the DPP and teach Lai Ching-teh a lesson.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party held the event called "Democracy Uprising! Anti-Recall to Win, Taiwan to Win" this afternoon. Eight lawmakers from the Taiwan People's Party joined. Also, KMT lawmakers from Taipei, like Lai Shih-bao, Li Yan-hsiu, Wang Hong-wei, Hsu Chiao-hsin, and Luo Zhi-qiang, were there.</p>
            <p>Chen Peiqi, who is the wife of Ko Wen-je, the former leader of the Taiwan People's Party, spoke at the event. She said this was her first time speaking in public against a big recall. She explained that in a democracy, it is normal for opposition parties to watch over the party in power. She believes that if lawmakers from the opposition are removed just because their decisions do not agree with the ruling party, it is like "green communism" or a government that only one person controls. This is why she strongly supports stopping the recall.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen Peiqi hopes that more people will tell others to vote "no" to the recall on July 26. She said she will vote, and she hopes her husband will go with her to Jin'ou Business High School to vote against the recall. She will also ask a lawyer to help Ko Wen-je get his right to vote.</p>
            <p>Lai Shih-bao said that in most countries, the party in power does not try to remove all opposition lawmakers. He said only Taiwan does this. He believes it is because the DPP has fewer seats and loses votes often. He stated that July 26 is not just about the recall election, but it is a fight between democracy and a government that controls everything.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-wei said that when opposition parties work together, they can watch the government better. She thanked the Taiwan People's Party and KMT for working closely to stand against a government that has too much power. She said this big recall is not about democracy but about fighting. On July 26, she asked everyone to vote "disagree" to the recall. This would teach the DPP and Lai Ching-teh a lesson and make the DPP lose again.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chiao-hsin said that the hard work of the KMT and the Taiwan People's Party over the past year must not be lost. She noted that the big recall is against KMT lawmakers. She added that "little grass" (supporters of the Taiwan People's Party) could just watch, but they chose to stand up for their shared political beliefs. She thanked everyone for their kindness, saying she would never forget it.</p>
            <p>Luo Zhi-qiang then spoke to the people there. He asked if they would let Ko Wen-je vote and help protect his right to vote. He also questioned how much the "bad government" wants to hurt Ko Wen-je. Li Yan-hsiu said that everyone must stand up to show the DPP that Taiwan's democracy is not controlled by them. She asked people to vote on July 26 to say "no" to Lai Ching-teh, because the people are the real leaders.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang spoke last. He asked why President Lai treats people who do not agree with the DPP as "unimportant." He warned that Lai should not think his bodyguards can protect him from this question. He added that as long as Lai is the President, people have the right to ask him to explain why they are seen as "unimportant."</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said this recall is not just about one lawmaker. He believes this "big bad recall" is meant to tell the people of Taiwan that the DPP does not want anyone to watch over them. He thinks the DPP wants only their voice to be heard in Taiwan. He warned that if Lai Ching-teh succeeds, Taiwan will become something everyone dislikes. He stressed that protecting Taiwan's democracy means protecting the future for the next generation.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that political parties can compete, criticize, and talk about ideas. But he stressed that Taiwan is a democratic country, and the party in power must not be allowed to harm the country. He asked people to vote "disagree" on July 26. He said this would tell Lai Ching-teh that the people are the owners of the country and would remind and teach the DPP and Lai Ching-teh a lesson.</p>

            <h1>If LDP Loses in Japan's Upper House Election, Shigeru Ishiba May Be Forced Out</h1>
            <p>Japan is holding its 27th House of Councillors election today, with voting and counting of votes. The final results should be clear by late tonight. A key question is whether the ruling parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito (together called "LDP-Komeito"), can keep more than half of the seats in the House of Councillors. After the votes are counted, Japanese news says the LDP might lose, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba might have to step down. This election for the Upper House will be a big change for Japanese politics.</p>
            <p>Voting for Japan's Upper House election ended tonight at 8 PM (7 PM in Taipei). Counting votes started right away. It is important to see if the LDP and Komeito can win 50 seats, because they do not have a lot of power in the House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>Around 8 PM tonight, top officials from the LDP, like Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama and Election Strategy Committee Chairman Seiji Kihara, came to the LDP headquarters. Their faces looked serious.</p>
            <p>NHK news reported that the LDP is expected to win only 27 to 41 seats this time. A person who used to be a government minister told NHK, "If the LDP and Komeito cannot keep more than half of the seats in the House of Councillors, Prime Minister and LDP leader Shigeru Ishiba should leave his job." This is because it would be their third loss, after the House of Representatives election last autumn and the Tokyo city assembly election this summer.</p>
            <p>The Japanese House of Councillors has 248 seats in total. Lawmakers in this house serve for 6 years. Every 3 years, half of the seats (124) are voted on again. This election will choose 125 lawmakers. This includes 74 seats from different areas, 50 seats based on the total votes for parties, and 1 extra seat from a special election in Tokyo.</p>
            <p>The LDP already has 62 seats that are not being voted on in this election, and Komeito has 13 seats. Together, they have 75 seats. So, if the LDP and Komeito win 50 seats in this Upper House election, they will keep more than half of the seats in the House of Councillors. Before this election, the LDP and Komeito had 66 seats. Even if they lose 16 seats in this election, they can still keep their majority.</p>
            <p>The LDP and Komeito have only failed to win 50 seats in an Upper House election one time since the year 2000. This happened in 2007, when the ruling party lost badly during the first time Shinzo Abe was Prime Minister.</p>

            <h1>Executive Yuan: Money Left Over is Not "Over-collected Tax"; Local Leaders Should Not Confuse People</h1>
            <p>Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said that the central government collected more money than expected last year, over 520 billion New Taiwan Dollars (NTD). He believes this money should be given to people quickly, around 10,000 NTD for each person. But Lee Hui-chih, who speaks for the Executive Yuan, said that local leaders know about the Public Debt Act. She said they understand there is no "over-collected tax." She also stated that when the government collects more money than planned, it does not mean there is a lot of "final money left over." She hopes local leaders will not confuse people.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai was asked if the government would give 10,000 NTD in cash to everyone. He said earlier that if they did this, they would need to borrow about 101.4 billion NTD. He said this decision was difficult for him.</p>
            <p>News reports said that Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an mentioned today that the central government collected over 520 billion NTD more than expected last year, and 1.8 trillion NTD more over four years. He hopes the government will give 10,000 NTD to people soon, as the law says. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen also said that the central government collected 528.3 billion NTD more in taxes last year. She thinks that even after giving 10,000 NTD to everyone, there would still be over 200 billion NTD left. However, Premier Cho Jung-tai said there was only a bit over 30 billion NTD left from the extra tax collected. Mayor Lu questioned where the rest of the money went.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih released a statement today saying that she believes local leaders should understand the financial reports. She said that the "over 500 billion NTD" of money collected more than planned for the year 113 (which is 2024) is a number for the whole country, including both the central and local governments. By law, local governments will receive over 70 billion NTD. Also, money must be put into different funds. The central government actually has only 375.7 billion NTD.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih explained that from that 375.7 billion NTD, over 190 billion NTD must first be used to pay back debts. This is required by Article 12 of the Public Debt Act and other rules. So, the money left over for the year 113 is expected to be only 164.1 billion NTD. This money is already part of the central government's total money saved, which is 443.6 billion NTD. The Executive Yuan's special plan to make things safer and stronger plans to use 410 billion NTD from this saved money.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih said that local leaders have many years of experience leading cities. They should know about the Public Debt Act and other important rules. They should also understand that there is no "over-collection" of tax. And she said that just because more money was collected than planned, it does not mean that is the "final amount of money left over." She hopes local leaders will not continue to mislead people and cause confusion.</p>
