            <h1>Taichung City Government approves drainage improvement project between Hungkuang and Providence Universities</h1>
            <p>In the coastal area of Taichung City, heavy rains used to cause big floods. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that between Hungkuang University and Providence University, scooters often fell over because of the strong water. The city government has set aside 150 million NT dollars to fix this problem. They also got another 18 million NT dollars. The work should finish by the end of the year.</p>
            <p>The Taichung branch of the Ministry of Agriculture's Rural Development and Soil and Water Conservation Agency has approved a project for Taichung City Government. This project is called "Road Improvement and Drainage Management Project around Providence University and Hungkuang University Campuses in Shalu District, Taichung City â€“ Drainage Improvement from Hungkuang University to Beitun River." For this project, the central government will give 9 million NT dollars, and the local government will give another 9 million NT dollars, making a total of 18 million NT dollars. The city government approved paying for this first today in a city meeting. This plan will then go to the Taichung City Council for approval.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu Shiow-yen explained that even though there are drainage pipes between Hungkuang and Providence, the water flows very fast during heavy rains because of the land's shape. People and scooters often get pushed over by the water. This problem has not been fixed for decades. She believes new building methods can solve it. They are using new methods and finding money. They spent 150 million NT dollars for just 1.5 kilometers to solve the flood problem.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said the part near Hungkuang is already finished. Now they are working on the part near Providence, and it should be done by the end of the year. Recently, during Typhoon Danas and heavy rains, the project was tested. They saw that even with a lot of rain, the fast water flow was much better. They still needed to find enough money for the project.</p>
            <p>Chen Ta-tien, the head of Taichung City's Construction Bureau, explained that the coastal area often suffers from floods. Especially with the strange weather recently, from Hungkuang University to Providence University, when it rained heavily, students' scooters often fell over, or roads turned into "floating rivers." Mayor Lu Shiow-yen cares a lot about flood control. Many years ago, she made a plan. Starting last year, they spent 150 million NT dollars on a 1.5-kilometer section from Hungkuang to Providence to improve drainage and pedestrian paths.</p>
            <p>Chen Ta-tien said that they recently received 18 million NT dollars from the Soil and Water Conservation Agency. The central and local governments each paid 9 million NT dollars. This money is for making the drainage pipes bigger between Hungkuang University and Beitun River. During this year's Typhoon Danas and heavy rains, the water flowed well. Students' safety when going to school and traveling was ensured. The whole project will finish by the end of the year. The money they got this time will be used to improve small connecting pipes and sidewalks, solving the drainage problems for both universities at once.</p>

            <h1>China again claims Taiwan's legal status; Ministry of Foreign Affairs says lies repeated a thousand times won't become true</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said again that Taiwan has always been a part of China, both in history and law, and this cannot be doubted. Today, the spokesperson for Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hsiao Kuang-wei, said that China's lies, even if said a thousand times, will not become true. It is a clear fact that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are separate and do not belong to each other. The People's Republic of China also has no right to speak for Taiwan in the world.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung recently strongly disagreed with what China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. Lin stressed that after the war, the "Treaty of San Francisco" replaced political statements like the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation." This treaty did not give Taiwan to the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan. In response, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning said on August 18th that this idea was wrong. She claimed again that Taiwan is historically and legally a part of China and this cannot be questioned.</p>
            <p>In a regular press conference this morning, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hsiao Kuang-wei stated that the Chinese Communist Party's lies will not become true, even if they say them a thousand times. The current situation in the Indo-Pacific area is very difficult. Especially in recent years, China has often challenged the "international order based on rules." This has badly damaged democracy, the rule of law, human rights, freedom, and even fair trade. This has made other countries aware of the problem. More and more countries are showing they care about safety and peace in the Indo-Pacific area by sending warships through the Taiwan Strait, showing it is international water.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei also said that China has put pressure on Taiwan for a long time in international places. They use legal tools like the "Anti-Secession Law" and "22 measures to punish independence." At the same time, they wrongly change the meaning of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. They try to use this resolution to say they can attack Taiwan by force and stop Taiwan from being involved in international events. Based on this, they make wrong claims like "Taiwan is a part of China" and "the Taiwan Strait is China's inner sea." China's claims clearly go against facts and democratic values. Many countries' parliaments or governments have also spoken out, clearly disagreeing with China's wrong explanations.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei repeated what Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said earlier. He stressed that Taiwan started to become more politically free and democratic from the mid-1980s, with people at all levels pushing for it. In 1996, Taiwan held its first direct presidential election. The central government's leaders and lawmakers in the Republic of China are chosen by the people of Taiwan. From that time, this government has effectively ruled and is the only legal government that speaks for Taiwan to other countries. This also made it clear that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China exist equally and do not control each other.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei said that since then, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has seen three changes in ruling parties. This has made Taiwan's democracy and sense of self stronger. It also shows the strong belief and will of the Taiwanese people to seek freedom and democracy.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei repeated again that it is a clear fact that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are separate and do not belong to each other. The People's Republic of China has no right to speak for Taiwan in the world. He asked the Beijing government to be realistic and understand that relations between the two sides can only get better if they have respectful and equal talks with Taiwan's elected government, which represents its people.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei stated that Taiwan will also stand united with its democratic friends. Together, they will hold up a "democratic umbrella." They will face the challenges of authoritarianism together, protect shared values, and keep the international order based on rules.</p>

            <h1>Chiang Wan-an suggests cabinet formation; T.C. Tung: No comment on presidential powers</h1>
            <p>Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an suggested that President Lai Ching-te should ask Pegatron Chairman T.C. Tung to form a new cabinet. This idea caused much discussion. Today, T.C. Tung said that choosing cabinet members is the President's power given by the Constitution. He will not easily comment or discuss this matter. He added that Premier Cho Jung-tai is currently facing a lot of pressure from both inside and outside the country, and all cabinet members are working very hard.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City branch of the Taiwan People's Party is holding a special exhibition called "Talking About Nuclear Power: The August 23rd Referendum for Extending Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant Operation." It is taking place from August 9th to 22nd at the square outside Exit 6 of Ximen MRT Station. This morning, T.C. Tung visited the exhibition. Professor Li Min from National Tsing Hua University's Institute of Nuclear Engineering and Science guided him. Taiwan People's Party legislator Liu Shu-bin and Taipei City council members Chang Chih-hao, Huang Jing-ying, and Lin Jen-yu went with him.</p>
            <p>Before visiting, T.C. Tung was asked about Chiang Wan-an's suggestion for him to form the cabinet. He said he had already answered this question on August 4th. He repeated that choosing cabinet members is the President's constitutional power, so "I will not easily comment or discuss it." He added that the current cabinet and Premier Cho Jung-tai are working very hard and are under a lot of pressure from both inside and outside. He wanted to show his respect and encouragement to all cabinet members for their hard work.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked again if he would agree to form a cabinet if President Lai invited him, T.C. Tung said that he had also mentioned on August 4th that "I am not good at it."</p>
            <p>Regarding media person Li Cheng-hao's statement that the voter turnout for the August 23rd referendum might only be 5%, T.C. Tung said he had not studied Li Cheng-hao's views. However, he still urged people to go out and vote to support the extension of the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant's operation. He explained that Taiwan needs electricity that is of good quality, has a fair price, and can meet the needs of people's lives and industries.</p>
            <p>The media also asked T.C. Tung if his recent mention of the Japanese anime "Demon Slayer" was related to his thoughts on emotional manipulation in politics.</p>
            <p>T.C. Tung said that after July 26th, he saw politicians emotionally manipulating each other. For example, members of the same party "fought freely among themselves" over issues like women's rights. He felt that from small groups to large political parties and the country, when facing pressure, people should be more logical. They should face problems, understand them, and solve them, instead of emotionally manipulating each other.</p>
            <p>T.C. Tung said, "Comics might seem small, but they hold great lessons." For example, in "Demon Slayer," Nezuko was controlled by magic and turned into a demon. But she did not want to drink blood or eat people; she kept her human feelings. This can show that when people face pressure from outside, they should stick to their original good intentions. Also, Nezuko's brother, Tanjiro, did not give up on her. This kind of family love shows kindness, pity, and trust.</p>
