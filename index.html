The White House announced that President Trump will sign an order to delay new tariffs until August 1st. The original date was July 9th.

Trump sent letters to leaders in Japan and South Korea. He stated that the U.S. will add a 25% tax on goods from these countries, starting August 1st. These were the first letters he sent before the July 9th trade deal deadline.

In April, Trump started a tax plan on many countries, with taxes from 11% to 50%. This made global markets unstable. Then, he paused it for 90 days, only using a 10% tax. Countries used this time to talk with the U.S. to get lower taxes.

**Hsieh Su-wei and Partner Lose in Wimbledon Mixed Doubles Quarter-finals**

Taiwan's tennis star Hsieh Su-wei and her partner Jan Zielinski from Poland lost their match at Wimbledon today. They were playing in the mixed doubles quarter-finals. They lost 6-7, 3-6 to a team from Brazil and the UK. So, they could not win the title again.

Hsieh Su-wei wanted to win her 10th major trophy. She played with Jan Zielinski again in the mixed doubles at Wimbledon. Today, as the defending champions, they played against Luisa Stefani from Brazil and Joe Salisbury from the UK in the quarter-finals. They were trying to get into the semi-finals.

The game was very close in the first set. No team could take a clear lead, so they played a tie-break. Hsieh and Zielinski started slowly but got better. They saved two set points and almost won the first set. But they couldn't keep their lead and lost the set 6-7.

**Trump: 25% Tariffs on Japanese and Korean Imports from August 1**

Today, U.S. President Trump announced new taxes. Starting August 1st, products from Japan and South Korea will have a 25% tax. If goods are sent through another country, the tax will be even higher. If Japan or South Korea add their own taxes on U.S. goods, the U.S. will add the same amount to its 25% tax.

In April, Donald Trump said that most trading partners would pay a 10% tax on imported goods. He also announced higher taxes for some countries, like 24% for Japan and 26% for South Korea. But then he stopped these taxes for a while to allow for talks.

So far, the U.S. has only finished deals with the UK, China, and Vietnam. Cambodia also said it reached a deal. The temporary pause on taxes ends on July 9th. If countries don't make a deal with the U.S. by then, they will start paying higher taxes.
