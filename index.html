            <h1>Taiwanese Actress Song Yun-hua at New York Asian Film Festival for New Movie</h1>
            <p>Actress Song Yun-hua and Korean director Park Sang-min were at the New York Asian Film Festival today. Song Yun-hua is the main actress in the movie "The Home Nobody Knows." She said she practiced Korean hard because she liked the script, and she felt it was a movie with deep meaning. Also, Lai Yu-tung, the producer of the popular teen comedy "Only Sick People Will Like You," was there to promote new Taiwanese actors.</p>
            <p>"The Home Nobody Knows" had its first showing at the New York Asian Film Festival on July 20th. Song Yun-hua and director Park Sang-min attended a party at Film at Lincoln Center.</p>
            <p>"The Home Nobody Knows" is based on a Spanish movie called "The Invisible Guest." The Korean team changed the story to be in Asia. It tells a strange story about a killer's son and his family escaping to Taiwan. The movie was filmed in both Taiwan and Korea. Song Yun-hua learned Korean for her role.</p>
            <p>Song Yun-hua said the script interested her. She likes watching these kinds of movies. When she read the script, she could imagine it would be very entertaining and also a movie with deep meaning.</p>
            <p>She said her biggest challenge was not knowing Korean. She spent six months practicing from basic sounds (vowels and consonants) until she could say her lines and act well. This was probably the hardest part.</p>
            <p>Thinking about filming in two places, Song Yun-hua said this was her first Korean project. She was nervous at first because of the language. She needed a translator to talk with the director and other actors. But once she joined the film crew, everyone was very welcoming. She felt like she was part of a big family, and it was a wonderful experience.</p>
            <p>Recently, the romantic comedy "Only Sick People Will Like You" has been shown in many Asian countries. The producer, Lai Yu-tung, and experienced producer Huang Hsiao-fen were at the party. They hope to bring Taiwanese movies and new actors to a bigger international audience.</p>
            <p>Lai Yu-tung said this movie is about pretending to be sick. He said that when he was young, he often pretended to be sick to avoid school or exams. He wrote this story and asked director Hsu Fu-hsiang to work on it with him.</p>
            <p>"Only Sick People Will Like You" bravely chose new actors, Zhan Huai-yun and Jiang Qi, for the main roles. It's a funny and sad Taiwanese romantic comedy. It's about a boy who pretends to have a serious illness and falls in love with a girl who truly has a serious illness but pretends she doesn't. Many people have liked it recently.</p>
            <p>Lai Yu-tung said finding new actors was very difficult. The production companies and distributors had questions. But he and the director still wanted to find actors who fit the characters well. They believed that these actors had qualities that made them good for the roles, and this was important for the movie to be a success.</p>
            <p>Lai Yu-tung said, "We work with many new actors in Taiwan. They are creative and full of life. We hope to keep helping new Taiwanese actors and give them chances to reach markets outside of Asia."</p>
            <p>"Only Sick People Will Like You" will be shown at the film festival on July 21st.</p>

            <h1>Trump Asks House to Increase Aid for Taiwan to $1 Billion</h1>
            <p>After the Trump government reportedly released $870 million (about 25.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars) in aid for Taiwan that was previously frozen in February, they have spoken about helping Taiwan again. A recent statement from the White House says that the government "strongly asks" the House of Representatives to fully think about the request for $1 billion in aid for Taiwan. This money would help Taiwan have a strong way to protect itself.</p>
            <p>On July 15th, the Office of Management and Budget, which is a big part of the US President's Executive Office, released a policy statement about the Department of Defense spending bill for the 2026 fiscal year. This statement mentioned the "Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative" in the bill.</p>
            <p>The letter said that the executive branch thanked the House Appropriations Committee for including $500 million in the bill for the Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative. This money is very important for helping the Department of Defense make Taiwan's ability to protect itself stronger. The executive branch also strongly asked them to fully consider the request for $1 billion for the Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative in the Department of Defense spending bill for the 2026 fiscal year.</p>
            <p>This is "because Taiwan's strong ability to protect itself is very important for stopping attacks in the Indo-Pacific area. It is also important for keeping American people safe in emergencies."</p>
            <p>However, the bill passed by the House of Representatives on July 18th still only set aside $500 million for the "Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative." This money is to give Taiwan new defense supplies, services, and military education and training. The bill also says that the Secretary of Defense must give a report every three months to the defense committees in Congress about how the money is being used.</p>
            <p>The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party recently told CNA that when they discussed the "Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative" in the bill, they looked at what Mark Montgomery said. He used to be the Director of Operations for the U.S. Pacific Command and gave a testimony in Congress in May this year.</p>
            <p>Retired Major General Montgomery asked Congress at that time to greatly increase military aid to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He wrote that this can be done through "Foreign Military Financing" (FMF), "Presidential Drawdown Authority" (PDA), and the "Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative." Taiwan is too small to deal with Beijing's challenges alone; China's economy is 23 times larger than Taiwan's.</p>
            <p>Montgomery suggested that the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act should create a "Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative" and allow up to $300 million to be given in the first year. For the future, Congress should give $1 billion for this initiative in the 2026 fiscal year and later years.</p>
            <p>"The main use for this money will be to train and teach Taiwanese soldiers. This includes making sure as many of them as possible attend captain-level courses in different military areas. It will also pay for training for military units outside of Taiwan, at places in Hawaii and on the West Coast of the United States."</p>
            <p>Montgomery served in the US Navy for 32 years and retired in 2017. He was the Director of Operations for the U.S. Pacific Command, the commander of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "USS George Washington" battle group, and the Deputy Director for Plans, Policy, and Strategy at the U.S. European Command.</p>
            <p>From 1998 to 2000, he worked at the National Security Council as the Director for Transnational Threats. Montgomery has master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and Oxford University. He also finished the U.S. Navy's nuclear power training program.</p>
            <p>The Department of Defense spending bill passed by the House of Representatives on July 18th is not the final decision yet. This is because the House version still needs to be discussed with the Senate. Only after both houses pass the same version of the bill can it become a law when the President signs it. As of now, the Senate Appropriations Committee has not released its own version of the Department of Defense spending bill.</p>
