            <h1>基隆：10/15前員警上班日赴花蓮救災可請1天公差假</h1>
            <p>Keelung: Police officers can take one day of official leave if they go to Hualien to help with disaster relief on a workday before October 15.</p>
            <p>The Matagida Creek in Hualien County overflowed, which caused serious damage in Guangfu Township. Because of this, Lin Hsin-hsiung, the head of the Keelung City Police Department, announced today that police officers from the city police department and all police stations can take one day of official leave. This is for officers who volunteer to help with disaster relief on a workday. This offer is valid until October 15.</p>
            <p>In the morning, Lin Hsin-hsiung said in the "Keelung Police Supervisors Group" on LINE that Hualien's Guangfu Township suffered a lot of damage. So, officers from the Keelung City Police Department and its different branches can take one day of official leave if they volunteer to help with the cleanup and relief work on a workday.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsin-hsiung also said that officers who want to go to Hualien can tell their department. They don't need to show proof later. Each department should make sure that daily police work is not affected. Their supervisor must agree first. After that, the department will make a list of the officers who went. Within three days, staff from the city police department will send this list to the personnel office for approval. Police stations can send their requests to their district office for approval.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsin-hsiung said this plan is good until October 15. He asked all district police chiefs to tell their officers. He also asked the personnel office and all police station personnel units to help fully.</p>

            <h1>海巡署：編列國安韌性特別預算刻不容緩</h1>
            <p>Coast Guard Administration: It is urgent to create a special budget for national security because of ongoing threats.</p>
            <p>Some news reports said that there is no urgent need for a national security budget. But today, Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said that China's "gray zone" actions are happening all the time. The current yearly budget and equipment are not enough to deal with them. So, the CGA asks for support to get this special budget quickly because it is very important.</p>
            <p>The Liberty Times newspaper reported that the Legislature's budget office recently looked at the Executive Yuan's "Special Budget for National Security and Economic-Social Resilience in Response to International Situations." The office questioned if the budget for "strengthening national defense" was truly urgent. Blue and white party lawmakers agreed with this question.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, the CGA explained in a press release that Taiwan is still facing military threats from China. The situation in the seas around Taiwan is getting more serious. The Ocean Affairs Council needs to handle many challenges related to national security, public safety, and peace. Especially, China's "gray zone" actions keep happening, testing Taiwan's defenses. The yearly budget and current staff and equipment are no longer enough to respond to the difficult international situation and the growing "gray zone" threats.</p>
            <p>At the same time, there is a strong need to add over NT$29.5 billion to the "Special Budget for National Security and Economic-Social Resilience in Response to International Situations." This money will fully support making the Coast Guard modern and stronger.</p>
            <p>The CGA said that to solve the problem of not having enough resources on land and at sea, the Ocean Affairs Council has told the CGA to think in 3D: land, sea, and air. This means making the CGA's air power stronger, using modern radar, and doing surveys of all sea areas. This will build a complete monitoring system.</p>
            <p>Also, they will increase the number of ships placed in key areas. This will help them respond more quickly to China's "gray zone" strategies. They will also work hard to improve their equipment and supplies.</p>
            <p>The CGA said they hope to set up infrared thermal imaging systems and other equipment along the entire coast of Taiwan as soon as possible. This will help them guard the country better at night when it's hard to see with human eyes. They also want to add detection abilities from land, sea, and air. This will make the Coast Guard's ability to protect Taiwan's waters much better and cover more areas. It will help them deal with China's many different types of threats.</p>
            <p>The CGA emphasized that the government's proposal for a special law for national security and a special budget shows the country's strong will. It is also a promise to the people of Taiwan. They see the threats, and they must be ready to face them with strength. They need to build new ships for the next stage quickly and bring in new technology like unmanned vehicles and infrared monitoring equipment. This will make their overall ability to enforce laws in the sea much stronger.</p>
            <p>The CGA asks everyone in society to support the urgent and necessary request for this special budget. This will make the ocean not just a border, but also Taiwan's first line of defense.</p>

            <h1>丹麥軍方證實 不明無人機連兩夜現蹤軍事地點</h1>
            <p>Danish military confirms unknown drones have been seen over military places for two nights in a row.</p>
            <p>Today, the Danish military said that drones have been seen over many military places in the country for two nights in a row. For the past week, people across Denmark have continued to see unknown drones.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the Danish military said in a statement: "The military can confirm that several drones were seen at night over various military locations. We have moved our military forces to respond."</p>
            <p>The Danish military did not give more information about these events or how the military is responding.</p>
            <p>Danish media reported that no airports in the country were closed at night.</p>
            <p>Since September 22, there have been many reports of unknown drones in Denmark and Norway. This caused several airports to close for a short time. The Danish government has suggested that Russia might be involved.</p>
            <p>On September 27, the Danish military also said that unknown drones were seen over "several military locations" during the night of September 26-27. However, they refused to give more details.</p>
            <p>The Danish police confirmed that on the evening of September 26, "1 to 2 drones" were seen flying near and over the Karup military base. This is Denmark's largest military base. All military helicopters, air space monitoring facilities, flight schools, and logistics support units are located at this base.</p>
            <p>A NATO spokesperson said that after these events, NATO has increased its alert level in the Baltic Sea area.</p>
