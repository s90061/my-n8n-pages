            <h1>CDMO Business Grows, Bora Pharmaceuticals' First Half EPS Reaches NT$19.5</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals has shared its financial report for the first half of the year. The company earned NT$9.347 billion in sales. Their CDMO business, which stands for Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization, grew well. The company's net profit for its owners was NT$2.016 billion, which is 11.9% more than last year. The earnings per share (EPS) was NT$19.5, meaning they earned almost twice their share value.</p>
            <p>Today, Bora Pharmaceuticals announced that its CDMO business grew a lot in the first half of this year. This was because they made more products and started making new types of medicines. Their sales, including internal orders, went up by 69.5% from last year, reaching over NT$5.01 billion. However, during a time when they were combining different parts of the company, their factory in Maryland, USA, which makes sterile injections, and their factory in Zhunan, Taiwan, both had delays in making products. This slowed things down. But this problem got better in June, and they will now finish the delayed orders. The company sees clearly that they have enough orders for a long time, and the demand for their services is strong.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals said they are still putting more money into their CDMO business around the world. Their factory in Canada recently added a new production line for skin medicines. This new line will help them make these medicines faster, in larger amounts, and with more flexibility. This will help the Canadian factory grow.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injection production line in Maryland, USA, is planned to start working in the third quarter of this year. Also, starting from 2026, the AST isolated filling system's automatic lines will begin to operate. In addition, customers at the Maple Grove factory in Minnesota, USA, who are in the clinical trial stage, have become stronger, long-term partners with Bora Pharmaceuticals in the first half of this year. Many drug companies have started signing agreements because they want to use the benefits of making products in the USA.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheng Bao-hsi, the chairman of Bora Pharmaceuticals, stated that since the start of this year, the CDMO business has gained 8 new customers. Most of these new orders are handled by the Maple Grove factory in North America, which is a main center for local manufacturing. This year, the value of new orders received is US$138 million. The new orders are mostly for the Canadian factory and the sterile medicine factories. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego factory, which was added through the merger with TaiFu Biologics, has started working. Several American drug companies that are in the later stages of developing medicines have asked about the plan to increase production by 2000 liters.</p>
