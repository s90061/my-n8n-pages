            <h1>Trump-Putin Meeting to Discuss Russia-Ukraine War; German Chancellor Assumes Zelenskyy Will Attend</h1>
            <p>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, will meet with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, on August 15th to talk about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. Today, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany believes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be at this important meeting.</p>
            <p>News from AFP says that Putin and Trump will meet in Alaska, USA. They will try to solve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has lasted more than three years. Ukraine and Europe say that the government in Kyiv must be part of these talks.</p>
            <p>Mr. Merz spoke on German TV (ARD). He said, "We hope and expect that the Ukrainian government, President Zelenskyy, will be part of this meeting."</p>
            <p>Mr. Merz told German TV that the government in Berlin is working closely with Washington. They want to make sure Mr. Zelenskyy attends the talks.</p>
            <p>He also said, "We cannot accept Russia and the United States talking about or even deciding on land issues without including Europeans and Ukrainians. I believe the US government has the same opinion as us."</p>
            <p>Mr. Merz said he hopes these talks will lead to important steps towards peace, maybe even a big change.</p>
            <p>He stated, "We hope for a big change on August 15th. Most importantly, we want a ceasefire and peace talks to happen in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine have had three rounds of talks this year, but they have not agreed on a ceasefire.</p>

            <h1>6.1 Earthquake in Western Turkey; Only 11 km Deep, Many Buildings Reported Down</h1>
            <p>Today, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority of Turkey said that a 6.1 magnitude earthquake happened in Balikesir province in the west. Local news showed pictures of many buildings falling down because of this earthquake.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said the earthquake in Balikesir happened at 7:53 PM local time. Its depth was 11 kilometers. Many provinces, including Istanbul and the popular tourist city Izmir, felt the earthquake.</p>
            <p>Balikesir province is near Istanbul, which is the biggest city in Turkey.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Turkish news showed images of several buildings falling down in Balikesir province because of the earthquake. Officials have not yet said how much damage there is or how many people were hurt or died.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press, citing local news, reported that buildings fell down in Sindirgi town, where the earthquake was strongest.</p>
            <p>According to AFAD, there have been many smaller earthquakes (aftershocks) after the main one. One of them was 4.6 in magnitude. AFAD asked people not to go into damaged buildings.</p>
            <p>Turkey's Interior Minister, Ali Yerlikaya, posted on X that AFAD's emergency teams have started checking areas around Istanbul and nearby provinces.</p>
            <p>The German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) measured the earthquake as 6.19 magnitude and 10 kilometers deep.</p>
            <p>In 2023, Turkey had a very strong 7.8 magnitude earthquake. It killed 53,000 people and destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings in the southern and southeastern provinces. That earthquake also killed 6,000 people in northern Syria, which is next to Turkey.</p>

            <h1>Netanyahu: New Attack to Remove Hamas from Gaza City Will Start Soon</h1>
            <p>Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expects a new attack on Gaza will finish "quite quickly." He stated that first, "safe zones" will be made so that people living in Gaza City can move out.</p>
            <p>News from AFP and Reuters says that on August 8th, Netanyahu's security cabinet approved a plan to control Gaza City. This plan has been criticized a lot. Today, he said he has no other choice but to "finish the job" by defeating Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group, and getting the hostages freed.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said the new attack on the Gaza Strip aims to deal with two main remaining Hamas strongholds: one in Gaza City and one in a central camp in Al-Mawasi. He argued that since Hamas refuses to give up its weapons, this is his only choice.</p>
            <p>It is not yet clear when the Israeli army will start this new attack. Netanyahu said, "We have set a very fast timeline for this operation. We hope, first, that safe zones can be created so that civilians in Gaza City can move out."</p>
            <p>According to Netanyahu, the 1 million people who lived in Gaza City before the war will move into these "safe zones." Palestinians say that their past experiences show that even in safe zones, they are not safe from Israeli army attacks.</p>
            <p>Representatives from European countries at the United Nations said that hunger is spreading in Gaza. They believe Israel's plan will only make the situation worse.</p>
            <p>Denmark, France, Greece, Slovenia, and the UK said in a joint statement: "More military actions will only put the lives of all Gaza civilians at risk, including the remaining hostages. It will also cause more unnecessary suffering. This is a crisis made by people, so urgent action is needed to stop the hunger and send help quickly to Gaza."</p>
