Artificial intelligence (AI) is appearing in more and more everyday devices, from smart speakers to even refrigerators and washing machines. Companies say these AI-powered devices make our lives easier, helping us save time and energy. For example, a smart fridge might tell you when you're low on milk, or a washing machine could choose the best washing cycle automatically.

However, some people are starting to worry. A big concern is privacy, as these devices often collect a lot of information about our habits. There are also fears about security, as any internet-connected device could be hacked. While the idea of a fully automated home sounds good, many users wonder if the benefits of AI in simple household items are truly worth the risks and the extra cost. Experts suggest people should think carefully about what data they share and whether they really need every new smart gadget.

**Hybrid Work Is Here to Stay, Says New Report**

A recent report suggests that working from a mix of home and office, known as hybrid work, has become a common way to work for many businesses. Even though some companies still prefer all their employees to be in the office full-time, the report shows that the flexibility of hybrid models is very popular with workers.

Many employees feel happier and more productive when they have the choice to work from home sometimes. This way of working can also help companies keep their best employees. However, hybrid work also has its challenges. Businesses need to find new ways to help team members feel connected and make sure everyone understands the company's goals, whether they are in the office or working remotely. Finding the right balance is key for companies in the future.

**Cities Fight Back Against Too Many Tourists**

Many famous cities around the world are facing a problem called "overtourism." This happens when too many visitors come to a place, making it difficult for local people to live comfortably and sometimes harming the environment. Popular places like Venice in Italy, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and Barcelona in Spain are feeling the pressure from large numbers of tourists.

To deal with this, some cities are introducing new rules. For example, they might charge tourists more money to enter, limit the number of cruise ships that can visit, or make it harder for people to rent out their homes for short periods on sites like Airbnb. These steps are being taken to reduce the crowds, protect the city's character, and improve the quality of life for residents. The goal is to find a better balance between tourism and local well-being.
