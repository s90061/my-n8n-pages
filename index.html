            <h1>Fritz Easily Wins and Reaches US Open Quarterfinals; He is Now the Only American Hope</h1>
            <p>Today, Taylor Fritz, the best American tennis player, won easily against Tomas Machac from the Czech Republic in three sets. This win puts him strongly into the men's quarterfinals at the US Open.</p>
            <p>Fritz was the second-place winner last year. After the third round this year, he is the only American male player still in the US Open.</p>
            <p>Fritz did not give Machac, who was the 21st ranked player, many chances today. He won the match in only 1 hour and 38 minutes with scores of 6-4, 6-3, and 6-3.</p>
            <p>Other American male players, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul, and Frances Tiafoe, were all out of the competition in the third round. Now, all hope for an American man to win a Grand Slam title after 23 years is on Fritz.</p>
            <p>The last American man to win a Grand Slam was Andy Roddick in 2003.</p>
            <p>Fritz said, "I hope the people watching will truly support me now, because I am the last one left."</p>
            <p>He added, "To be honest, it is quite surprising. I think the male players had a hard week. Shelton was hurt and struggled. Tiafoe and Paul played against very strong opponents who had excellent skills, so that is what happened."</p>
            <p>"I am glad to be here, and as I said, if the crowd can support me, we truly have a chance to win."</p>
            <p>Fritz has made it to the men's singles quarterfinals at the US Open three times in a row. Last year, he played in the final match. But this year, he is the 4th ranked player, so it might be harder for him to do as well as last year.</p>
            <p>Fritz will play against Novak Djokovic on September 2nd. He has played against Djokovic 10 times before and has lost every time.</p>
            <p>Fritz said, "I think in the first seven or eight matches we played, I was not good enough and did not have many chances. But in our last two games, I feel I have gotten better and can now play well against him."</p>

            <h1>Bird Flu Risk High This Autumn and Winter, Taiwan Agency Starts Stronger Prevention</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Agency (APHIA) says there is a high chance of bird flu this autumn and winter. Starting now until next March, they will work with local governments to put stronger prevention plans into action. They are also asking businesses to tell animal health offices if they see anything strange. If businesses do not report, they could be fined up to NT$1 million.</p>
            <p>The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Agency, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, shared a new statement today. It says the risk of H5N1 bird flu this autumn and winter is still high. To lower the chance of the disease starting and spreading, they will work with local governments from today until March 31, 2026. Together, they will carry out "stronger bird flu prevention steps for autumn and winter."</p>
            <p>APHIA explained that bird flu mainly spreads through wild birds that travel. These birds carry the sickness as they fly from one country to another. Taiwan is on the path where many of these birds fly. Every year from November to March, many birds come to Taiwan for winter. This is also the time when bad bird flu outbreaks often happen.</p>
            <p>APHIA reminded everyone that September and October are for getting ready for stronger prevention. They ask businesses that raise birds to check and prepare their stored prevention items. They also need to train staff who work with animals on what to do if there is an outbreak. They should also watch how many wild birds there are and send out warnings when needed. For bird farms that have a high risk, like those that have had bird flu many times in the last 5 years, or big farms that are not officially registered, APHIA will check their safety rules. They will also train bird farmers on how to keep their farms safe from diseases.</p>
            <p>APHIA said that from the end of October until next March is when the disease is most likely to spread. During this time, they will check for the disease more often. They will also mark areas where the risk is high. They will clean public places in towns and cities that are bird flu hot spots. They will also make sure that places where animals are killed (slaughterhouses) clean and disinfect their areas and vehicles well. This is to stop the disease from starting and spreading.</p>
            <p>APHIA asked businesses to report any strange signs right away to the local animal health office. This will help to deal with the problem quickly and stop the disease from spreading. If businesses do not report as the law says (according to the "Statute for Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Diseases"), they will not get money for their animals that are killed to stop the disease. Also, they could be fined up to NT$1 million.</p>
