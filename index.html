            <h1>Egypt's Foreign Minister: Hamas Will Not Have Any Role in Gaza's Future</h1>
            <p>Egypt's Foreign Minister, Badr Abdelatty, said today that Hamas will not play any part in Gaza's future. He said this in Paris. Egypt is an important country helping to solve the conflict between Israel and Palestine.</p>
            <p>This statement comes as Hamas is thinking about President Trump's peace plan. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has already said he supports this plan.</p>
            <p>During a meeting in Paris, Abdelatty stated, "Hamas has no role in the future."</p>
            <p>He also said, "All of us, Arabs and Muslims, agree on this. Even people inside Hamas know very well that they will not have a role later. This is true."</p>
            <p>However, he added, "We should not give anyone an excuse to kill so many innocent people every day, using Hamas as a reason."</p>
            <p>"This is an ongoing ethnic cleansing and genocide. It's truly enough, it's enough."</p>

            <h1>US Treasury Secretary: US-China Talks Should Make Big Progress Soon</h1>
            <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that the leaders of the US and China will meet in Korea at the end of the month. Their trade teams will also talk. He believes this round of talks should be the best one and bring big progress because the leaders will speak face-to-face. China has bought less soybeans from the US. Other countries will buy more to make up for this.</p>
            <p>Scott Bessent spoke on the CNBC business channel. He said that the most important thing to expect from the meeting between the US and China leaders is a policy meeting. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet in Korea at the end of the month. Bessent also said, "I will lead the negotiating team to talk with China's Vice Premier (He Lifeng)."</p>
            <p>Bessent pointed out that direct talks between the two leaders are very helpful for setting up plans and moving trade forward. This makes it much easier for the negotiating teams. Both sides have agreed to continue their trade agreement for 90 days, which ends on November 10th. He believes that with Trump leading and the good relationship between Trump and Xi, this round of talks should be the best and will have important breakthroughs.</p>
            <p>He said they can continue to discuss things like China buying US farm products. In January 2020, during Trump's first term, the US and China made a trade deal. China agreed to buy over $50 billion in farm products and did so that year. But after former President Joe Biden became president, China did not continue to keep this part of the agreement.</p>
            <p>During talks in Geneva, Bessent asked Chinese officials why they did not keep buying US soybeans and other products. They only answered with one word: "Biden."</p>
            <p>Bessent said that high-level Chinese officials used American farmers, especially soybean farmers, as a bargaining chip in talks. More than 90% of American farmers support Trump. China buying less US soybeans will be partly covered by trade deals with other countries. Almost all US agreements with other countries include buying farm products.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Drop as OPEC+ May Produce More and US Government Stays Closed</h1>
            <p>Today, oil prices fell to their lowest in almost five months. This happened because the group of oil-producing countries, OPEC+, is expected to agree to produce more oil at their meeting this weekend. Also, the US government is still shut down, which makes people worried. This concern about the US economy also pushed prices down.</p>
            <p>The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in November went down by 2.1%. It is now $60.48 per barrel.</p>
            <p>The price of Brent crude oil from the North Sea for delivery in December went down by 1.9%. It is now $64.11 per barrel.</p>
