            <h1>Good Morning World: News in Brief</h1>
            <p>For 2026, the central government's money for local governments has been decided. Most cities and counties will get more money, except for Lienchiang County (Matsu). The total amount is a new high of NT$848.82 billion, which is 90.2% more than last year. Taipei City will get the most, over NT$114.92 billion, which is NT$46,000 per person. New Taipei City, which has the most people, will get the least per person, less than NT$24,000. Lienchiang County will receive less money than last year, but the Ministry of Finance will add special funds to make up for it. They will get about NT$720 million in total, which is NT$53,259 per person.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Digital Affairs says that all 10 undersea internet cables in Taiwan are working well. Three international cables are broken, but this does not affect communication. Taiwan's cable monitoring system showed that 8 or 9 undersea cables were broken at the same time. Chunghwa Telecom explained on September 2nd that all domestic cables were fixed earlier this year and are working normally. They said that the international cables mentioned, such as EAC2, EAC1, C2C, RNAL, and FNAL, are not owned by Chunghwa Telecom. Chunghwa Telecom's own international cable services are all working fine. The Ministry of Digital Affairs also said that Taiwan's 10 domestic undersea cables are all working well. Three of the 14 international cables are broken and need to be fixed. However, services are still provided using other routes, so current communication services are not affected.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration says that this week will mostly have afternoon thunderstorms. On September 3rd, people in the western mountain areas should be careful of heavy rain. On September 4th, there will be fewer clouds, so there might be some sunshine. From the evening of September 7th to early morning of September 8th, there will be a total lunar eclipse. But because moist air from the south is moving north, the southern and Hualien/Taitung areas will have thick clouds, making it hard to see the eclipse. In the central and northern parts of Taiwan, there might be a chance to see the moon through gaps in the clouds.</p>
            <p>TSMC says that the US government has removed a special permission for its factory in Nanjing. They are now thinking about what to do. The US recently said it would stop allowing big chip makers like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Intel to use American semiconductor equipment in China. On September 2nd, TSMC confirmed that the US government told them the special permission for TSMC (Nanjing) will end on December 31st. TSMC said they are looking at the situation and will take suitable actions. The Ministry of Economic Affairs added that the US Bureau of Industry and Security also cancelled similar permissions for two Korean companies last week. So, this action is likely not only against TSMC. The Nanjing factory only makes up about 3% of TSMC's total production, and an even smaller part of Taiwan's total semiconductor production. So, it is believed this will not greatly affect the overall competition in the industry.</p>
            <p>Protests against the government are spreading in Indonesia. People are angry because lawmakers are getting good benefits and more people are losing their jobs. On August 25th, people protested in Jakarta, the capital city. They were unhappy that members of parliament were getting rich benefits. The protests quickly became very big across the country after police and protesters fought. By September 2nd, at least 8 people had died. This is the biggest problem President Prabowo has faced since he started his job. Student groups and officials in Indonesia said that police used tear gas on protesters near two universities in Bandung. Angry protesters in many cities across the country burned local government buildings and police stations. They also damaged public property, stole things from offices, and set fire to cars. However, Indonesian officials said that President Prabowo will still go to Beijing on September 3rd for China's celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of the War of Resistance.</p>
            <p>Before a military parade by the Chinese Communist Party, signs against the party appeared on a tall building in Chongqing, China. These big signs were shown on August 29th. Deutsche Welle Chinese reported on September 1st that they interviewed Qi Hong, who started this action. Qi Hong said that after he set up the signs, he took his wife and two daughters to the UK. He does not know what will happen next. Qi Hong said he did this because of the "hate messages" everywhere before the Chinese Communist Party's September 3rd military parade. He also said that the Chinese Communist Party always talks about Japan's invasion of China but never thinks about the many terrible things it has done itself. Some people called him a hero, but Qi Hong said, "I am not a hero. I am a normal person. I just couldn't stand it anymore, someone had to do something."</p>
            <p>A 6-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan late on August 31st. It caused a lot of damage in Kunar province, which is far away and next to Pakistan. Many simple houses made of mud and stone in the steep valleys fell down. The Taliban government said that over 1,400 people died and more than 3,000 were hurt. Many people lost their homes and are sleeping outside. Rescuers searched all night to find people trapped under the fallen buildings.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party held a "walking tour" event on August 30th. During the event, the crowd and the police faced each other. Several party members went over the fences and pushed police officers many times. This caused 8 police officers to get hurt. On September 2nd, the Zhongzheng First Police Precinct of Taipei City said they have sent notices to Huang Kuo-chang, the chairman of the Taiwan People's Party, and two other men (Mr. Liao and Mr. Ho). They must report to the police before mid-September to explain what happened. The police will then deal with the case according to the law. Huang Kuo-chang called this action "persecution" and said he wished they would only target him.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese pitcher Teng Kai-wei played a great game on September 1st. He was pitching for the San Francisco Giants against the Colorado Rockies at their home field, which is known as a "hitter's paradise." He pitched for 5.1 innings, giving up only 2 runs, and got his first win as a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). This is the first time in 7 years that a Taiwanese pitcher has won a starting game in MLB since Chen Wei-yin in 2018. The other team hit 9 times, often getting players into scoring positions. But Teng Kai-wei stopped them with 8 strikeouts, which was his highest ever. He only allowed 2 runs, both in the 6th inning. The Giants won the game 8-2. The Giants' manager, Melvin, said Teng Kai-wei has an "arm made of rubber" and praised him for becoming more confident as he pitched.</p>
            <p>A 99-year-old American soldier, Kennedy, saw the end of World War II. During the war, he was an electrician on the USS Missouri. 80 years ago, he saw Japanese representatives sign the surrender document. General Douglas MacArthur led the ceremony where Japan gave up, ending a terrible war that killed tens of millions of people. Kennedy went back to the place, feeling very emotional. He told CNA, "I remember very clearly, General MacArthur said â€“ the ceremony is now over."</p>
            <p>Taiwan was once called "the island of liver disease." People with severe liver disease could only live longer by getting a liver transplant. Dr. Chen Chao-long, who is now an honorary superintendent at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, was a pioneer in liver transplants in Taiwan. He successfully performed the first liver transplant in Asia and is called "the father of liver transplants in Asia." Dr. Chen also helped change the rules. In 1987, he helped Taiwan become the first country in Asia to make laws for organ transplants from brain-dead patients. This was 10 to 12 years before Japan and South Korea did. Dr. Chen knew that there were not enough organ donations. So, he worked hard to study living-donor liver transplants. His team at Kaohsiung Chang Gung has done over 2,500 liver transplant surgeries. They have set a world record with a more than 90% survival rate after 5 years for living-donor transplants.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan and Japan Ruling Parties Hold Diplomacy and Defense Talks in Taipei for the First Time with Extended Meeting</h1>
            <p>Japanese news sources say that a "2+2" meeting for diplomacy and defense will happen today in Taipei. Members of the ruling parties from Taiwan and Japan will be there. After this meeting, there will be an extended meeting for the first time. Leaders from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party's "Taiwan Policy Review Task Force" will also join.</p>
            <p>Sankei Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, reported that people who know a lot about Taiwan-Japan diplomacy said that the "2+2" meeting will happen today in Taipei. Members of the Democratic Progressive Party (Taiwan's ruling party) and the Liberal Democratic Party (Japan's ruling party) who work in foreign affairs and defense will attend. This will be the first "2+2" talk between the ruling parties since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government started.</p>
            <p>From Japan, Mr. Hoshino Takeshi, who leads the Liberal Democratic Party's foreign affairs group, and Mr. Iwata Kazuchika, who leads their defense group, will join the meeting.</p>
            <p>After the main talks, an extended meeting will be held for the first time. Leaders from the Liberal Democratic Party's "Taiwan Policy Review Task Force" and others will join.</p>
            <p>During the meeting, they will discuss topics like China increasing its military pressure on Taiwan. They will also talk about safety in the Indo-Pacific area, including the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Also, because there have been cases where undersea internet cables near Taiwan were possibly damaged by China, the meeting will also talk about how Taiwan and Japan can work together to make communication networks stronger.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that Taiwan and Japan do not have formal diplomatic relations, so they don't have official ways to coordinate their policies. The "2+2" talks with members of the ruling parties from both sides aim to find common ideas and make plans.</p>
            <p>This is the first "2+2" talk between the ruling parties of Taiwan and Japan since the Ishiba government started at the end of last year. The last meeting was on August 21st last year at the Liberal Democratic Party headquarters in Tokyo.</p>

            <h1>Old Photos Unboxed: Dr. Chen Chao-long, Father of Liver Transplants in Asia</h1>
            <p>Taiwan was once known as "the island of liver disease." People with severe liver disease could only live longer by getting a liver transplant. Dr. Chen Chao-long, who is now an honorary superintendent at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, was a pioneer in liver transplants in Taiwan. He successfully performed the first liver transplant in Asia and is called "the father of liver transplants in Asia."</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen Chao-long graduated from Kaohsiung Medical College. When he was a resident doctor at Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, he had the chance to draw pictures for a "Liver Surgery" textbook for Professor Lin Tien-yu of National Taiwan University. This made him interested in liver transplants. Later, he went abroad to study and met Professor Thomas Starzl, a top expert in liver transplants at the University of Pittsburgh in the US. Dr. Chen became his good assistant. Even though he was asked to stay in the US, Dr. Chen chose to come back to Taiwan to bring his knowledge and skills to his home country.</p>
            <p>Everything is hard at the beginning. Dr. Chen Chao-long worked hard to promote liver transplants. To make his hands more skilled, he even practiced tying 200 knots every day.</p>
            <p>On March 22, 1984, Dr. Chen Chao-long performed a 32-hour surgery on a female patient named Lin Ah-yen, who was in a liver coma. This was Taiwan's first liver transplant using an organ from a brain-dead donor and also the first liver transplant in Asia.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen Chao-long also helped change medical rules. In 1987, he helped Taiwan create the first law in Asia for organ transplants from brain-dead patients. This was 10 to 12 years earlier than Japan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen Chao-long knew that there were not enough organ donations. So, he actively researched living-donor liver transplants. His team at Kaohsiung Chang Gung has done over 2,500 liver transplant surgeries. They have set a world record with a more than 90% survival rate after 5 years for living-donor transplants.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Dr. Chen Chao-long received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Liver Transplant Society (ILTS). He was the first Chinese person to receive this award. Japanese doctors praised his excellent surgical skills as "the limit of human ability." His story has also been made into a Japanese manga called "Shine, Scalpel!", as well as novels, movies, and a Japanese TV drama called "The Lone Scalpel."</p>
