**Tibetans celebrate the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, happy about his decision on reincarnation**

Today, Tibetans in Delhi, India, gathered to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader. They all wished him a long life and were very happy about his decision for his reincarnation. He said that the Gaden Phodrang Foundation will be the only group to choose the next Dalai Lama.

The Dalai Lama announced his decision on July 2nd. This made Tibetans very happy, especially because China has tried to interfere with the reincarnation process. The Tibetan government-in-exile held the birthday celebration in Delhi. People offered traditional scarves and shared cake. Tibetan groups also performed dances and songs.

Officials from the Tibetan government thanked the Dalai Lama for his decision. They also thanked high-ranking Tibetan religious leaders for not letting China interfere. A Tibetan official, Dorje Tsering, said that the Dalai Lama's announcement is the best answer to China's attempts.

Young Tibetans also shared their happiness. Tenzin Ingsel Kyibuk said he was happy about the news but also wished the Dalai Lama good health. Tenzin Woezey said she was very happy because it means Tibetans will continue to have a good life. Another Tibetan, Karten Tsering, said that the choice of the next Dalai Lama will be made by Tibetans and the Gaden Phodrang Foundation, following tradition.

The Dalai Lama's office had said in 2019 that he would decide about his reincarnation at age 90. The Tibetan government will celebrate the Dalai Lama's birthday for a whole year to honor his kindness and ideas.
