            <h1>Rubber Shoe Possibly Stuck in Taipei Metro Escalator at Xinpu Station, Four People Fell and Were Hurt</h1>
            <p>On October 11, around noon, an escalator at Xinpu Station on the Taipei Metro Bannan Line stopped working. It seems a passenger's rubber shoe got stuck. This made the escalator shake and caused people to fall. The New Taipei City Fire Department said that four people were hurt. Only one woman had a sprained hand and went to the hospital. She was awake when she went to the hospital.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Fire Department said they got a call around 12:30 PM. People reported that a rubber shoe was stuck in the escalator at Exit 5 of Xinpu Station. This caused the escalator to break, and passengers fell. Four people were hurt in total.</p>
            <p>Two of the injured people left on their own. One person got a simple bandage and did not want to go to the hospital. The other person, a woman, had a sprained hand. She was awake and was taken to Taipei Hospital, which is part of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p>
            <p>The Haishan Police Station, which is in charge of the area, said that officers went to check. They found that a passenger's rubber shoe seemed to be stuck in the escalator. This made the escalator shake and caused people to fall.</p>
            <p>The police said that the Taipei Metro Company will find out the exact reason for the escalator breaking down. For now, the escalator is turned off and cannot be used.</p>

            <h1>Changhua's Industries are Quiet but are "Hidden Champions," County Government Book Tells Their Stories</h1>
            <p>On October 11, the Changhua County Government announced a new book. Changhua County has important industries like plumbing parts, socks, bicycles, and tires. Many of these are "hidden champions." This means they are very successful but not widely known. The new book tells the stories of these important local industries. It will help more people learn about them. It also shows that the knowledge of these industries will be passed to the next generation.</p>
            <p>Today, the Changhua County Government held a book launch at the Changhua International Exhibition Center. The book is called "Changhua Smart Manufacturing: From Industry Inheritance to Sustainable Development." Changhua County Magistrate Wang Huei-mei was there. She said that Changhua has many good things, but it has been too quiet in the past. Many people say "Made in Taiwan" on the world stage, but many of those things are actually "Made in Changhua." This book will help more people know this.</p>
            <p>She said that most people think Changhua's industries are old and traditional. But many of them are changing and getting better. Many business owners work hard. Every industry has a story of hard work. Every small part made is very important for how industries work. For example, small sealing parts are very important in machines, vehicles, and factory equipment. They make sure machines work well and safely.</p>
            <p>Wang Huei-mei said that Changhua's industries, from plumbing parts to socks, from bicycle parts to rubber tires, quietly help Taiwan and the world. Changhua's industries are not flashy, but they affect the world. They are called "hidden champions," but most people don't know this. The book has interesting stories, and she hopes people will read it. She also believes that "Made in Changhua" will continue to be important in the world.</p>
            <p>The Economic and Green Energy Development Department of the Changhua County Government said the book includes stories from industry groups. These include plumbing parts in Dingfanpu, Lukang Township; socks in Shetou Township; woven belts in Hemei Township; and bicycles and tires in Yuanlin City and Dacun Township. These industries are not as bright as high-tech industries, but they are deeply rooted in the area. They continue to affect Taiwan and the world's industries. This shows how strong Changhua's industries are.</p>
