Discussions about chip tariffs, especially from former US President Trump, are influencing how people feel about investing in Taiwan's stock market. While Trump sent tariff letters to many countries, Taiwan was not on that list. The success of NVIDIA, a big company that makes AI chips, is helping Taiwan's stock market grow.

Big cloud service companies are still spending a lot of money on AI, even trying to hire the best people with very high salaries. This shows that interest in AI is not decreasing. Everyone is waiting for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to share its future plans on July 17th. This information will be important for understanding how the technology industry will do in the next few months.

It seems that past tariffs on Japan and Korea did not cause their stock markets to fall, which might mean tariffs have less impact now. However, for a short time, these tariff talks are still making investors careful. Everyone is waiting to see the final decisions on tariffs for Taiwan and chip-related taxes.

**Taipei City Government Urges Public to Avoid Going Out During Town Resilience Exercise on July 17 Afternoon**

Taipei's annual "Wan An Exercise" will now be part of a new "Town Resilience Exercise." This year, it will happen on July 17th, from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM. During these 30 minutes, there will be air raid alarms.

Everyone in the city, including people and cars, must follow the police and civil defense workers' instructions. This means practicing evacuation, traffic control, and other important drills. If you hear the alarm or get an alert on your phone, you should go to the nearest safe place as told by the staff.

This exercise is like practicing for a real wartime situation to help reduce possible harm. If people do not follow the rules, they could get a fine between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000. Examples of not following rules include driving, walking, or riding bikes in areas that are closed, or not obeying traffic control. The city has told hotels and given out leaflets in many languages to help everyone prepare.

**Guardians Home Field Fans' Indecent Behavior and Entry into Restricted Area; Team Strengthens Control**

During a recent Fubon Guardians home baseball game, some fans behaved badly and went into areas they were not allowed to enter. For example, one fan brought an inflatable doll and acted inappropriately, and this was recorded and shared online. Another fan also went into a restricted area.

The team is very sorry about these incidents and has checked its security procedures with the league. The Fubon Guardians want to make sure their games are suitable for families. They will improve how they control who enters restricted areas and will have more security staff checking the fan sections.

If fans go into forbidden areas or act in ways that are not acceptable, the police will be asked to remove them from the stadium. The team asks all fans to follow the stadium rules and listen to the staff to help keep the viewing environment safe, friendly, and comfortable for everyone.
