            <h1>Taiwan to Receive New Weapons from US Next Year</h1>
            <p>Taiwan will get many important weapons from the United States next year. This is what the Ministry of National Defense's budget report shows. These weapons include all 14 Volcano mine-laying systems, the first 2 MQ-9B drones, the last 5 MS-110 pods, 4 MK-48 training torpedoes, and the last 28 M1A2T tanks. These will make Taiwan's army much stronger.</p>
            <p>In recent years, China has often threatened Taiwan with words and military actions. Chinese planes and ships have entered the areas around Taiwan's sea and air. They often cross the middle line of the Taiwan Strait and do military exercises nearby. This seriously affects peace and stability in the area. Taiwan's army is training more and changing. It is also making its own weapons and buying equipment from other countries to prepare for possible dangers.</p>
            <p>The public version of the 2026 National Defense budget report was sent to the parliament on August 29th. It shows that many important military items bought from other countries will arrive in Taiwan next year. These include 14 Volcano vehicle-mounted mine-laying systems for the army and the last 28 M1A2T tanks. For the air force, the first 2 (out of 4) MQ-9B high-altitude drones will arrive, along with the last 5 (out of 6) new MS-110 reconnaissance pods for F-16V (blk70) planes. The navy will receive the first 4 training torpedoes (out of 24 real torpedoes and 4 training ones) for the MK-48 long-range heavy submarine torpedoes.</p>
            <p>For weapons made in Taiwan, the army will receive 24,534 new T112 rifles next year. This is the busiest time for this project (73,049 rifles from 2025 to 2029). In the second part of the tactical short-range drone project, 130 drones will be delivered next year. This is also a busy time for this project (201 drones from 2024 to 2026). For attack drone missile systems, 469 drones that can harm people will be delivered next year. This is the highest number of deliveries.</p>
            <p>For the air force, AIDC will deliver the last 3 Brave Eagle advanced trainer jets (out of 66 in total). For the navy, 20 amphibious reconnaissance rubber boats will be delivered (out of 47 boats from 2026 to 2028). These boats will help the navy check the water near the coast.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that the U.S. allowed Taiwan to buy MK-48 long-range heavy submarine torpedoes in 2017, but they have not arrived yet. After the MK-48 training torpedoes arrive next year, they will be used by the improved Sword Dragon class submarines. Also, Taiwan's own Haikun submarines are expected to use these same torpedoes in the future, making Taiwan's underwater fighting power stronger.</p>
            <p>Also, the Volcano mine-laying systems were supposed to be delivered in two groups. The first 7 systems were planned for 2023, but they were delayed by the U.S. Now, all 14 systems will be delivered at the same time next year.</p>
            <p>Some people had said that this weapon system would turn Taiwan into a "mine island." The army has explained many times that this system is for blocking enemy vehicles on beaches during wartime. These are anti-tank mines that target enemy armored vehicles. They can move fast, work quickly, and have armor protection. They also have features like "self-destruction after a set time," "magnetic sensing," and "easy to find and remove." They are not spread widely or left for a long time. This stops Taiwan's soldiers and people from getting hurt by accident.</p>

            <h1>Former Court Clerk Punished for Growing Cannabis at Home</h1>
            <p>A former court clerk named Xiu, who worked at the Hualien High Court, grew a cannabis plant at home in 2024. He also had two bags of cannabis. A court decided to punish him with 40 days in jail and 1 year and 2 months in prison. Both punishments were suspended for three years. The Disciplinary Court has now decided to lower his rank by two levels. He can appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>The court's decision states that the former clerk, Xiu, worked at the Hualien Branch of the Taiwan High Court from January 2023 to April 2024. In January 2024, he grew one cannabis plant at his home in Hualien County. A friend had asked him to take care of it. In February of the same year, he received two bags of cannabis, which is a Class 2 drug, from someone online. The Hualien County police searched Xiu's home on March 13, 2024, and found the items.</p>
            <p>After this happened, the former clerk Xiu resigned from his job. He admitted what he did when the prosecutor investigated. After he was charged, the Hualien District Court sentenced him to 40 days in jail for having a Class 2 drug, based on the Drug Hazard Control Act. He could pay a fine instead of going to jail. He was also sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison for growing cannabis. Both sentences were suspended for 3 years. The former clerk Xiu did not appeal, so the sentences are final. The Taiwan High Court then sent his case to the Disciplinary Court.</p>
            <p>The Disciplinary Court believed that what the former clerk Xiu did greatly harmed the image of public officials and the reputation of the justice system. The court considered that he admitted his illegal actions during the criminal investigation and trial. He also showed he was sorry for what he did. The court also looked at how he worked during his time in the job. Because of these things, the court decided to lower the former clerk Xiu's rank by two levels. He can appeal this decision.</p>
