            <h1>Empty Bullet Shells Found at Funeral Home in Kaohsiung, Police Looking for Man</h1>
            <p>Today, some people found what looked like bullet shells at the Kaohsiung City Funeral Home. Police went to the place and checked the items. They confirmed there were 14 empty shells. Police believe these were fake bullet shells used for movies. They have no primer and cannot be fired. Police and prosecutors are now looking for a man.</p>
            <p>Officers from the Sanmin Second Precinct of Kaohsiung City Police explained that they received a report around 8 AM. Experts went to the scene to collect evidence. There were 14 empty shells. A first look showed that these empty shells had no primer and could not be fired. They believe these are blank cartridges used for prop guns in movies.</p>
            <p>Police said they checked more security camera videos around the area. They found a man who seemed to take the shells out of his pocket and throw them on the ground. Because someone might have thrown the shells on purpose to scare people, the police have asked the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. The man will be arrested for possibly scaring the public.</p>

            <h1>Israeli Army Fires Near Aid Station in Gaza, 93 More Dead</h1>
            <p>(Gaza City, July 20, Central News Agency) Gaza's civil defense department said that today, the Israeli army fired at a group of Palestinian people trying to get humanitarian aid in the war-torn Palestinian area. This caused 93 deaths and many injuries.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that when trucks with aid arrived in northern Gaza, 80 people were shot dead. Also, 9 people were shot near an aid station in Rafah, in the south. Just 24 hours before, many people had also died from Israeli gunfire in the same place.</p>
            <p>Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for Gaza's civil defense, said that 4 people died near an aid station in Khan Yunus, in southern Gaza.</p>
            <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) stated that a group of 25 trucks carrying food aid crossed the Israeli border and passed a checkpoint. Soon after, near Gaza City, they "met many hungry people, and these groups were then shot at."</p>
            <p>The Israeli army disagreed with the number of deaths. They said that thousands of people were gathered near Gaza City at that time. The Israeli army fired warning shots to "remove the immediate danger to them."</p>
            <p>In Gaza City, Qasem Abu Khater, 36, told reporters that he rushed forward to get a bag of flour. But he found thousands of desperate, hungry people there, and "the deadly crowd pushed each other."</p>
            <p>He said: "Tanks fired at us without aim, and Israeli snipers shot at us, like hunting animals in a forest... Dozens died in front of me, and no one could save anyone."</p>
            <p>The World Food Programme condemned the violence against civilians looking for help, calling it "completely unacceptable."</p>

            <h1>Wang Kuan-hung Not Happy with Silver Medal in World University Games 200m Butterfly, Will Turn Sadness into Motivation</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 21, Central News Agency) Wang Kuan-hung, known as "Taiwan's Butterfly King," won a silver medal today in the men's 200-meter butterfly final at the Rhein-Ruhr World University Games. His time was 1 minute 55.85 seconds, just 0.26 seconds behind the gold medalist. He said he was "very unhappy" and hopes to turn this disappointment into motivation to improve.</p>
            <p>At the last World University Games in Chengdu, Taiwanese swimmer Wang Kuan-hung bravely won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly. After two years, he is back at the World University Games. In the 200-meter butterfly semi-finals, he was ranked first and went to the final. His goal was to get a better medal and win Taiwan's first-ever gold medal in swimming history.</p>
            <p>However, in today's 200-meter butterfly final, Wang Kuan-hung's performance was not as good as in the semi-finals. But he still tried his best to do every move correctly. In the last 50 meters, he quickly caught up and almost made a comeback. Sadly, he missed the gold medal by only 0.26 seconds. But, by winning silver medals in two World University Games in a row, in a very competitive swimming event, Wang Kuan-hung has become the first person from Taiwan to do this.</p>
            <p>After the race, Wang Kuan-hung spoke to the media. He said that compared to his first time at the World University Games two years ago, his mindset this time was much calmer. But he really wanted to get the best result. This made him very unhappy with his performance in the final. He felt bad. He said, "My goal was to get the first gold medal for our team in history. But it is already something to be very proud of that Taiwan's swimming can stand on the podium at international events."</p>
            <p>Wang Kuan-hung will remember the disappointment of missing the gold medal this time. He hopes to turn this feeling into power to move forward. He aims to win the gold medal at the 2026 Asian Games in Nagoya. He said, "I thank my family and friends for coming to cheer for me. I believe this competition has given me good things to help me improve. I am moving towards my biggest goal, next year's Asian Games."</p>
