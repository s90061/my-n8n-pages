https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68936952

Many people in the UK are struggling because prices for everyday things are much higher. A new study by the consumer group Which? shows that millions of households are cutting down on essential items like food and heating. This is happening because inflation, which means prices are rising, is making everything more expensive.

The study found that about 13 million homes have recently had to spend less on necessary goods. Some families are buying cheaper food, while others are using less electricity or gas to save money. People are also finding it hard to pay for their rent or mortgage, and for their cars or public transport.

Experts say that although inflation has slowed down a little, prices are still much higher than they were a few years ago. This means that many families feel poorer and have less money to spend. The government and banks are trying to control prices, but it is taking time. Many people hope that things will get better soon, but for now, daily life is difficult for many.

**Hybrid Work Will Stay for Many US Companies**

https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-hybrid-work-trend-set-continue-even-companies-push-office-returns-2024-05-14/

Many companies in the United States are still using a "hybrid" way of working, where employees spend some days in the office and some days working from home. Even though some bosses want everyone back in the office full-time, new information shows that hybrid work will probably continue to be popular.

A recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York looked at how much people are working from home. It found that about 30% of paid workdays are still done from home. This number has not changed much in the last year, even though more companies are asking their staff to return to the office more often.

Workers like hybrid arrangements because it gives them more flexibility and saves them time and money on commuting. Companies also see some benefits, like saving on office space. However, some leaders worry about teamwork and company culture when people are not together every day. Still, most signs suggest that hybrid work is here to stay, at least for some time.

**Europe Fights Back Against Too Many Tourists**

https://edition.cnn.com/travel/europe-overtourism-solutions-cmd-intl/index.html

Many popular places in Europe are facing a problem called "overtourism." This means too many visitors come to a place at the same time, which can harm the environment, make life difficult for local people, and spoil the experience for tourists themselves. Cities like Venice, Amsterdam, and Barcelona are trying new ways to control the number of visitors.

For example, some places are now asking tourists to pay a small fee to enter the city, like Venice will do for day-trippers. Others are limiting how many cruise ships can stop in their ports. Some cities are also encouraging visitors to go to less famous areas, away from the main attractions, to spread out the crowds.

Locals often complain about noise, rubbish, and high prices caused by tourism. They also worry about losing their local culture. So, these new rules and ideas are trying to find a balance. The goal is to let people enjoy these beautiful places but also protect them for the future and make sure local residents can live comfortably.`;
