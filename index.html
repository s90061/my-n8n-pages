            <h1>Artist Lee Mingwei's Exhibition in Sweden Invites People to Create Shared Memories</h1>
            <p>Artist Lee Mingwei's special show called "Best Regards, Lee Mingwei" started on September 26th in Sweden. It was part of the "MalmÃ¶ Gallery Weekend" at the Moderna Museet MalmÃ¶. People in the city could join in and experience his art. His art uses "invitation" as a way for everyone to help make shared memories.</p>
            <p>Lee Mingwei was born in Taiwan. He studied art at Yale University and now lives in Paris, New York, and Taipei. His art looks at ideas like trust, being close to others, and knowing yourself. His work has been shown in famous museums around the world, like the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>
            <p>This time, the Moderna Museet MalmÃ¶ in Sweden invited Lee Mingwei. His show "Best Regards, Lee Mingwei" opened during the "MalmÃ¶ Gallery Weekend" and will stay open until January 11, 2026.</p>
            <p>The exhibition is in the museum's Turbine Hall. The museum planned many activities, like an opening event, guided tours with the curator, and workshops for families. This allowed people to join in and experience the art that uses "invitation" as its main idea.</p>
            <p>Elisabeth Millqvist, who is the branch director and curator, planned this exhibition. It mainly shows three of Lee Mingwei's well-known interactive works: "The Letter Writing Project" (started in 1998), "Fabric of Memory" (started in 2006), and "The Mending Project" (started in 2009). The exhibition will also show videos of other works, such as "Our Labyrinth" (2017), "Sound of Bloom" (2013), and "Guernica in Sand" (2006).</p>
            <p>The curator said that the artworks will grow and change throughout the exhibition. This will happen as people from the city join in. The museum also invited people and volunteers from MalmÃ¶ to help write this "collective book" together.</p>
            <p>For many years, Lee Mingwei has started his art with an "invitation." He changes everyday actions into special events. By writing, mending, talking, and giving, he helps strangers meet in open situations. His art changes over time and with the people who join, making the exhibition space a place for talking and thinking deeply. This way of making art, based on "giving and responding," is often called a "gentle but strong" way of looking at relationships.</p>
            <p>The first of the three interactive works shown is "The Letter Writing Project." It has three letter rooms that are partly see-through and quiet. In these rooms, people can write letters to say thank you, apologize, or say goodbye to someone they never spoke to. They can also read letters that others have left open. This helps people feel a sense of peace.</p>
            <p>"Fabric of Memory" asks people in Sweden to give fabrics or clothes that hold family or personal memories. They also write stories about them. Visitors at the exhibition can open boxes, read the stories, and then close them again. This helps create the city's shared memories.</p>
            <p>"The Mending Project" uses sewing, colored threads, and talking. People are asked to bring clothes that need to be fixed. They sit across from someone who mends clothes and share their life stories while the sewing is done.</p>
            <p>The artist starts with his own experiences. He uses "relationships and time" as materials. People's involvement creates a network that keeps changing and flowing in different situations and at different times.</p>

            <h1>Uncovering Old Photos: Master Painter Huang Chun-pi</h1>
            <p>Huang Chun-pi was a very famous Chinese ink painter. He was known with Zhang Daqian and Pu Ru as the "Three Masters Across the Strait." He also taught for over 20 years as the head of the art department at Taiwan Provincial Normal College (now National Taiwan Normal University). He helped a lot with art education, so people called him a master of the art world.</p>
            <p>Even though he was famous for Chinese painting, Huang Chun-pi first learned Western painting. But after meeting a picture-framing shop owner, he became very interested in Chinese painting. When he was 24, Huang Chun-pi won the best prize for Chinese painting at the first art exhibition in Guangdong Province. He combined Western and Chinese painting styles, which gave his ink paintings a special look with light and color.</p>
            <p>Among Huang Chun-pi's paintings, his cloud seas and waterfalls are the most famous. This is because he loved to travel and see nature. He taught at Central University in Chongqing for many years and lived by the Jialing River. He also visited Mount Emei many times. There, he learned about the true spirit of mountains and rivers from nature.</p>
            <p>In 1949, Huang Chun-pi came to Taiwan. He became a professor and head of the art department at Taiwan Provincial Normal College. During this time, he also sketched in places like Alishan and Taroko Gorge. In 1969, he visited Victoria Falls in South Africa when he went there for an exhibition. On his way back, he stopped in Brazil to visit Zhang Daqian and also traveled to Iguazu Falls and Niagara Falls in America. These three famous waterfalls in the world gave him ideas for many famous waterfall paintings.</p>
            <p>On September 28, 1991, the National Museum of History held a special show called "Huang Chun-pi's 95th Retrospective Exhibition." This was his last art show. During the exhibition, he passed away from pneumonia at the age of 94.</p>

            <p>LG Electronics from Korea wants to offer shares to the public for its company in India, LG Electronics India. This is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The company could be worth as much as 774 billion Indian Rupees, which is about 263.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This could be one of the biggest IPOs in India this year.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, documents released today show that the price for each share of LG Electronics India will be between 1080 and 1140 Indian Rupees. People can start buying shares for three days from October 7th. Large, important investors can buy shares one day earlier.</p>
            <p>If the shares are sold at the highest price, this IPO could raise up to 116 billion Indian Rupees for LG Electronics. LG Electronics India will not create any new shares for this IPO.</p>
            <p>LG Electronics first asked to do an IPO for its Indian company in December last year. It was planned for May this year, but it was delayed because the market was unstable.</p>
