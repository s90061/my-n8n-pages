            <h1>Taichung Rehabilitation Association Teams Up with Companies to Donate Supplies to Families</h1>
            <p>With the Mid-Autumn Festival coming soon, the Taiwan Rehabilitation Protection Association's Taichung branch worked with the Taichung District Prosecutors Office and kind companies. Today, they held an event to help less fortunate people who have been released from prison. They bought supplies and gave them to 50 families. They hope these families feel accepted by society and can successfully return to normal life.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taichung Rehabilitation Association held a donation ceremony at the Taichung District Prosecutors Office. Important people like Prosecutor General Lin Chin-tsun from the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, Prosecutor General Chang Chieh-chin from the Taichung District Prosecutors Office, Chairman Liao Hsueh-tsung of the Taichung Rehabilitation Association, Secretary-General Nieh Bi-ying of the Taichung City Red Cross, and Deputy General Manager Li Li-shu of Longde Real Estate Development Company were all there.</p>
            <p>Chang Chieh-chin said at the meeting that to help people released from prison get back into society, they support selling products made by these people and their farm produce. This time, they used money from deferred prosecution fines from the Taichung District Prosecutors Office to buy pomelo gift boxes from "Shallow Forest Farm." These boxes were then donated. He hopes this will make more people want to buy products from former prisoners. He also thanked the companies for buying supplies to help 50 less fortunate families of former prisoners.</p>
            <p>Liao Hsueh-tsung explained that to follow the Ministry of Justice's policy of "former prisoners helping former prisoners," the association actively supports businesses started by successful former prisoners. They buy supplies from these businesses and give them to less fortunate families. He hopes that these public service events will make families of former prisoners feel accepted and warm, strengthen their family support systems, and help them return to society smoothly.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Woman Attacked in London Worries Memory Loss After Trauma Will Affect Police Statement</h1>
            <p>A Taiwanese woman was attacked by several people without reason in London recently. Ms. Chen, the victim, told CNA today that because of severe mental trauma, her memory of the event is becoming unclear. However, the police could only make time to take her statement five days later.</p>
            <p>Chen Ying-ting, who was attacked for no reason, said in an interview that she tries her best every day to remember and write down details. This is to get ready for her police interview on the 25th. Someone from the Taiwan Representative Office in the UK will also be with her. Also, yesterday, she reported the incident on the Metropolitan Police's "Hate Crime" online reporting platform.</p>
            <p>CNA asked the Metropolitan Police today why it took several days to take a statement after the incident. They were also asked if attacks on Asian and other minority-looking residents in the Greater London area have increased recently. The police said they want to understand the situation better.</p>
            <p>Chen Ying-ting, who is 25, got her master's degree last year. She is now legally living and working in the UK with a Post-Study Work visa (PSW).</p>
            <p>She told CNA that on the evening of the 20th, she was taking a bus home. She got off near King's Cross subway station, a busy area. As she walked on the sidewalk, a girl who looked about 17 or 18 years old "purposefully" bumped into her shoulder. Another girl of a similar age behind her then loudly asked Ms. Chen, "Why did you bump into my friend?"</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen said there were four people in the group. They all looked like teenagers and were white females. To stop them from causing more trouble, Ms. Chen apologized. But instead, she was badly beaten. Even when Ms. Chen was on the ground, the four girls continued to kick and punch her. Then, they pulled her hair and hit her head against a wall.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen told CNA that she was very scared at that moment and only thought about protecting herself as much as possible. But she remembers a young couple, about 30 years old, came forward and tried to stop the teenagers verbally. They then contacted the police.</p>
            <p>According to what Ms. Chen's roommate, who arrived later, said, the couple almost cried when they told the roommate what happened. The couple said they avoided physically stopping the teenagers who were attacking Ms. Chen because the attackers were female. If there was physical contact, the couple might be accused themselves.</p>
            <p>However, the couple described that the girls hit Ms. Chen's head against the wall very violently. Ms. Chen's hair was pulled out and scattered on her legs and on the ground. But the girls did not seem to want to stop. "It was as if they wanted to kill her (Ms. Chen)," so they decided to step in and stop them.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen told CNA, "If there had been a glass bottle on the ground (to smash her head with) or nails on the wall, I might not be able to talk like this (be interviewed) today."</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen said what made her sad was that the bus she was on had not yet left. After the attack, she and the bus driver looked at each other. She loudly asked the driver to call the police for help. But the driver quietly closed the door and drove away. The driver was a white man.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen said that after the incident, she contacted her roommates from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Her roommates arrived at the scene in about 30 minutes. But the police did not appear even an hour after being called.</p>
            <p>Her roommates called the police again. According to her roommates, the police meant that if the situation was "not very serious" or "there was no immediate danger to life," officers would not come to the scene. But the police had already gotten Ms. Chen's phone number from her roommates.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen later took an Uber to the emergency room by herself. At the emergency room, Ms. Chen finally got a call from the police. This was almost 3 hours after the incident.</p>
            <p>The police said that officers would not go to the hospital. But if Ms. Chen wanted to make a statement, she had to make an appointment. Because many people were waiting, Ms. Chen could only go to the police station to make a statement on the morning of the 25th at the earliest.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen left the hospital the same day and is now resting at home. The doctor told her to watch for symptoms like vomiting, which might mean a concussion.</p>
            <p>In London, there have been several anti-illegal immigration protests in recent weeks. In the middle of this month, a large protest with an estimated 110,000 people took place. One of the main figures was Tommy Robinson, a far-right leader who has been convicted of crimes.</p>
            <p>Elon Musk, an American tech billionaire who has recently been commenting on British politics and society, spoke to the crowd at the rally. He criticized "uncontrolled immigration" and said, "Whether you choose violence or not, violence will find you. You either fight back or you die." The British Prime Minister's office criticized Mr. Musk's comments.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen's roommates have lived in the UK for 7 or 8 years but said this was their first time experiencing something like what happened to Ms. Chen.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen told CNA that when she is in the UK, she always avoids "strange people." If there is a big march in the city, she usually does not even go out. She did not expect that even though she tried hard to avoid trouble, she was still attacked without any reason.</p>

            <h1>Financial Supervisory Commission Plans to Relax Standards for Margin Trading on OTC Stocks; Around 40 Companies Expected to Benefit</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said today that it is looking at changing rules related to the "Standards for Margin Trading of Securities." This change will make the standards for margin trading of Over-The-Counter (OTC) stocks the same as for listed stocks. Three conditions will be removed: how long a company has been established, its total capital, and its profit rules. Based on data from the end of August, about 40 more OTC stocks will be allowed for margin trading. These new rules are expected to start by the end of the year.</p>
            <p>Huang Chung-hao, Chief Secretary of the FSC Securities and Futures Bureau, said that this change follows a suggestion from the Taipei Exchange (TPEx). They are now announcing the proposed changes to Articles 2, 4, and 5 of the "Standards for Margin Trading of Securities." There will be a 30-day period for public feedback.</p>
            <p>Huang Chung-hao explained that currently, OTC companies must meet certain rules for margin trading. These include being established for at least 3 years, having capital of at least NT$300 million, and not having past losses (small companies must also have profits of at least 3% of their capital). However, listed companies do not have these rules. This time, the FSC will remove these three conditions.</p>
            <p>This change also fits with the current system where listed stocks that meet OTC conditions can apply to become OTC stocks. To make sure that the ability to do margin trading continues without stopping after a listed stock becomes an OTC stock, the new rules will be similar to how OTC stocks that become listed stocks are checked. It will be required that the stock's net value per share is above its face value (if the stock has no face value or its face value is not NT$10, it must not have lost money in the last fiscal year) and that ownership is not too concentrated. If these conditions are met, the stock can be used for margin trading.</p>
            <p>Huang Chung-hao pointed out that it is not common for listed companies to become OTC companies. However, companies on the "Innovation Board," which are part of the listed company group, often become OTC companies.</p>
            <p>Based on the FSC's calculations using data from the end of August, 721 companies currently have stocks that can be used for margin trading. After these rules are relaxed, about 40 more OTC companies' stocks are expected to become eligible for margin trading. When asked which 40 companies these would be, Huang Chung-hao said that because the rules will not start for some time, the conditions might change. The exact list of companies will be clearer after the rules are officially announced.</p>
