**U.S. House of Representatives Unanimously Passes "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act", Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

The U.S. House of Representatives on June 23 orally and unanimously passed the bipartisan "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act." This act instructs the U.S. to use its voice and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's participation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including its involvement in economic oversight, access to technical assistance, and the eligibility of Taiwanese personnel to serve in the IMF. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) today (June 24) stated that this bill holds positive significance for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and counteracting China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA will closely monitor the future developments of this bill.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," which calls on the U.S. executive branch to assist Taiwan's participation in the IMF, was proposed and passed by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in March this year, and then orally passed by the full House unanimously on June 23. The bill was jointly introduced by Republican Representative Young Kim and Democratic Representative Al Green.

Representative Kim stated that China continues to obstruct Taiwan's participation in international forums such as the IMF because it understands that financial security is as crucial as military security. China could potentially disrupt Taiwan's financial system by raising tariffs, short-selling stocks, or freezing bank transfers. Joining the IMF would provide Taiwan with resources to strengthen its financial resilience and resist China's economic coercion.

In response, MOFA Spokesperson Joanne Ou stated at a regular press conference this morning that this bill holds positive significance for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and counteracting China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA thanked the U.S. House of Representatives for unanimously passing this bill, which not only fully demonstrates the firm support of bipartisan U.S. congressional members for Taiwan's participation in international organizations and expansion of international space, but also further highlights the importance of strengthening Taiwan's economic resilience and global partnerships.

MOFA stated that it will closely monitor the future developments of this bill and will maintain close coordination and communication with U.S. congressional friends and the executive branch to continuously enhance and accumulate positive momentum for Taiwan's international participation.

Regarding this "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," after its passage by the U.S. House of Representatives on June 23, it must pass an identical version in the U.S. Senate and then be signed by the President to officially become law. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee already passed a counterpart bill in early June, awaiting a full Senate vote.

**SEMICON Taiwan Upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week"**

<a href="https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/semicon-taiwan-%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8E%E9%AB%94%E9%81%8A-201000087.html">News Link</a>

The global semiconductor industry's annual event, "SEMICON Taiwan 2025," officially commenced on June 17. Marking its 30th anniversary, SEMI, the International Semiconductor Industry Association, announced that the exhibition will be fully upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week." Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the US-China tech war, with Trump pressing allies to bring companies back with high tariffs, major manufacturers like TSMC face even greater pressure to invest in the US. In the future, semiconductor companies will be forced to "pick sides," and supply chains will accelerate regional reorganization. Semiconductors have shifted from being commercial goods to strategic assets, with decision-making moving from "market efficiency" to "national security resilience."

With "Leading with Collaboration. Innovating with the World." as the theme for SEMICON Taiwan 2025, this year marks the debut of International Semiconductor Week. Key international forums will be held on September 8th and 9th, followed by the exhibition from September 10th to 12th. Cao Shi-lun, SEMI Global Chief Marketing Officer and President of SEMI Taiwan, stated that in the first quarter of 2025, global semiconductor equipment shipments reached $32.05 billion, a 21% year-on-year increase, mainly driven by the growing demand for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and edge computing applications, showing strong growth momentum.

However, he also stated that the industry faces challenges like supply chain restructuring and geopolitical issues. The US government is using methods such as equipment embargoes (ASML), talent cut-offs (US experts), and supply chain decoupling, forcing companies to "pick a side." Semiconductor industry professionals believe that with accelerated regional reorganization of supply chains, they need to re-evaluate production and investment plans to deal with policy risks and geopolitical uncertainties.

Regarding ongoing semiconductor tariffs, relevant industry players noted that according to Section 232 of the Commerce Department's regulations, after the Commerce Secretary initiated an investigation on April 1st this year, a report must be submitted within 270 days, meaning it will be released by December 27th at the latest. The US President then has 90 days after receiving the report to make a decision, which means the semiconductor tariff deadline will fall around March 27th next year. However, the actual situation may vary due to political considerations or the complexity of the investigation.

Diversifying operations is the best approach. TSMC, as the leading wafer foundry, is increasing its investment in the US to meet customer demand. Industry players stated that geopolitical factors are driving supply chain independence, which helps support demand for semiconductor equipment. In addition, the demand from AI/HPC applications is driving the adoption of advanced manufacturing processes (GAA), the growth of HBM demand, and the development of advanced packaging technologies, which will also increase investment in semiconductor equipment.
