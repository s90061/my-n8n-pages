            <h1>Miaoli Prosecutor Says Police Officer Acted in Self-Defense When Shooting Man During Domestic Violence Incident</h1>
            <p>In April, a police officer in Miaoli County shot and killed a man who was attacking his girlfriend with a knife during a domestic violence call. Today, the Miaoli District Prosecutors Office announced that the officer acted in self-defense and will not be charged.</p>
            <p>This event happened in late April this year. Police in Toufen, Miaoli County, received a report about domestic violence at an apartment building on Xinyi Road in Toufen City. When officers arrived, they found a man named Cai holding two knives. He was holding his girlfriend in the building's lobby and facing off with the police. The man did not listen to commands to drop his knives and even moved closer to the police. An officer then shot him, and he later died in the hospital.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli District Prosecutors Office released a statement today. It said that a Toufen police officer shot a man during a domestic violence call, which led to the man's death. The family of the man who died filed a complaint accusing the officer of causing death by accident during the investigation.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that the prosecutor in charge looked at videos, examined the body, visited the crime scene, compared bullet paths, questioned people who were there, and checked information from security cameras. After all these investigations, they decided that when the police arrived at the scene, the man was still attacking the victim of domestic violence with a knife. So, the officer fired two shots according to Article 4, Paragraph 4, Subparagraph 1 of the Police Weapons Use Act.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors also said that when the officer fired the second shot, the situation was urgent. It was hard to know if the man's knife had dropped from his hand. Also, based on the bullet path simulation, it could not be ruled out that the officer aimed at the man's leg. Therefore, the officer's actions were considered self-defense and legal.</p>
            <p>After the prosecutor finished the investigation, they decided there was not enough evidence to charge the officer. So, they dropped the charges according to Article 252, Subparagraph 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>

            <h1>Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan Reach Men's Doubles Semifinals at BWF Korea Open</h1>
            <p>At the BWF Super 500 Korea Open, Taiwan's men's doubles team, Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan, who are ranked 13th in the world, won their quarterfinal match today. They beat South Korea's team Cho Song-hyun and Jin Sung-min with scores of 21-15 and 21-18. This is the first time this season they have reached the semifinals.</p>
            <p>Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan are Taiwan's top men's doubles team. The last time they reached the semifinals of a BWF Super Series tournament was at last year's Taipei Open, where they won the championship. After that, Yang Po-hsuan had problems with a wrist injury, which made their performance uneven. Now, they have finally made a breakthrough at the Korea Open. It has been over a year since they last reached the men's doubles semifinals in a Super Series tournament.</p>
            <p>Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan were the 5th seeds in this competition. After winning their first two matches against other Taiwanese teams, they played against the South Korean team Cho Song-hyun and Jin Sung-min in the quarterfinals today. Cho and Jin are ranked outside the top 200 in the world. This was the first time these two teams played each other. It's important to know that Cho Song-hyun and Jin Sung-min had beaten the Chinese team Chen Bo-yang and Liu Yi, who are ranked 9th in the world, in the first round, showing they are strong players.</p>
            <p>When the first game started, Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan did not seem new to playing together for the first time. They quickly took an 8-1 lead with strong attacks. Even after a short break, they continued to get more points. They controlled the game so well that their opponents could not fight back, and they easily won the first game 21-15.</p>
            <p>After winning the first game and getting close to winning the match, Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan had a difficult time in the second game. They lost a 5-point lead and were behind. However, the experienced Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan managed to calm down and play well at the end of the game. When the score was 18-18, they scored 3 points in a row to win the match and get their spot in the men's doubles semifinals.</p>
            <p>After the match, Lee Jhe-huei told the Central News Agency that the main thing was to control the speed of the game and avoid making unnecessary mistakes. He also said that this week, they were not so rushed when hitting the shuttlecock. "Other things just happened naturally, we didn't think too much," he added.</p>
