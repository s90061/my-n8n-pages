            <h1>Cheng Li-wen Runs for KMT Leader, Wang Jin-pyng Gives Her 3 Points of Advice</h1>
            <p>The Kuomintang (KMT) will choose its new leader on October 18. Cheng Li-wen, who is running for this position, met with the former head of the Legislative Yuan, Wang Jin-pyng, yesterday. Today, she said that Wang Jin-pyng was very kind and thoughtful. He gave her many good ideas and cared about her election. He wrote down three important points of advice and hopes for her. He believes her ability to explain ideas and her fighting spirit are exactly what the KMT needs right now.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen shared on Facebook this morning that she had visited Wang Jin-pyng twice before deciding to run for party leader to ask for his advice. Yesterday, she visited him again just for the election. As always, Wang Jin-pyng was very kind and cared about her election. He offered many valuable ideas, and she learned a lot from him.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen said that Wang Jin-pyng always cares deeply about peace between Taiwan and China, the country's development, and harmony in society. Because of this, he has strong hopes for the future of the KMT and the responsibilities of the party leader. To show his serious thoughts, Wang Jin-pyng wrote down three points of advice and expectations for her and gave them to her personally.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen explained that Wang Jin-pyng's three points were: "First, the people are the most important. Those in power should not decide for the people; instead, the people decide, and we do the work." "Second, the KMT has been getting weaker for many years. We need to look at why the party's own culture has problems, making people not accept us. So, the new KMT leader must change the party's culture and create a fresh start to meet what the people expect."</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen said, "Third, he supports my ability to speak clearly and my strong fight, but he also said that after becoming leader, I must serve everyone and bring all people in society together. So, we need to be peaceful and bring good fortune." Wang Jin-pyng strongly believes that her ability to explain things and her fighting spirit are what the KMT needs most now. At the same time, he reminded her to "be peaceful and bring good fortune." He said that in the future, when she becomes the leader, she must not only unite the whole party but also think about uniting all of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen stated that Wang Jin-pyng kept saying that people inside Taiwan should not continue to be divided and against each other. The KMT must unite Taiwan to successfully achieve peace between Taiwan and China. Both inside Taiwan and across the Taiwan Strait, there must be "peace and good fortune," which will benefit everyone.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen expressed that Wang Jin-pyng's careful thought and high goals deeply touched her, and she feels a great responsibility. She truly thanks Wang Jin-pyng for his support and help. She will remember his advice very well and will not let him down. She promised to work very hard day and night, giving her best for the party and the people.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Floods Cause Damage, CPC Says Guangfu Gas Station Is Open Again</h1>
            <p>Hualien suffered from floods when the Mataian Stream overflowed. CPC (Taiwan's state-owned oil company) has continued to send people and machines to clean up and fix two gas stations it owns in Guangfu Township. After the Mataian station reopened on the afternoon of September 27, the Guangfu station in the town center also started working again this morning. It can now provide fuel for disaster relief vehicles and for people in need.</p>
            <p>CPC shared in a press release that the Guangfu station worked with the army to clean up nearby streets. On September 29, they finished cleaning the station area and checking its equipment. In the evening, they took samples of the oil. On the morning of September 30, they received the test results, which showed that the fuel (92 unleaded gasoline, 95 unleaded gasoline, and super diesel) was all good.</p>
            <p>CPC said that after many strict steps and tests, the Guangfu station reopened at 8 AM today. Both of Taiwan CPC's gas stations in Guangfu Township are now fully open and supplying fuel. This meets the needs of disaster relief efforts and the local people.</p>

            <h1>Foreign Ministry and Poland's CoD Sign Agreement, Lin Chia-lung Says Democracy Will Shine</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and a group from Warsaw, Poland called the "Community of Democracies" (CoD), signed an agreement yesterday. Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung was there to see it happen. He said that being democratic and free is part of Taiwan's identity. Taiwan will keep working with countries that think like it, so that democracy can grow strong everywhere in the world.</p>
            <p>MOFA announced this morning that Lin Chia-lung led a group to Poland. On September 30, he visited the CoD's main office and met with its Secretary-General, Mantas Adomenas. He also saw MOFA and CoD sign an agreement to work together. They promised to create a way to work on making democracies stronger, stopping false information from other countries, protecting human rights, and helping people join in society. This shows how friendly and united democratic countries are.</p>
            <p>Minister Lin said that democracy and freedom are important to Taiwan. This agreement shows that both sides share the same values and believe that protecting democracy is key to keeping global peace and making the world better. Adomenas said that signing this agreement starts a new chapter for their cooperation. He believes Taiwan and Central Europe are important places for defending democracy, and he praised Taiwan as a good example of democracy in the 21st century.</p>
            <p>MOFA pointed out that Lin Chia-lung's trip shows that Taiwan and Europe are not only democratic friends but also excellent partners in business and technology. Taiwan is a reliable democratic partner and a very important part of the world's supply chains. Taiwan will work with Europe to create good things based on "value diplomacy" and build a future with democracy and success.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung posted on Facebook this morning that he was happy to meet Adomenas again, who used to be Lithuania's Vice Foreign Minister and is an old friend of Taiwan. Lin had met him before during a visit to Poland last year.</p>
            <p>Lin remembered that Adomenas received an award in 2024 for his important help during the pandemic. He helped Lithuania give over 250,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan and also helped Taiwan set up an office in Lithuania under the name "Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung spoke about his own experience in a student movement when he was at university. He said that democracy is not just an idea; it is something that people bravely fought for and sacrificed for every day. He noted that powerful countries like China and Russia are now helping each other, spreading their way of ruling that does not allow freedom. Also, in the war between Russia and Ukraine, China pretends to be neutral but actually supports Russia. Because of this, it is especially important for Taiwan and CoD to work together to promote democracy.</p>
            <p>Lin emphasized that Taiwan will continue to work side by side with countries that have similar beliefs. They will help democracy grow everywhere in the world and unite to work for freedom and prosperity around the globe.</p>
