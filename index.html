            <h1>Shezi Island Land Purchase Meeting Begins, Opposing and Supporting Groups Shout Outside</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taipei City Government held its first meeting to discuss buying land on Shezi Island. Groups who are against the plan and groups who support it were outside the meeting, shouting at each other. The Shezi Island Self-Help Association asked for the land purchase process to stop. The Shezi Island Development Promotion Association, which supports the plan, said that the land purchase could make life better for people there.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Land Development Office held the first "Shezi Island District Expropriation Case" land purchase meeting in Shilin, Shezi Island, this morning. There will be more meetings until September 20th. The Land Development Office said the meetings are to help landowners understand the development plan and the land purchase process.</p>
            <p>The Shezi Island Self-Help Association held a press conference outside the meeting. They gave a statement saying they "oppose the toxic Shezi Island plan and want to stop the land purchase process." They said the city government is ignoring court decisions and what local people want by continuing the Shezi Island land purchase plan.</p>
            <p>The Shezi Island Self-Help Association's statement said that the current city government is continuing the previous government's plan to push the "Eco-Shezi Island" project. This has affected the rights of the residents. They repeated that they are against the land purchase. They want the building ban to be lifted, for people to rebuild their homes where they are now, and for the nine main communities to stay completely.</p>
            <p>Yu Yi-chia, the secretary-general of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, who supports the Shezi Island Self-Help Association, said that residents are not against development, but believe that the basic services, which have been ignored for a long time, should be improved first. If the city government expands the land purchase, the Shezi Island project could cost more than 200 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The Shezi Island Residents' Rights Promotion Association, which supports the development, also came to present their petition and shared a statement from residents. They said that building on Shezi Island has been banned for 56 years. According to city statistics from early May last year, about 98% of Shezi Island landowners agree to the land purchase. They questioned if the opposing groups were truly local residents.</p>
            <p>The Shezi Island Residents' Rights Promotion Association believes that Shezi Island does not have enough basic services. They think that the city government's land purchase plan will bring public services at the same time. This will improve the quality of life and the environment for local people.</p>
            <p>The Shezi Island Promotion Association said that the agreement on price is an early step in the land purchase process. They said the city government has already explained that they will hold public hearings for the project plan and get approval from the Ministry of Interior. They support the city government continuing with the land purchase process as the law requires.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Land Development Office sent out a press release. They said that they are following the law for the land purchase process. Before the environmental assessment lawsuit for Shezi Island is finished, the results of the environmental assessment review are still valid. According to Article 11 of the Land Expropriation Act, the land purchase is legal and follows the rules.</p>
            <p>The Land Development Office said that to improve the levees and solve drainage problems on Shezi Island, they need to build public facilities and provide basic services. This is how they can improve the lives of local residents. They will work hard to complete the overall development of Shezi Island.</p>

            <h1>President: To Help More Women Work, Families with Only 1 Child May Soon Hire Domestic Helpers</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te spoke in an interview with the media. He said that the ruling party will start "four adjustments" to help society rest and get better. The government will keep working on raising salaries, cutting taxes, and giving more benefits. They will be brave in solving what society needs. He also told the Legislative Yuan to "put people's needs first and politics second."</p>
            <p>President Lai was interviewed by "Liberty Times" newspaper, and the interview was published today. The interview covered topics like raising workers' salaries, tax cuts, Long-Term Care 3.0, helping more women join the workforce, dealing with tariffs and how businesses react, talks between political parties, the "U.S. doubt theory," and relations with China.</p>
            <p>For economic growth, the President said they will focus on three new areas. First, they will help small and medium businesses deal with the effects of matching tariffs from the US. Second, they will help these businesses change and use digital tools and reach zero emissions. Third, they will help traditional industries combine and become more competitive. They will also use the "Taiwan Sovereign Fund" to invest in or buy international sales channels, so traditional products can be sold worldwide.</p>
            <p>The President said that the basic wage was adjusted every year when former President Tsai Ing-wen was in office. He has continued to raise it since he became President. He also raised salaries for government workers and soldiers. He asks companies that want to be listed on the stock market to pay new employees a certain amount. In the future, he hopes the Ministry of Labor will make new rules. When companies apply to hire foreign workers, they must first raise the salaries of their local employees to a certain level before they can get approval.</p>
            <p>Talking about tax cuts, the President said that next year, young people who earn less than 620,000 New Taiwan Dollars a year will not have to pay tax. For a family of four with two children under 5, if their yearly income is less than 1,641,000 New Taiwan Dollars, they will not pay tax. If they also support two older family members, and their yearly income is over 2,000,000 New Taiwan Dollars, they still won't pay tax. Right now, almost half of the people in Taiwan do not pay tax. Instead, the top 1% earners pay almost half of all taxes. The government is always trying to make the difference between rich and poor smaller.</p>
            <p>The President said that the government is promoting Long-Term Care 3.0. At the same time, he encourages Premier Cho Jung-tai to work hard to solve society's needs. For example, to help more women join the workforce, they need to solve problems that stop them. So, in the future, families with only one child may be able to hire domestic helpers. This is a brave way to solve important issues that society needs.</p>
            <p>About matching tariffs, the President said that the technical agreements and discussions are already finished. Now they are waiting for the final general meeting. Investing in Alaska was planned a long time ago for energy security. Later, because the US government invited them and because of tariff talks, the government did say they were willing to invest in Alaska.</p>
            <p>When asked about the "U.S. doubt theory," the President said that after US President Trump took office, the help given to Taiwan in areas like diplomacy and defense did not stop or decrease. Instead, it continued to grow stronger. He said people should feel confident once they understand this clearly.</p>
            <p>Regarding China's "grey zone" harassment, the President said that national security agencies have already created a list of Chinese oil tankers, cargo ships that took part in military drills, or ships that have cut underwater cables. These ships are being watched closely. The government will also soon propose seven laws and seven sub-laws to protect underwater cables. The Executive Yuan is currently discussing these.</p>
            <p>The President said that China should not ignore Taiwan's goodwill. He really hopes China will open its hand. He quoted a saying: "If you have a hammer in your hand, everything looks like a nail." But if you have an olive branch, you can clearly see the goodwill of the Taiwanese people. He believes that if China respects the fact that the Republic of China exists and respects what the people of Taiwan want, many problems can be solved easily.</p>
            <p>When asked about the "echo chamber effect," the President said he encourages himself and his cabinet to change how they do things. First, responses must be quick. Second, they must be broad and reach different groups of people. Third, they must go deep into local communities. Fourth, they must use technology well. Fifth, leaders must be on the front lines to defend policies and go to local areas. They must explain misunderstandings in person to be effective.</p>
            <p>Regarding relations between political parties, the President said he hopes that the official system can work again, meaning that the procedures of the "Legislative Yuan's Powers Act" can meet legal requirements. Second, he really hopes that talks between parties can work well, so that the ideas of different parties can be put into practice. Third, the Premier should have a direct way to talk with the opposition parties and even with Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu. Everyone should "put people's needs first and political fights second."</p>
