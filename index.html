            <h1>World University Games: Taiwan Women's Archery Team Gets Silver After Losing to Japan</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 25 (CNA) â€“ Today, the women's recurve archery team gold medal match was held at the World University Games in Germany. Taiwan's team, with members Kuo Tzu-ying, Li Tsai-hsuan, and Feng Yu-chu, played against Japan. Taiwan did not play well in the last two rounds and lost 2-6, earning another silver medal for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's recurve archery team did not play in the first round. In the top 16, they beat Italy 5-4. In the top 8, they easily beat India 5-1. In the semi-finals, they won against China 5-3, moving on to the gold medal match.</p>
            <p>Before the game started today, the temperature was low. In the first round, the Taiwan women's team started strongly. With Feng Yu-chu's last arrow scoring 10 points, they won by a small margin of 56-55. This gave them a 2-0 lead in points, starting the game well.</p>
            <p>However, in the second round, the Taiwan team lost 54-56. The game changed in the third round. It started raining, and the wind became stronger. This directly affected how the Taiwan team performed.</p>
            <p>In the third round, Kuo Tzu-ying still shot a 10-point arrow. But then, Li Tsai-hsuan and Feng Yu-chu scored 9 and 8 points, respectively. When it was Kuo Tzu-ying's turn again, she surprisingly shot a 7-point arrow. In the end, they lost that round 52-58.</p>
            <p>In the important fourth round, the Taiwan women's team had to win to get a chance for an extra round. But their first three arrows scored 8, 8, and 7 points, which caused them to lose. They lost to Japan again, 52-56. The final score was 2-6, and they took home a silver medal.</p>
            <p>Japan's performance was steady. In all four rounds, their scores were above 55 points. Uehara Ruka, who was the first shooter, hit 10 points with all 8 of her arrows in the four rounds. Four of these arrows hit the very center of the target, which was amazing.</p>
            <p>In the World University Games women's recurve archery team event, Taiwan won its only gold medal in 2015 at the Gwangju World University Games. Lin Shih-chia, who was part of that team, is now the coach for this year's women's team. It's a pity they could not win gold again this time.</p>
            <p>Also, in the men's recurve archery team bronze medal match, Taiwan's team, led by Kuo Yu-cheng, Tang Chih-chun, and Su Yu-yang, unfortunately lost 0-6 to Turkey. They finished in fourth place.</p>

            <h1>Chan Tzu-Hsien Wins MVP After Son's Birth, Jokes "Ultraman" Has Also Gotten Better</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 25 (CNA) â€“ Chan Tzu-Hsien from CTBC Brothers baseball team has been lucky "after his son was born." Today, he hit 3 times and got 2 RBIs in one game, helping his team win 5-0 against Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions. It was also the Lions' "Ultraman" themed day. Chan Tzu-Hsien joked that the "Ultraman" he knew as a child has also gotten better.</p>
            <p>The Brothers team played against the Lions at Taipei Dome today. Chan Tzu-Hsien made 3 hits and 2 RBIs, and he was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the game. His son "Yilu" was born on the evening of July 21. He laughed and said he felt lucky "after his son was born," and his mood also improved. But he thinks the MVP award should go to shortstop Chiang Kun-yu. He said, "Kun-yu saved many balls. Good defense is always important for the Brothers team."</p>
            <p>Chan Tzu-Hsien said he knew the Lions had an "Ultraman" themed day and had won 11 games in a row before today's game. But he also said that just like the Brothers' "Cooling Festival," even strong teams can still lose. He did not think about the opponent and focused on doing what he needed to do in the game.</p>
            <p>Chan Tzu-Hsien shared that he only found out his cheering song came from "Ultraman" a few years after he started playing professional baseball. He also laughed and said that as a child, he used to call him "Salted Egg Ultraman." He joked that "Salted Egg Ultraman" has even gotten better. He also joked that he hasn't paid close attention, so some characters' appearances have changed so much that he can't tell who the bad guys are.</p>
            <p>When asked if he remembered any cartoons from his childhood, Chan Tzu-Hsien said he watched "Anpanman" in the mornings. In the afternoons, after school, "Dragon Ball" and "The Powerpuff Girls" would be on. But his parents controlled how much TV he watched, so he didn't watch a lot. He said, "That's why my eyes are so healthy."</p>

            <h1>Brandon Leibrandt Gets First Win, Brothers Team Ends Lions' "Ultraman" Undefeated Record</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 25 (CNA) â€“ Today, the CTBC Brothers team won 5-0 against Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions. This win was thanks to Brandon Leibrandt, who pitched 6 innings without letting the other team score, and Chan Tzu-Hsien, who made 3 hits and got 2 RBIs. This ended the Lions' undefeated record on their "Ultraman" theme day. Brothers' head coach, Hirano Keiichi, laughed and said that Ultraman was on the Brothers' side today.</p>
            <p>The Brothers team played the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions today at the Taipei Dome. It was the first game of the Lions' "Ultraman" theme day, and 17,711 people came to watch. Before today's game, the Lions had won 11 straight games on their "Ultraman" theme days and had not lost.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 2nd inning, Chan Tzu-Hsien got the first hit for the Brothers. After two players were out, Tseng Sung-en hit to score the first run. In the top of the 3rd inning, Kao Yu-chieh got a walk. Chang Ren-wei hit a ground ball that caused the Lions to make a defensive error. Chiang Kun-yu got a hit, and then with two players out, Chan Tzu-Hsien hit again, bringing in 2 more runs in one play.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 6th inning, the Brothers started to score again. After two players were out, Sung Sheng-jui got a walk, and Chang Ren-wei hit a double, adding another important run for the team. In the top of the 9th inning, after one player was out, Chang Ren-wei got a walk, and Chiang Kun-yu was hit by a pitch, getting on base. Wang Wei-chen, who came in to bat, got a hit that brought in a run.</p>
            <p>Brothers' starting pitcher, Brandon Leibrandt, threw 96 pitches in total for 6 innings today. He allowed 4 hits, made 5 strikeouts, and gave 2 walks. He did not let the other team score any runs and won his first game in his CPBL career. Brothers' player Chan Tzu-Hsien made 3 hits and 2 RBIs in the game and was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP).</p>
            <p>After the game, Brothers' head coach, Hirano Keiichi, said that he knew the Lions had won 11 straight games on their theme day before this game. He added, "But today, Ultraman was on our side. I really like him, so we couldn't lose today."</p>
            <p>Before today, Brandon Leibrandt had lost 2 of his 3 starting games. Today, he pitched well for 6 innings and got the win. Hirano Keiichi said that Leibrandt had some things to work on before, like how to attack batters and how to use his special pitches and fastballs. He said he couldn't share all the details. Today, Leibrandt's fastball was not very fast, but he did well by changing speeds to confuse batters, making it hard for them to hit the ball well.</p>
            <p>Hirano Keiichi also mentioned that in Asian baseball, teams use quick movements to put pressure on pitchers. Today, Brandon Leibrandt was able to stop the Lions' plans well. He felt that Leibrandt was thinking about what kind of pitcher he wanted to become.</p>
