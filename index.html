            <h1>Trump: New Trade Deals Coming, Tariffs for Over 150 Countries</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., July 16, CNA correspondent Hou Tzu-Ying) US President Donald Trump has been announcing new tariff rates for more than 20 countries. Taiwan is not on this list. Today, he said that "some good agreements will be announced," and India might be one of them. He also said he will send tariff letters directly to over 150 other countries that are not talking with the US.</p>
            <p>In early April, Trump started his tariff policy. He put tariffs of 11% to 50% on many countries. Then, he gave them a 90-day break to talk with the US. Last week, he signed an order to make this break longer until August 1. He also started sending letters to leaders of many countries. These letters tell them the new tariff rates starting on August 1.</p>
            <p>So far, Trump has reached agreements with the UK, Vietnam, and Indonesia. He also has a trade plan with China. Politico, a political news group, reported yesterday that Taiwan, Switzerland, and India have not yet received Trump's tariff letters. This means they might be close to reaching an agreement. These agreements could be announced in the next few weeks.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump met with Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Bahrain, at the White House. He told the media that they would talk about trade and other topics.</p>
            <p>He also said that the US has made deals with some countries, like the one with Indonesia announced yesterday. Another deal is coming soon, possibly with India.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "We will announce some good agreements."</p>
            <p>But he also said again, "Every tariff letter sent means an agreement." The best agreement is to send a letter directly. This letter tells the other country the tariffs they will pay: "30%, 35%, 25%, 20%." Brazil even faces a 50% tariff.</p>
            <p>Trump said that for the other over 150 countries that are not talking with the US, America will send tariff letters directly. These countries are smaller and "do not trade much with us." They will all have the same tariff rate.</p>
            <p>He said these countries are not big ones like China or Japan. The US is talking with China and Japan. But he thinks that for Japan, the US might still use tariff letters.</p>
            <p>Trump has sent four rounds of tariff letters so far. These letters went to 24 countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Canada, Brazil, and the European Union. Japan and South Korea both face 25% tariffs. Last week, Trump sent a letter to Indonesia saying they would get a 32% tariff. But yesterday, he announced a deal with Indonesia. Now, Indonesian goods sent to the US will have a 19% tariff.</p>
            <p>Regarding talks about tariffs between Taiwan and the US, Yen Hui-Hsin, a deputy trade negotiator from Taiwan's economic and trade negotiation office, said on July 16 that Taiwan wants to get a tariff rate that is not higher than its competitors, like Japan and South Korea.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Is Not Firing Powell Now, But He Is Not Saying No to It For Later</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., July 16, CNA â€“ news from other sources) US President Donald Trump said today that he does not plan to replace Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve (Fed), right now. However, Trump also said he is not ruling out any possibilities.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that US media said today that Trump has political support to fire Powell. He told a group of Republican lawmakers that he plans to replace Powell.</p>
            <p>A White House official told CNBC, a financial news channel, that "They (Republican lawmakers) agreed with firing him (Powell). The President suggested he would do it soon."</p>
            <p>When reporters asked Trump if he would replace Powell, he answered, "He has done a very bad job, but no, I'm not talking about that now." He also said, "I don't rule out anything, but I think it's very unlikely."</p>
            <p>Trump mentioned that he can, in any case, replace the Fed chairman when Powell's term ends next year.</p>

            <h1>US Media: Trump Told Lawmakers He Will Fire Fed Head Powell</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., July 16, CNA â€“ news from other sources) CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System), an American TV company, reported, using information from several people who knew directly, that President Trump asked Republican lawmakers yesterday if he should fire Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve. Some people who were there said Trump hinted that he would do this.</p>
            <p>CBS reported that sources said Trump talked about this when he met with Republican members of the House of Representatives last night. The meeting was in the Oval Office at the White House.</p>
            <p>In recent months, Trump has often said bad things about the Federal Reserve's money policy. He is angry that the Fed has not lowered interest rates.</p>
            <p>Officials at the Federal Reserve have not wanted to lower interest rates. They want to wait and see if Trump's tariffs on other countries will make prices go up again (inflation).</p>
            <p>Trump has asked Powell to leave his job. However, a president cannot fire the head of the Federal Reserve just because they disagree on money policy.</p>
