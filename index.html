            <h1>Powell Hints at Possible End to Balance Sheet Reduction, Warns of Slow Job Growth</h1>
            <p>US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted today that the Fed might soon stop reducing its balance sheet. He did not give more information about future interest rates. He also warned that job growth in the US has slowed down a lot.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a financial news channel, reported that Powell spoke at an event in Philadelphia. He talked about the progress of "quantitative tightening" (QT). This is when the Fed reduces its assets, which are currently more than 6 trillion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Powell did not say exactly when the Fed would stop QT. But he mentioned that various signs show the Fed is getting close to its goal of having "enough reserves" for the banking system.</p>
            <p>In his prepared speech, Powell said: "Our plan for a long time has been to stop reducing the balance sheet when the reserves are a little more than what we think is enough. We might reach this point in the next few months. We are watching different signs closely to make a decision."</p>
            <p>When money is tight, the Fed wants to keep bank reserves "plentiful." This helps banks have enough cash and keeps the economy running smoothly. As conditions change, the Fed's goal will change to keeping "enough" reserves, to prevent too much money from being in the market.</p>
            <p>Powell noted, "There are signs that money is slowly becoming less available." If the reserves continue to decrease, it could slow down economic growth. However, he clearly stated that the Fed does not plan to return its balance sheet to around 4 trillion US dollars, which was its size before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>Regarding future interest rates, Powell kept his recent position. He stressed that the people who make decisions are carefully watching how tight the job market is. They are trying to balance the risks between employment and inflation.</p>
            <p>He said: "The unemployment rate in August stayed low. But job growth has slowed down a lot. This could be because fewer people are joining the workforce, fewer immigrants are coming, and fewer people are looking for jobs. In a job market that is less active and a bit weaker, the risk of job losses seems to have increased."</p>
            <p>Powell mentioned that the Fed's main decision-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decided in September to lower the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to respond to this situation.</p>
            <p>People expect the Fed to cut interest rates two more times before the end of this year. Some Fed officials also agree with this idea. However, Powell did not state his opinion on this.</p>
            <p>He emphasized: "There is no policy choice without risk when we try to achieve both our employment and inflation goals." The FOMC plans to hold its next policy meeting on October 28-29.</p>

            <h1>Trump Government Raids Immigrants in Pope's Hometown, Chicago Catholics Worried</h1>
            <p>Father Brendan Curran knows many Catholic church members in Chicago who supported Donald Trump to become president again. But now, they are scared as immigration raids happen all over the city. Pope Leo XIV, who was born in Chicago, feels the same worry.</p>
            <p>Curran told Agence France-Presse (AFP), "Almost everyone is very shocked. This is definitely not what they hoped for at the start."</p>
            <p>Trump said that Chicago was like a war zone and needed armed soldiers, but this was clearly not true. Now, people are speaking out against his tough immigration rules from a more peaceful group: the Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>Pope Leo XIV, who is from Chicago and is the first American Pope ever, has always openly criticized Trump's policies. When talking about the Church's disagreement with abortion (an issue where Trump's Republican party and many Catholics agree), he mentioned "America's unkind treatment of immigrants." He asked if this could truly be called "respecting life."</p>
            <p>Chicago is the third-biggest city in the United States. About 30% of its people are from Latin American or Hispanic backgrounds, and many of them are Catholic.</p>
            <p>In Little Village, an area on Chicago's west side where most people are Latin American, Ariella Santoyo, who owns a clothing store, said that what happened after Trump took office was very different from what people hoped for.</p>
            <p>She said Trump's promises on traditional issues, especially about abortion, "brought many people" in her community to support him. But she pointed out that the arrests of immigrants, often done roughly by police officers in plain clothes with masks, were not what people expected.</p>
            <p>"We hear this from many friends and even relatives who voted for Trump: 'I never thought this would happen.'"</p>
            <p>Images of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers chasing immigrants, forcing them into vans, and spraying tear gas at people protesting made many Trump supporters happy. AFP stated that Trump won the election last year partly because he made frightening and false claims that dangerous immigrants were coming into the United States.</p>
            <p>However, among religious groups, especially Catholics, there is a growing difference of opinion with the White House.</p>
            <p>Father Curran said: "As the Church, its leaders, and its members, we have the right to talk about US immigration rules. Now, we strongly disagree with the federal policies of the White House."</p>
            <p>To show his disagreement, Pastor Gary Graf walked 1,300 kilometers from the house where Pope Leo XIV grew up to the Statue of Liberty in New York. He was protesting against Trump's policies.</p>
            <p>Last weekend, hundreds of believers walked from a Catholic church to an immigrant detention center in Broadview, a town west of Chicago, for a special religious walk. They tried to share a religious meal with the immigrants held there, but they were not able to.</p>
            <p>Dominican friar Curran said: "Our purpose as a church is in danger. When we talk about giving food to hungry people, clothes to those without, and homes to the homeless, and this is seen as a serious federal crime, then there is a problem in this country."</p>
            <p>Curran recently attended a prayer meeting outside the ICE facility in Broadview. A helicopter flew above, and about 20 Catholics gathered to pray together.</p>
            <p>One person said, "We pray that President Trump" and other US officials will "continue to be open-minded" and create kind immigration policies.</p>

            <h1>US Trade Representative: Whether to Add 100% Tariffs Depends on Beijing's Next Move</h1>
            <p>As trade problems between the United States and China continue, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in an interview today that President Trump might still add a 100% tax on Chinese goods coming to the US by November 1st, or even sooner. This will depend on what Beijing decides to do next about the rare earth dispute.</p>
            <p>Greer told the American financial news channel CNBC that "many things depend on how China acts." He also said that China was the one that chose to make the situation much worse.</p>
            <p>CNBC reported that last week, China announced many limits on how much rare earth minerals it would export. If these limits are put into action, they could seriously hurt US defense, technology, computer chip, and car industries.</p>
            <p>Greer said, "We cannot let China continue this system" where they can control the global supply chains for high technology.</p>
            <p>This new limit from Beijing was a surprise to the White House. Before this, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were planning to meet later this month during the APEC meeting in South Korea.</p>
            <p>Greer said that Trump and Xi Jinping still plan to meet. But he also suggested that these plans could change as the situation develops.</p>
            <p>Greer said, "I don't want to make any promises for us or for China about whether this meeting will happen as planned." But he believes that it is always good to talk when there is a chance.</p>
            <p>He also shared that important officials from the US and China talked yesterday in Washington about the rare earth dispute. He thinks that both sides can find a solution to this trade problem.</p>
            <p>Last week, Trump threatened to use a 100% tax in response. This was because Beijing announced it would limit its rare earth mineral exports. US news reported that this new disagreement caused American stock markets to fall. Trump even said for a short time that he might not meet with Xi Jinping. However, Trump later tried to make things calmer. The US and China also privately said they want to calm their trade disagreement, at least for a while.</p>
            <p>According to information from the International Energy Agency (IEA), China controls about 60% of all rare earth mining in the world and refines over 90% of it. Data from the US Geological Survey (USGS) shows that about 70% of the rare earth minerals imported by the US come from China.</p>
