            <h1>AI Trend Boosts Demand for Drill Bits; Apex Stock Price Nears NT$100</h1>
            <p>Because of the fast-growing need for AI and powerful computing (HPC), the technology for making circuit boards has become more difficult. This has increased the demand for drill bits, which are used to make holes in these boards. Apex, a company that makes drill bits, had its best monthly sales ever in August. Recently, Apex's stock price has gone up very quickly. Today, in early trading, the stock price reached its highest allowed level and was close to NT$100. During the day, it stayed around 5% higher, with a very large number of shares traded (over 50,000).</p>
            <p>AI servers and advanced network switches need circuit boards with more layers and better materials. This has caused a rise in the demand for high-quality drill bits. In the second quarter, Apex used more than 90% of its production capacity. High-end coated drill bits made up 45% of its sales.</p>
            <p>Apex's total sales in August were NT$389 million. This was 8.1% more than the previous month and 21.7% more than the same month last year. This was a new record for monthly sales. The total sales for the year so far are NT$2.65 billion, which is 17% more than last year.</p>
            <p>In the past month or so, Apex's stock price has almost doubled. Today, the stock opened higher and then went up and down. In early trading, it reached NT$99.2, which was the highest it could go, again close to NT$100. During the day, the price stayed about 5% higher, and over 52,000 shares were traded.</p>
            <p>Apex said that because of the quick increase in demand for AI and HPC, the materials used for circuit boards are getting better. This makes it harder for drill bits, as they need to be more resistant to wear and tear and remove chips better. Apex uses two main ways to grow: "high-performance drill bits" and "expert drilling services." They provide high-value products to meet the technical needs of server packaging and multi-layer circuit boards.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to the second half of the year, Apex stated that its main customers expect high demand. To deal with the problem of not having enough products, the company has started a plan to make more. They expect to increase the monthly production of drill bits from 31 million to 35 million by January next year. They are also planning to build more factories in 2026.</p>

            <h1>Taichung City's 2026 Budget Plan Approved; Has a Deficit of Over NT$18.3 Billion</h1>
            <p>The Taichung City Government approved its total budget plan for 2026 at a city meeting today. The city expects to receive over NT$179 billion and plans to spend over NT$197.4 billion. This means there is a deficit of over NT$18.3 billion. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said that the city will find ways to get the money needed to cover this deficit.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu also said that education will still take up the largest part of the budget. The project with the biggest increase in money is the Taichung Metro Blue Line.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu explained that some of the numbers in the budget plan are not final yet. This is the first time the Taichung City Government has sent a temporary budget plan to the Taichung City Council for approval. Many other cities and counties are doing the same thing this time.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Government's Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said that some details about money from the central government are not yet decided. They still need to combine the costs for related projects. Later, they will change the budget to include the final amounts approved by the central government. They will then give an updated report to the City Council.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's National Environmental Institute Works with Korea's Climate Center on Climate Projects</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's National Environmental Research Institute (NERI), which is part of the Ministry of Environment, signed an agreement today with the Korea Climate Change Center. In the future, they will work together on different things. These include teaching people about climate change, helping people get involved, studying climate policies, planning strategies, adapting to climate change, creating projects to reduce climate change, building skills, and sharing knowledge.</p>
            <p>Liu Tsung-yung, the head of NERI, told reporters that the Korea Climate Change Center has a lot of experience and knowledge in climate education, policy research, adaptation, and how to manage these issues. He also said that this is the first time NERI has signed an agreement with a partner from another country since it was created two years ago. It is also the first agreement with a group in Asia.</p>
            <p>Liu Tsung-yung explained that NERI and the Korea Climate Change Center will later plan and organize activities. They will start by exchanging ideas and then slowly move towards working on research projects together. Besides Korea, they also invited a representative from a Japanese environmental research institute to visit Taiwan today to share ideas. NERI hopes to work with Japan in the future as well.</p>
            <p>Liu Tsung-yung mentioned that Taiwan and the United States have been working together on environmental education for over 30 years, since NERI was part of the Environmental Protection Administration. However, in Asia, especially East Asia, managing the environment and dealing with climate change are connected. This is why this area is a main focus now.</p>
            <p>NERI is also holding an event called "Moving Towards the Future: International Forum and Symposium on Climate Change Adaptation and Environmental Governance" today and tomorrow. This event will have representatives from Taiwan's central government, as well as experts from local and international universities and research groups. They will talk about how they are moving forward with policies and what they hope to achieve in their research.</p>
            <p>Peng Chi-ming, the Minister of Environment, spoke at the start of the event. He talked about the damage caused by Typhoon Danas and the heavy rain that followed recently. He pointed out that Taiwan first faced a typhoon that landed in Chiayi, and then had heavy rain that was almost as much as Typhoon Morakot. He hopes that through different types of cooperation and discussions, they can continue to work together on adapting to climate change, managing the environment, and using resources wisely.</p>
