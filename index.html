            <h1>Typhoon Coming: Hong Kong Airport to Stay Open, But Many Flights Cancelled</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong, September 22nd â€“ A very strong typhoon named Koinu is coming close to Hong Kong. Hong Kong International Airport said today that the airport will stay open and work during the typhoon. However, many flights will be cancelled or changed tomorrow evening.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Mr. Yang Tat-wing, who is in charge of airport services, told reporters that because of the typhoon, many local flights will be cancelled or changed starting at 6 PM tomorrow. Flights on September 24th will also be affected.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Cathay Pacific will cancel 500 flights starting tomorrow. HK Express will cancel more than 100 flights. Hong Kong Airlines will cancel all of its flights.</p>
            <p>Also, the Hong Kong government is taking the typhoon Koinu very seriously. A special committee led by the Chief Secretary announced plans today to prepare for the typhoon. These plans include closing all schools (secondary schools, primary schools, special schools, kindergartens, kindergarten-cum-child care centers, and evening schools) for tomorrow and the day after.</p>
            <p>The weather office said earlier that typhoon Koinu is very large. It will pass south of Hong Kong. Even though it will not be very close to Hong Kong, its strong winds will be very dangerous for the city. They expect bad weather on September 24th, with strong winds, heavy rain, and thunder. The wind will be very strong, like a storm, at levels 8 to 9. Near the coast and on high ground, it could be even stronger, like a typhoon, at level 11. There will also be very big waves in the sea.</p>

            <h1>Germany's New Representative: Taiwan Shows That Democracy Is Important to Everyone, After Seeing Hong Kong's Freedom Shrink</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 22nd â€“ The new German representative in Taiwan, Dr. JÃ¶rg Polster, spoke to the Central News Agency. He said that Taiwan is becoming more important in many areas. Because of this, the German Institute Taipei is getting bigger. Among all German offices in the Asia-Pacific region, only the one in Taiwan is adding more staff. Dr. Polster also talked about his time working in Hong Kong. He said he saw Hong Kong's freedoms become smaller. After that, he found democratic Taiwan very inspiring, showing that democracy is important for everyone.</p>
            <p>Dr. JÃ¶rg Polster became the new German Representative in Taiwan and Director General of the German Institute Taipei in mid-August. He recently gave his first interview since coming to Taiwan to the Central News Agency. He talked about his main goals, which are to make Germany's relationship with Taiwan wider, deeper, and stronger.</p>
            <p>Dr. Polster said that even though the German Foreign Office has less money, the German Institute Taipei is still growing. Taiwan is the only place in the Asia-Pacific region where Germany is adding more staff to its office. By January next year, four new people will join, two of whom will be senior political staff. This shows how important the relationship between Germany and Taiwan is. Dr. Polster hopes this will help more people in Taiwan know about Germany.</p>
            <p>Dr. Polster explained why they are adding staff now. He said that for almost 10 years, the German Institute Taipei did not have enough people. Also, Taiwan is becoming more important in many fields like semiconductors. Both countries are working together in microelectronics, artificial intelligence (AI), and hydrogen energy, involving businesses, government, and universities. Germany has seen this and is now fixing the situation.</p>
            <p>In September 2024, two German warships sailed through the Taiwan Strait. This was the first time German navy ships had done this in 22 years. About this, Dr. Polster said that the Taiwan Strait is international water, and all countries have the right to sail there. He also said that Germany wants to keep international rules that are based on law.</p>
            <p>Dr. Polster said clearly that sailing through the Taiwan Strait should not be a problem. All countries should follow international rules. He also mentioned that Germany released its "China Strategy" in 2023. This strategy is a response to changes in the political world and is not a secret anymore. The "China Strategy" explains the dangers to peace and stability in this area, including depending too much on China. Germany's work with Taiwan fits this strategy.</p>
            <p>Dr. Polster also said that Germany wants to lower risks and have many different places to get goods from (diverse supply chains). Taiwan is a very good partner because it shares the same values as Germany: freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. Everyone knows that countries should not depend on only one country, "especially not on countries that have different ideas about international rules based on law."</p>
            <p>Before coming to Taiwan, Dr. Polster worked in Hong Kong from 2015 to 2018. During that time, he saw the end of the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. He also saw how Hong Kong's freedom and democracy became smaller.</p>
            <p>"Working in Hong Kong was very hard," Dr. Polster said sadly. When he arrived, Hong Kong still had freedom of the press, freedom to protest, freedom of speech, and some voting rights. He even met with student leaders from the Umbrella Movement. These students believed Hong Kong could be an example of democracy for China. Some students even became members of the Legislative Council.</p>
            <p>Dr. Polster said that later, these students were seen as enemies of the country. Some lawmakers lost their positions, and some were even arrested. Because of this, he could not say goodbye to these students before he left. This affected him a lot. He said he "basically saw a free society change into a society where people were afraid to use their legal freedoms."</p>
            <p>Dr. Polster said that his experience in Hong Kong helped him understand his work in Taiwan. He deeply understands that people in Taiwan see what happened in Hong Kong as a warning about "One Country, Two Systems." He saw clearly what happened in Hong Kong, and this made him want to come to Taiwan. It also helps him understand how Taiwanese people feel about Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>When asked if "One Country, Two Systems" is possible, Dr. Polster carefully said, "From what I saw, it did not work in Hong Kong."</p>
            <p>Dr. Polster emphasized that democratic Taiwan is very encouraging. He is happy to see that people in Taiwan value democracy and the rule of law. This shows that these are not just Western values but values that all people should have.</p>
