            <h1>General Sentenced for Taking Washing Machine; Appeals Denied Twice</h1>
            <p>A former Major General, Lin Cheng-chia (whose original name was Lin Di-chih), who worked at the Kinmen Defense Command, was found guilty of taking a washing machine that belonged to the public. The washing machine was worth 7,990 NT dollars. He was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months in prison. His requests to have his case reviewed again were denied. The High Court denied his request for a new trial two times, and the Supreme Court also denied his last appeal today.</p>
            <p>The final court decision states that in December 2017, Lin found out that the Kinmen Defense Command's logistics department was going to buy washing machines for soldiers. He suggested buying one for the Deputy Chief of Staff. However, the Deputy Chief of Staff did not need a new washing machine. So, Lin sent the washing machine to his home in Taiwan and kept it for himself. Later, when Lin heard that people knew about it, he bought the same type of washing machine and sent it back to the army camp. He then sent the original washing machine back to Kinmen and put it in a friend's office, but his friend did not know what was happening.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen District Court in Fujian sentenced Lin to 12 years in prison for taking public property, which is a crime under the Anti-Corruption Act. The Kinmen Branch of the Fujian High Court later changed the sentence to 6 years and 8 months. Lin appealed again, but the Supreme Court rejected his appeal in January this year, and the sentence became final.</p>
            <p>Lin asked the Taiwan High Court for a new trial and to stop his prison sentence, saying he had new evidence. But his requests were denied. Lin was not happy and appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p>Lin showed documents like a proposal from the Kinmen Defense Command about how responsibilities were decided in 2018. He argued that the Kinmen Defense Command and the Army Logistics Command were not connected to each other. He also said that the Army Logistics Command's ammunition company bought the washing machine, and he did not have the power to decide or give out the items at that time. Therefore, he argued that he could not be guilty of using his job to take public property.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court decided that even if the Kinmen Defense Command and the Army Logistics Command were not connected, and the Army Logistics Command paid for the washing machines, these items were for public use. So, they were public property. This did not change the fact that he was guilty of taking public property. The court denied his appeal, and the decision is now final.</p>
            <p>Lin asked for a new trial again. He said that he had used the washing machine box to send a tea tray to his home in Tainan. He argued that the original court decision only used witness statements to guess that the package contained a washing machine, and this was wrong because the decision did not use clear evidence. The Kinmen High Court branch decided that Lin's request for a new trial did not meet the requirements for a new trial, and they denied it. The Supreme Court again denied his appeal today, making the decision final.</p>

            <h1>China Fights Corruption in Education: University Official Accused of Taking Research Funds</h1>
            <p>While China is saying that scientific research is very important, Wang Hanqing, who was the Party Secretary of Central South University of Forestry and Technology, was recently removed from his party and public positions. He is accused of serious corruption in academics, including taking a large amount of research money for himself. This happened shortly after Liao Xiaoping, the former president of the same university, was also investigated.</p>
            <p>According to reports, the Hunan Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision announced today that they have finished their investigation into serious violations of rules and laws by Wang Hanqing, the former Party Secretary of Central South University of Forestry and Technology.</p>
            <p>The announcement states that Wang Hanqing did many illegal things. These include being deeply involved in academic corruption, making a lot of money from private loans, doing business illegally, using his power to help his friends and family, taking huge amounts of money illegally, and using his job to take a lot of research funds for himself.</p>
            <p>The announcement also says that after discussions by the Hunan Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection Standing Committee and approval from the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, it was decided to remove Wang Hanqing from the Communist Party. The Hunan Provincial Supervisory Commission decided to remove him from his public job. All the money he got illegally will be taken away. His case, along with the money involved, will be sent to the prosecutor's office for legal action.</p>
            <p>Wang Hanqing used to be a vice president, president, and party secretary at several universities. In September 2019, he became the Party Secretary of Central South University of Forestry and Technology, and he left this position in 2023.</p>
            <p>On February 21 this year, it was officially announced that Wang Hanqing was being investigated. Six days before he was investigated, Liao Xiaoping, the former president of Central South University of Forestry and Technology, was also investigated.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Wang Hanqing was a leading talent in science and technology in Hunan Province and was a top talent in Hunan's 121 Talent Project. He was also the vice chairman of the Ministry of Education's Teaching Guidance Committee for Architectural Environment and Energy Application Engineering from 2018 to 2022. He has published over 230 papers in important academic journals in China and other countries, written 6 academic books, and edited or reviewed 5 textbooks for China's "Eleventh Five-Year Plan."</p>

            <h1>Southwest Winds Bring Heavy Rain Warnings to Kaohsiung and Pingtung Mountains</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration has issued a heavy rain warning. Southwest winds are causing strong, short bursts of rain. Today, mountain areas in Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County may have heavy rain or very heavy rain. There is also a chance of heavy rain in Penghu and areas south of Taichung.</p>
            <p>Also, the Weather Administration reminds people to watch out for lightning, strong winds, and rising river water. Low-lying areas should be careful of flooding. Because it has been raining for many days, mountain areas should be aware of loose soil, mudslides, landslides, falling rocks, and debris flows. People should avoid going to mountain areas.</p>
