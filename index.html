UK tourism is experiencing a surge in domestic travel as families opt for "staycations" to avoid expensive foreign holidays. The cost-of-living crisis, fuelled by rising inflation and energy prices, is forcing many to tighten their belts, leading to a shift in holiday preferences. Instead of flying abroad, people are exploring the beauty of the UK, from the Scottish Highlands to the Cornish coast.

This trend is providing a much-needed boost to the UK tourism industry, which suffered significant losses during the pandemic. Hotels, campsites, and local attractions are reporting increased bookings, especially during peak season. Businesses are adapting by offering more family-friendly packages and promoting sustainable travel options. The long-term impact remains to be seen, but for now, the staycation is proving to be a popular and affordable alternative for British holidaymakers.

**Tech Start-up Develops AI Tool to Predict Traffic Jams Before They Happen**

A tech start-up has created a new artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to accurately predict traffic jams before they actually occur. Using real-time data from traffic cameras, weather reports, and social media, the AI analyses patterns and anticipates potential congestion hotspots. The goal is to help drivers plan their routes more efficiently, reducing travel times and fuel consumption.

The system works by identifying early indicators of traffic build-up, such as unusual speed changes or increased traffic volume in certain areas. The AI then generates alerts and provides alternative route suggestions through a mobile app. Early trials have shown promising results, with the system predicting traffic jams with up to 85% accuracy. The company hopes to partner with local authorities and navigation apps to make the technology widely available to commuters.

**Cultural Exchange Program Bridges Gap Between Young Artists in Europe and Africa**

An innovative cultural exchange program is connecting young artists from Europe and Africa, fostering collaboration and understanding between different cultures. The program, funded by a European Union grant, offers artists the opportunity to live and work in each other's countries for several months. During their stay, they participate in workshops, exhibitions, and community projects.

The aim is to break down cultural barriers and promote dialogue through art. By working together, the artists are learning about each other's traditions, perspectives, and creative processes. The program also provides a platform for showcasing their work to a wider audience, increasing their visibility and career opportunities. Participants have described the experience as transformative, leading to new friendships, creative inspiration, and a deeper appreciation for the richness of global art.
