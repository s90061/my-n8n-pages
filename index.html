            <h1>Taiwan Team CFO Wins Championship, Heads to World Competition</h1>
            <p>In Vietnam, the Taiwanese team "CFO" (CTBC Flying Oyster) won the championship in the League of Legends LCP professional league finals. They beat the local team "Team Secret Whales" (TSW) 3-0. CFO will now go to the World Championship as the "King of the Pacific."</p>
            <p>CFO has not lost any games in the Pacific Professional League (LCP) for over six months. In the third part of the "Season Finals," they showed they were still the strongest. They stayed undefeated and made it to the finals. Now, they have won against TSW from Vietnam with a score of 3-0. The team happily held up the championship trophy. They will go to the World Championship as the number one team from the LCP league to compete with other strong teams.</p>
            <p>After the game, HongQ (Cai Ming-hong), a new "monster" player in the middle lane, was named the most valuable player (FMVP) of the final match. He told reporters he was very happy to win the championship. He praised his teammates for playing very well and winning the game easily. Even though they hadn't played for a while and weren't completely used to the venue, everyone adjusted quickly. He said he found an opening on the side in the third game, which worked very well and helped them win.</p>
            <p>CFO's coach, Chawy (Huang Hsin-lei), said that winning all three parts of the LCP league this season was more than he expected. The main reason was HongQ's big improvement in a short time. He gave the players a score of over 100 points. He said, "Everyone played very well, and the team spirit was good. When there were mistakes, we encouraged each other instead of blaming. This helped everyone improve very quickly."</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to the World Championship, HongQ said he is very excited but also a little nervous. He hopes everyone will keep up their current good performance and not relax before the World Championship. He wants them to try their best in every game. Coach Chawy shared that he is not a coach who sets big goals. He just hopes his players play well in every game and enjoy the process of playing.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Kajasah's Strong Winds Reach 58 Meters Per Second, Storm Area May Grow</h1>
            <p>The weather office said that Typhoon Kajasah is in a good place to grow stronger. In the past three hours, it has gotten stronger again. Its strongest winds near the center are now 58 meters per second. The typhoon might get even stronger in the next 6 to 12 hours, and its storm area might also get bigger. However, the weather office still expects the typhoon's effects on Taiwan to be the same as first thought.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Administration, at 11 PM tonight, Typhoon Kajasah's center was at 19.0 degrees North latitude and 124.8 degrees East longitude. This is about 520 kilometers southeast of Eluanbi. It is moving west at 21 kilometers per hour. The strongest winds near its center are 58 meters per second (about 209 kilometers per hour), which is like Level 17 winds. The strongest sudden gusts are 73 meters per second (about 263 kilometers per hour), which is stronger than Level 17 winds.</p>
            <p>The weather office said that Kajasah has gotten a little stronger in the last three hours. Its center is now southeast of Eluanbi, moving west. It will be a danger to Taitung, Pingtung, and the Hengchun Peninsula. The typhoon is expected to get a little stronger, and its storm area is expected to get a little bigger.</p>
            <p>Weather forecaster Lin Bo-dong said that Kajasah is currently in conditions that help it grow. Also, its center structure has changed a little. Because of this, Kajasah's strongest winds near its center have reached 58 meters per second. It is expected to keep moving west towards the Bashi Channel. It will get stronger in the next 6 to 12 hours, and its storm area will get bigger. However, the weather office's idea of how it will affect Taiwan is still the same as before.</p>
            <p>Lin Bo-dong said about the wind, that for the next 36 hours, strong winds will not be clear in most parts of Taiwan. They will be mainly in the south. In the next 18 hours, the area with strong winds will get bigger and stronger. The Hengchun Peninsula will have very strong winds (Level 12 to 13) tomorrow morning and afternoon. Orchid Island and Green Island will also have very strong winds (Level 12-13) tomorrow during the day. Taitung will have strong winds (Level 10) tomorrow afternoon.</p>
            <p>The weather office also continues to give strong wind warnings. From tonight until tomorrow night, Orchid Island, Green Island, and some parts of Pingtung County have a chance of having average winds stronger than Level 9 or wind gusts stronger than Level 11 (orange warning). Some parts of Keelung City, Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, Miaoli County, Taichung City, Nantou County, Changhua County, Yunlin County, Chiayi County, Kaohsiung City, Yilan County, Hualien County, Taitung County, Penghu County, Kinmen County, and Lienchiang County have a chance of having average winds stronger than Level 6 or wind gusts stronger than Level 8.</p>
            <p>Regarding rain, Lin Bo-dong said that rain forecasts show that Yilan, Hualien, and the North Coast will have heavy rain or very heavy rain tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, the rain in Keelung's North Coast, eastern Taiwan, and the Hengchun Peninsula will become more noticeable. Tomorrow afternoon, the rain will get stronger. Yilan, Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have heavy rain or very heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Lin Bo-dong pointed out that tomorrow night, Kajasah will slowly pass south of the Bashi Channel. After the wind changes direction, the rain in Yilan will get lighter. However, it will keep raining in Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula. The rain might even spread to the mountains of Kaohsiung and Pingtung. On the 23rd, Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have very heavy rain for the whole day.</p>
            <p>Lin Bo-dong also said that even though there won't be much rain in western Taiwan, the outer winds of Kajasah will cause high temperatures in the central areas. Especially in Miaoli, Taichung, Changhua, and Yunlin, temperatures could reach 36 degrees Celsius, or even higher than 37 degrees Celsius.</p>
