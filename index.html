            <h1>Taipei Police and Public Work Together to Catch Missing Migrant Workers; Two Men Arrested</h1>
            <p>Taipei police recently stopped a suspicious car in Wanhua District. Three men in the back of the car suddenly ran away. Police officers chased them in different directions. Two helpful scooter riders, Mr. Chen and Mr. Hsu, saw this and helped the police. However, they had an accident and got hurt. In the end, police caught two Vietnamese men who had stayed in Taiwan longer than allowed. One person is still missing, and police are looking for him.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Police Department's Security Police Brigade said in a press release today that officers from the second team were on patrol on Heping West Road in Wanhua District at 10 AM on August 7th. They saw a suspicious car and stopped it to check. But the three men in the back seat suddenly ran away when they saw the police.</p>
            <p>The police first controlled the two Vietnamese women in the front seat. Then, they started a strong chase. During the chase, scooter riders Mr. Chen and Mr. Hsu bravely joined in. They actively gave rides to the police officers to help with the chase.</p>
            <p>However, as they chased into an alley, Mr. Chen and Mr. Hsu's scooters accidentally crashed. Mr. Hsu fell and was injured. The team leader, Wu Wen-cheng, who was with them, also fell. But even with his injury, he managed to catch one man. This man was a missing Vietnamese migrant worker.</p>
            <p>Later investigations showed that the police stopped five Vietnamese people that day. Two women had legal documents. The two Vietnamese men, both in their 30s, who were caught had overstayed their visas for more than 500 days and 60 days, respectively. After questioning, they were sent to the National Immigration Agency. One Vietnamese man is still at large, and the police are actively looking for him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsu, the kind person who was injured, was taken to the hospital and is not in danger.</p>
            <p>The Security Police Brigade said that the police specially thank the brave citizens for helping catch the illegal migrant workers. This shows the strong cooperation between the police and the public and the good values of society. The police have sent officers to visit the injured person and will praise their good deed.</p>

            <h1>AUO Continues Mergers and Acquisitions, Tries to Avoid the Panel Industry's Ups and Downs</h1>
            <p>AU Optronics (AUO), a company that makes display panels, has bought BHTC, a main supplier for German carmakers. At home, AUO has also been very active. It now controls Fucai, a large LED company. Also, in June this year, AUO changed the board members at Adlink Technology's shareholder meeting and now fully controls its board. AUO recently announced in a meeting for investors that Adlink's money and debts will be part of AUO's financial reports starting from the second quarter. These big new investments have caught the market's attention.</p>
            <p>In the past, when panel makers were expanding their production a lot, Kuen-Yao Lee, who started the BenQ-AUO Group, led the purchase of panel maker Quanta Display. However, buying the mobile phone part of a big German company, Siemens, ended in failure.</p>
            <p>After Kuen-Yao Lee retired, he handed over the BenQ Qisda Group, which makes LCDs and manages brands, to its current chairman, Antonio Chen. The panel company AU Optronics was given to its current chairman, Paul Peng.</p>
            <p>After Antonio Chen took over Qisda, he bought many small "hidden champion" companies, both listed and unlisted. Antonio Chen was the 4th chairman of the Taiwan Mergers & Acquisitions and Private Equity Council. He called the large group of companies under Qisda, which includes networking, healthcare, smart solutions, and low-orbit satellites, the "Qisda Grand Fleet."</p>
            <p>However, AUO, a panel maker, used to invest mostly in companies related to panels. This made it hard for them to escape the panel industry's cycle, where they might "earn for 1 year but lose for 2 years."</p>
            <p>The panel industry works best for the biggest companies. Terry Gou, who started Foxconn, once helped Innolux Corporation, a smaller company, buy Chi Mei Optoelectronics, a much bigger company. At the same time, Innolux also bought TPO Displays from the Compal Group. Its production capacity was once bigger than South Korea's LG Display, making it the second-largest panel maker in the world. But then, Chinese panel makers kept building more factories, and China became the world's biggest supplier of panels.</p>
            <p>Because there are too many LCD panels, Korean companies have been selling their factories and focusing on OLED panels. Taiwanese companies AUO and Innolux are changing their old production lines and investing in new technologies and products. AUO is developing a new panel technology called MicroLED. Innolux is moving into semiconductor packaging, making FOPLP (Fan-Out Panel Level Packaging). At the same time, both AUO and Innolux have sold factories to semiconductor companies to get cash.</p>
            <p>However, to escape the panel industry's cycle, AUO has created three main areas: Display, Mobility Solution, and Vertical Solution. To grow its smart mobility business, it bought BHTC, a key supplier of car parts in Germany. To push MicroLED technology, it took control of Fucai. This time, for Vertical Solution, it is investing in Adlink Technology to develop AI edge computing.</p>
            <p>AUO said in a recent meeting for investors that the combined sales from its smart mobility and vertical solution businesses made up 43% of its total sales in the second quarter. They hope this will be more than 50% by 2027. The market is watching closely to see if AUO's new investments can make these three main areas strong and truly help the company escape the ups and downs of the panel industry.</p>
