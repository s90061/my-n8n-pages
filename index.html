            <h1>Culture Expo Indigenous Night: Paiwan Songs and Dances Meet New Zealand Dance Group</h1>
            <p>"We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka - Kansai Expo" is now happening in Osaka, Japan. It shows Taiwanese culture to the world. The Indigenous Peoples Council is helping. Tonight, a Paiwan performance group and a New Zealand dance group shared their culture through singing and dancing. They also greeted each other with the Maori nose touch.</p>
            <p>This is the second weekend of the Culture Expo. The "Night of Indigenous Peoples" event is a cooperation between the Indigenous Peoples Council and the Ministry of Culture. The Indigenous Peoples Council is working with the "Indigenous Peoples Economic and Trade Cooperation Agreement" (IPETCA) for performances and events on the main stage of the Osaka Expo. Taiwan is one of the first members of IPETCA. Tonight, special guests came from New Zealand, Canada, and Australia, who are also members.</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sih, the Deputy Minister of Culture, said she was happy about the cooperation between the Indigenous Peoples Council and IPETCA. She also said the Ministry of Culture has been officially invited by the Expo to perform for three days, from August 26 to 28, inside the Expo park. Nine groups will perform in five parts. They will show how Taiwanese people are thankful to nature and gods, and how much they love life.</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sih also said that indigenous culture is a very important part of this. The Ministry of Culture has invited Sangpuy, an indigenous singer from Taitung's Puyuma group, and the Hope Children's Choir from Pingtung's Paiwan group. They will sing "Blessings from Ancient Times: Dedicated to Heaven and Earth." This will let the world hear the beautiful voices of Taiwan's indigenous people. In the "Magical Taiwan" exhibition, which has Taiwanese literature and picture books, readers can learn about the old and wise spiritual world of Taiwan's indigenous people.</p>
            <p>Chiu Huang Chao-chung, the Director of the Indigenous Cultural Development Center, said that Taiwan's indigenous people have a long history and rich culture. They are also closely connected to the Austronesian people, who have about 400 million people worldwide. Experts believe Taiwan is where the Austronesian people first came from. He said, "Culture does not need translation. It can cross languages and countries and connect people."</p>
            <p>The Kahurangi MƒÅori Dance Theatre from New Zealand also took part. This dance group works to show Maori performing arts in modern ways. For example, tonight, 15 dancers gave an amazing show that mixed Maori songs, RAP, and dance.</p>
            <p>The Nalowan Dance Troupe sang a special Paiwan song. Paiwan people sing this song when they gather happily. It celebrated everyone coming together in Osaka, Japan. They also sang the song "Uniyu" to ask for good luck from above. In addition, they performed a traditional dance called "Harmony," which included a "Ladies' Dance." They also did a traditional warrior dance that copied how clouded leopards and black bears jump and run in the forest. This allowed the audience to feel the unique beauty and life energy of the Paiwan people.</p>
            <p>The "We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka - Kansai Expo" event is happening from now until August 20. It is online, at SPACE VS. (at GRAND GREEN OSAKA) in Osaka, and at Osaka Central Public Hall and Nakanoshima.</p>

            <h1>Germany Sets Up First National Security Council to Improve Security Response</h1>
            <p>The German government announced today that it will create its first National Security Council (NSR) at the end of August. This council will work directly under Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Its goal is to combine security resources from different government departments. This will help Germany react better to security problems and plan its strategies.</p>
            <p>The war in Ukraine is almost four years old, and the security situation in Europe is still tense. The Chancellor's office said that Mr. Merz sees the NSR as an important step. It will help to make former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's idea of a "turning point" (Zeitenwende) a regular part of how the government works.</p>
            <p>The idea for a National Security Council has been talked about in Germany for many decades. But it was never put into action. The main reason was a rule in the German constitution called the "ministerial principle." This rule says that each minister has a lot of power in their own area of work. This made it hard for the Chancellor to directly get involved in what departments were doing.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Federal Foreign Office was also worried that if the NSR was created directly under the Chancellor's office, it would make the Foreign Office less powerful. So, they did not support the idea.</p>
            <p>In May of this year, a new government led by the CDU party came to power. For the first time in many years, the Chancellor's office and the Foreign Ministry are led by people from the same party. This helped to solve the long-standing argument about who has power, and so the plan to create the NSR can now happen.</p>
            <p>The first meeting of the National Security Council will be on August 27. It will take place at the Ministry of Defense building. This new group will take the place of the current Federal Security Council, which handles weapon sales. It will also replace the special security cabinet meetings that happened when there was a big national security crisis.</p>
            <p>The members of the National Security Council will include the Chancellor, the head of the Chancellor's office, and the ministers from the Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, Interior Ministry, Finance Ministry, Economy Ministry, Justice Ministry, Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Digital Ministry. If needed, officials from German states, representatives from international security groups like NATO or the European Union, and outside experts can also be invited to meetings.</p>
            <p>The NSR office will be inside the Chancellor's office. It will be led by Jacob Schrot, who is Mr. Merz's chief of staff. The office will have 13 staff members. They will help different departments work together and get ready for meetings.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor's office explained that the main aim of the NSR is to stop "information silos." This means bringing together all the knowledge and information that different government departments and spy agencies have. This will make sure that decisions about national security are based on full and up-to-date information.</p>
            <p>Second, the National Security Council will find possible security threats that might happen in the middle or long term. They will plan how to deal with these threats. They will also update the "National Security Strategy" that the previous government made.</p>
            <p>Another important job of the National Security Council is to make Germany's security system more professional. This includes building secure communication systems to stop people from listening in. It also means regularly practicing how to deal with big national security problems. For example, they will plan how all departments and related groups should work together quickly if a German passenger plane is hijacked.</p>
