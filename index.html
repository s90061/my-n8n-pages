Taiwan's central bank has issued a warning that the United States' quickly increasing national debt might negatively affect confidence in U.S. Treasury bonds. The central bank governor stated that while the U.S. dollar and Treasuries remain important globally, the continuous growth of debt could present risks. Taiwan, a significant holder of U.S. debt, is closely observing these developments, highlighting concerns about the long-term sustainability of the debt and its potential impact on international financial markets.

**Taiwan Railway Fares to Increase, New Refund Policy for Delays**

Starting tomorrow, June 23rd, Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares will see their first increase in 30 years, with an average rise of 26.8%. Along with passenger tickets, fees for luggage, parcels, and Taiwan PASS rail products will also go up. Additionally, the free travel distance for electronic payment cards like EasyCard and iPASS will be reduced from 70 kilometers to 50 kilometers. However, there's good news for passengers experiencing delays: if a train is more than 10 minutes late, travelers can now get a full refund without any service fees.

**Taiwan Adds Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List, Affecting China's AI Chip Goals**

Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has officially included Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on its export control list. This decision is expected to be a major obstacle to China's development of artificial intelligence chips. The move aligns Taiwan more closely with Washington's efforts to restrict companies that are advancing Beijingâ€™s AI capabilities. Experts suggest that while not a direct response to a single event, the discovery of TSMC-made chips in Huawei products last year prompted Taiwan to review its oversight mechanisms to prevent indirect supply chain loopholes. This action highlights increasing trade and technology tensions between Taiwan, China, and the United States.
