Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner won his first Wimbledon title by beating Spain's Carlos Alcaraz. This win was important because Sinner had lost to Alcaraz in the French Open final just last month. Sinner is the first Italian man to win Wimbledon. He now has four major tennis titles, and Alcaraz has five. Their match was very exciting. Sinner stayed calm and won three sets to one after losing the first set. After the game, Sinner said he was "living in his dream."

**Former Nigerian President Buhari dies at 82**

Muhammadu Buhari, who used to be the president of Nigeria, has died in London. He was 82 years old. Buhari was a strong military leader in the 1980s. Later, he became a democratically elected president, serving two terms from 2015 to 2023. He made history in 2015 by being the first person to win an election against a president who was already in office. However, during his time as president, he could not fix the country's long-standing problems with corruption and security. Also, Nigeria's economy became worse under his rule.

They can be used to protect against low-flying threats and can also be used as direct weapons if needed. Taiwan uses four different types of Stinger missiles.
