            <h1>Experts: If Ukraine Loses Donbas Defense, It Could Be Like Czechoslovakia Losing Sudetenland in 1938</h1>
            <p>It is said that Russia wants Ukraine to give up Donbas as a way to end the war. A Czech expert has said that if Ukraine loses its main defense in Donbas, Russia will be able to invade Ukraine's land easily. This would be like when Czechoslovakia lost its Sudetenland region in 1938 and was later taken over by the Nazis.</p>
            <p>After a meeting between the leaders of the US and Russia, it was said that Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Ukraine give up Donbas to end the war.</p>
            <p>Zdeňka Petráš, an expert from Brno Defense University, spoke to the Czech News Agency today. She said, "Besides the money side, even though Donbas is an industrial area with coal and oil, for Ukraine, it's even more important because the area forms a very important defense line."</p>
            <p>This defense line is made of strong defenses built by Ukraine in important parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. These defenses were built little by little after fighting started in 2014 between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian groups. They were made much stronger after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 to stop Russian troops from moving west.</p>
            <p>This defense line includes Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in the north, the area around Lyman in the middle, and near Pokrovsk in the south.</p>
            <p>Petráš said that this defense line is very important for Ukraine's protection. "If Ukraine loses this defense line, its land will become completely open to another Russian invasion, and they won't be able to build new defense points."</p>
            <p>Petráš compared this situation to Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement in 1938. At that time, because Czechoslovakia lost its defenses in the Sudetenland border area, Nazi Germany could easily take over the whole country.</p>
            <p>In current international talks, one topic is how to keep Ukraine safe. Petráš said these safety plans are still not clear, only described as "strong." But in real life, Russia has the upper hand in the fighting. So, if they talk about safety plans, they must be something Russia can also agree to and accept.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and representatives from Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Finland, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, met at the White House on August 18. They talked about how to end the war, which has lasted for more than three years. After the meeting, they decided to arrange a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin.</p>

            <h1>China Claims Indian Foreign Minister Said Taiwan Belongs to China; India Denies Misquotation</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in its meeting notes that India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar said "Taiwan is part of China" when he met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi yesterday. However, Indian news today reported that government sources denied China had incorrectly quoted Jaishankar. India's official position on Taiwan has not changed.</p>
            <p>The "Hindustan Times" reported that after Jaishankar met with Wang Yi in New Delhi yesterday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs published the notes from their talk. This statement was only shared in Chinese.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry's notes reportedly included a long section of what Jaishankar supposedly said, and one sentence was "Taiwan is part of China." However, China did not release any English version of the meeting notes.</p>
            <p>According to reports, a government source, who did not want to be named, said: "Our position on Taiwan has not changed. We want to make it clear that, like other countries in the world, India's relationship with Taiwan is focused on trade, technology, and cultural sharing. We plan to keep this relationship going."</p>
            <p>A second source said that when Wang Yi met yesterday, he asked India not to have dealings with Taiwan. Jaishankar responded by questioning this, saying that since China itself has exchanges with Taiwan in the same areas, just like India, how could India not have dealings with Taiwan?</p>
            <p>This person said that the Chinese Foreign Ministry's notes incorrectly quoted Jaishankar's words. Chinese official news widely reported these statements, which were supposedly from Jaishankar.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Putin May Not Want a Deal; Rules Out Sending US Troops to Defend Ukraine</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today that he hopes Russian President Putin will work to end the war in Ukraine. But he also said that Putin might not want to make a deal at all. Trump also repeated that the US will not send soldiers to fight in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Trump met with Putin face-to-face in Alaska, USA, on August 15. Then, yesterday, he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump hopes to help Russia and Ukraine stop fighting.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump was interviewed by the Fox News TV show "Fox & Friends" today. He said he expects Putin's plans to become clear in the next few weeks.</p>
            <p>Trump again said the US will not send soldiers to Ukraine. He did not give clear details about the "safety promises" he had mentioned before. He had said that Washington might offer Kyiv safety promises in any agreement after the war.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Honestly, I think (reaching a peace deal) will not be a problem. I think Putin is tired, I think they are all tired, but no one knows for sure."</p>
            <p>Trump added, "We will learn about President Putin's situation in the next few weeks... It is possible he does not want a deal."</p>
            <p>Trump had previously warned that if Putin did not agree to a peace deal, he would put more restrictions on Russia and countries that buy Russian oil.</p>
