            <h1>Ko Wen-je's Political Donation Case: Taipei Court Calls Zhou Yuxiu, Li Wanxuan to Testify</h1>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is hearing cases about the Jinghua City project and Ko Wen-je's political donations. Today, the court called former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, former campaign finance manager Li Wenzong, and Wood Company chairwoman Li Wenjuan to appear. It also called Taiwan People's Party Secretary-General Zhou Yuxiu and Wood Public Relations employee Li Wanxuan to give their testimony as witnesses.</p>
            <p>Last year, the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office finished its investigation into the Jinghua City case and Ko Wen-je's political donation case. They accused former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, former Department of Urban Development Director Huang Jingmao, Weiching Group Chairman Shen Qingjing, and Taipei City Councilor Ying Xiaowei, along with 7 others, of crimes like taking bribes, helping others illegally, stealing public money, and acting against trust. The prosecutors asked for a total of 28 and a half years in prison for Ko Wen-je.</p>
            <p>Besides the Jinghua City case, Ko Wen-je is also accused of illegally taking NT$6 million in political donations and using Wood Company to take more than NT$62.34 million. He is also accused of using over NT$8.27 million from the Zhongwang Foundation. Today, the Taipei District Court called Ko Wen-je, Li Wenzong, and Li Wenjuan as defendants. Zhou Yuxiu and Li Wanxuan were called as witnesses. Both the prosecution and defense lawyers asked them questions.</p>
            <p>Also, Ko Wen-je and Ying Xiaowei recently asked to be released on bail. The Taipei District Court allowed them to be released on bail, with Ko paying NT$70 million and Ying paying NT$30 million. However, the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office believes that not all witnesses have been questioned yet. They also said that after Ko Wen-je was released on bail, he talked to witnesses Chen Zhihan and Chen Youcheng. This goes against the court's rule that he "must not contact any witnesses." So, on September 9th, the prosecutors appealed the bail decision.</p>
            <p>After receiving the appeal from the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office, the Taipei District Court organized the recent court records and copied important documents. They plan to send the appeal documents to the Taiwan High Court this morning.</p>

            <h1>Young American Conservative Leader Dies: Charlie Kirk, Campus Debater and Trump's Friend</h1>
            <p>Charlie Kirk, a well-known American conservative person, died today in Utah. He was giving a speech at a university when he was shot. He was 31 years old. Kirk was an important friend of former President Donald Trump. He was also one of the most famous online personalities and a leader of young conservative groups.</p>
            <p>News from BBC and AFP says that Kirk was shot and died while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. He was known for holding public debates at universities all over the United States, actively sharing conservative ideas.</p>
            <p>He had millions of followers on social media. People liked him because he made smart video edits and responded strongly to people who disagreed with him or challenged his ideas.</p>
            <p>Kirk's father was an architect. He grew up in a rich area near Chicago. After high school, he went to a community college but later left to work full-time in politics. He also tried to get into the famous U.S. Military Academy (West Point) but was not accepted.</p>
            <p>In 2012, when he was only 18, Kirk helped start a student group called "Turning Point USA" (TPUSA). This group worked to share conservative ideas on American university campuses, which often supported liberal ideas.</p>
            <p>In just over 10 years, this group became the largest young conservative group in the U.S.</p>
            <p>He often shared videos on social media and his daily podcast (online radio show) where he debated university students about topics like transgender people, climate change, faith, and family values.</p>
            <p>When he talked about difficult topics like postmodernism with students and teachers on campuses, Kirk often joked that he did not have a university degree.</p>
            <p>After former President Barack Obama won re-election in 2012, Kirk's role in "Turning Point USA" became much more important.</p>
            <p>In last year's American election, "Turning Point USA" played a very important part in getting people to vote for Trump and other Republican candidates. Many people believed that Kirk helped tens of thousands of people register to vote, which helped change the election results in Arizona.</p>
            <p>Kirk gained Trump's support. He went to Trump's inauguration in Washington D.C. in January this year and was often at the White House during Trump's two terms as president.</p>
            <p>Trump and his White House staff really valued Kirk's good understanding of the "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) movement among ordinary people. Kirk gave speeches at Republican events many times. Last year, Trump also went to the "Turning Point USA" meeting in Arizona to speak.</p>
            <p>Kirk was an evangelical Christian. His religion and family were central to his political beliefs. He was married to a former Miss Arizona and had two children. He was seen as a rising star in the conservative movement, but people had very different opinions about him.</p>
            <p>Kirk discussed many political and social topics in his events and podcasts, including the right to own guns.</p>
            <p>A few months ago, he said, "Sadly, if we have to pay the price of some shooting deaths every year to protect the Second Amendment, then it is worth it." The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people the right to own and carry weapons.</p>
            <p>However, some of his statements caused arguments. According to CBS news, Kirk supported anti-transgender ideas, questioned the COVID-19 pandemic, and openly said that the "2020 election was stolen."</p>
            <p>Also, Kirk promoted the "Great Replacement" conspiracy theory. This theory suggests that Jewish people and left-wing groups are planning to replace white people with non-white immigrants, which would lead to the "genocide of white people."</p>
            <p>Last year, when a reporter from AFP asked Kirk about whether his statements were true, he just laughed. He said, "We are just spreading the truth."</p>

            <h1>US Congress Remembers US-Taiwan Friendship in WWII, Rejects China's View on 80th Anniversary</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office in the U.S. and an American veterans' center held an event together in the U.S. Capitol building. It was to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Allied victory in World War II. Family members of the "Flying Tigers" (American pilots who helped China during the war) received awards. This event reminded everyone about the history of the U.S. and Taiwan fighting together. A member of the U.S. Congress proposed a bill that rejects China's idea of "winning the war." Taiwan's representative to the U.S., Yu Tai-sheng, clearly said that changing history shows no respect for those who died in the war.</p>
            <p>Some U.S. Congress members have personal connections to military help between the U.S. and Taiwan. For example, Congressman Joe Wilson's father was a "Flying Tiger." Senator Dan Sullivan, who was in the military, was sent to the Taiwan Strait in 1995 and 1996 with the Marines and a group of warships. This happened when China was causing trouble before Taiwan's presidential election.</p>
            <p>Congressman Wilson came to the event in the Capitol today. He received an award for his father, who has passed away. He said he was sad that China tries to erase the U.S.'s role in helping to free China during World War II. Wilson, who strongly supports Taiwan and carries business cards written in traditional Chinese, said that if Taiwan is stronger, it is less likely that there will be a fight. He said this is what they hope for the people of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's representative Yu Tai-sheng also mentioned that on September 3, China held a military parade in Tiananmen Square. This parade was to celebrate the "80th Anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War Victory." He said the parade itself looked like fascism, and Tiananmen Square is also where the Tiananmen Square Massacre happened. This made the parade seem strange and wrong.</p>
            <p>He became very sad when he talked about the people who died in the war. He almost cried. He said that China's attempt to change what people know about history, and to forget the real heroes of the war, is unfair to them. It is also disrespectful to those who died and to history itself.</p>
            <p>He stated, "China tries to say that they won World War II (the Pacific War). But I want to remind everyone that we (Taiwan and the U.S.) were the ones fighting side by side on the battlefield. They (the Chinese People's Liberation Army) were the ones fighting against the U.S. military in the Korean War. This is the truth."</p>
            <p>Republican U.S. Congressman Chris Smith also introduced a bill that afternoon. It goes against China's "stolen valor" (meaning claiming military honors they did not earn). The bill also honors the Republic of China's contributions to the Allied victory and acknowledges Japan's government for helping to create peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific area after the war.</p>
            <p>The bill explains that the Chinese Communist Party and its soldiers fought very little against the Japanese Empire. The Republic of China's soldiers did most of the fighting and suffered most of the losses. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party got stronger with help from the Soviet Union. This helped them prepare for a civil war against the Republic of China government later, which eventually led to the Communist Party controlling China.</p>
            <p>Joint resolutions show the U.S. Congress's position or ideas on certain topics. The president does not need to sign them, so they do not have legal power.</p>
            <p>Today, besides Congressman Wilson, the children of other "Flying Tigers" who have passed awayâ€”Li Xueyan, Qiao Wuwu, and Chen Hongquanâ€”also came to receive awards. Dave Yoho, who was sent to fight in the Pacific when he was less than 16 years old in the summer of 1944, also came to the event.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yoho is now 97 years old. He is still healthy and speaks very clearly. He hopes young people will remember history. He said, "We gave up our yesterday so that others could have their tomorrow."</p>
            <p>The people remembered today were not only from World War II. In 1954, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Medendorp from the U.S. military advisory group was in Kinmen. During that time, the "September 3rd Artillery Battle" (the first Taiwan Strait Crisis) happened. China fired more than 30,000 artillery shells. Lieutenant Colonel Medendorp and Lieutenant Colonel Frank Lynn sadly died in Shuitou.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Colonel Medendorp was 47 years old when he died. He was originally part of the Michigan National Guard. Today, Ravindra Wagh, the commander of the Michigan National Guard Army, received the award for him.</p>
