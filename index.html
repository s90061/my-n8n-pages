Typhoon Danas brought heavy rain to Taichung early today. In Qingshui District, a house on Jingpu Road got flooded. A woman living there was helped to leave her home and was taken to a safe place. Later, when the water went down, she went back to check her house. The water department and other groups will work to fix the cause of the flooding.

Due to Typhoon Danas, Taichung had strong winds and rain this morning. Areas like Shalu and Qingshui were badly flooded, and many people's furniture was wet. The fire department was told about the flooded house in Qingshui. The woman was moved out and stayed at a hotel in Qingshui for a short time.

The Civil Affairs Bureau said that at 10:30 AM, staff from the Qingshui District office visited the woman. The rain was getting lighter, and the water was slowly disappearing. The woman went with the staff to her home. Her house was messy with mud because of the flood.

The Qingshui District Office looked at the area around the woman's house and tried to understand why it flooded. They believe the water came from an irrigation ditch nearby that overflowed when it rained a lot. This caused a lot of water to enter the house. The water department and other relevant groups will fix this problem and offer help if needed.

**Allianz Applies to Offer New ETFs in Taiwan**

The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) announced today that Allianz Global Investors, which is part of the Allianz Group, wants to offer its first active ETF in Taiwan. They asked to do this on July 4th. Allianz is the first foreign investment company to join Taiwan's market for ETFs, following a plan to make Taiwan an important financial center in Asia.

The TWSE said that Allianz Global Investors is a big foreign company known for managing money well. Their plan is to offer the "Allianz Taiwan High Dividend Growth Active ETF" (00984A) in Taiwan. They officially asked the TWSE on July 4th to list this new ETF.

Allianz Global Investors shared that launching this ETF in Taiwan is a very important decision for the Allianz Group, as it is their first active ETF in the world. They chose Taiwan because they believe Taiwan's money market is strong and active. They also see that people in Taiwan have different needs for how they want to invest their money.

To help Taiwan become a main center for managing money in Asia, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) started a plan in September 2024. This plan has five main goals and 16 ways to achieve them. One important part of this plan is to invite more foreign companies that manage money to invest in Taiwan and to encourage those already here to invest even more.

The TWSE also said that since the FSC allowed companies to offer active ETFs this year, several have already been listed. The first was Nomura Taiwan Smart Select Active ETF (00980A) on May 5th. After that, three more were listed: Cathay Taiwan Select Strong Active ETF (00982A), Uni-President Taiwan Stock Growth Active ETF (00981A), and CTBC ARK Innovation Active ETF (00983A). Now, there are four active ETFs available, which shows good progress for Taiwan's plan to be an Asia Asset Management Center.

**Typhoon Danas Fills Taiwan's Reservoirs with 170 Million Tons of Water**

Typhoon Danas brought a lot of rain to Taiwan. The Water Resources Agency says that in the last three days, Taiwan's reservoirs gained an estimated 177.27 million tons of water. Reservoirs in the south got the most water, with Zengwen and Wusanto reservoirs together getting 70 million tons, which is the highest amount.

According to the Water Resources Agency, from 7 AM on July 5th until 4 PM today, the total rainfall that went into reservoirs in the north, center, south, and on islands is about 177.27 million tons. About 102.81 million tons are already in the reservoirs, and the rest will arrive in the next few days.

Southern reservoirs received the most water from the rain, getting over 100 million tons. Their water levels are now about 90% full. Zengwen and Wusanto reservoirs got the most, with 70 million tons combined. Mudan Reservoir was next, receiving 26.3 million tons, which made its water level go up by almost 20%. Nanhua Reservoir got 17.6 million tons, making it the third highest.

Reservoirs in central Taiwan received more than 50 million tons of water in total. Wushe and Sun Moon Lake reservoirs, which are connected, gained the most at 18 million tons. Other reservoirs that received over 10 million tons include Hushan Reservoir (14 million tons) and Liyutan Reservoir (12 million tons). Northern Taiwan's reservoirs got about 5 million tons in total, with Feicui Reservoir getting the most at 2.3 million tons.

Because of the recent typhoon rains, the water levels in Taiwan's reservoirs have risen. Some reservoirs have started to release water to manage the levels. The Water Resources Agency website shows that reservoirs like Baoshan Second, Dapu, Mingde, Liyutan, and others are currently releasing water.

The Water Resources Agency wants to remind people that if a reservoir warns about releasing water, anyone downstream should quickly leave the river area to avoid danger.
