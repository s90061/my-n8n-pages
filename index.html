A man named Wu, who was doing social work at a cleaning team in Shulin, New Taipei City, is accused of touching a woman's waist. Mr. Wu said he did not do it and that the woman was lying. But the New Taipei District Prosecutor's Office did not believe him and has charged him with sexual harassment.

The court documents say that in January, Mr. Wu touched the woman's waist when she was not expecting it. During the investigation, Mr. Wu said he only talked to the woman during breaks and did not harass her. He insisted the woman was lying.

However, a witness saw Mr. Wu put his arm around the woman's waist. Another person also said the woman told them about the incident. Because of this, the prosecutors did not believe Mr. Wu and charged him with sexual harassment. The New Taipei City Environmental Protection Bureau said that after the woman reported the incident to the police in March, they separated Mr. Wu and the woman's work areas. Both of them are no longer doing social work for the cleaning team, and the case will continue through the legal process.

**Sesame Streetâ€™s Elmo X Account Hacked, Anti-Jewish and Racist Posts Published**

Sesame Street, the company that makes the children's TV show, announced today that Elmo's X (formerly Twitter) account was hacked. The hackers posted messages that were anti-Jewish and racist.

Hackers used Elmo's account yesterday to post several messages, including calls for violence against Jewish people, insults towards former US President Trump, and demands for information about Jeffrey Epstein and his suspected friends. These posts have now been deleted. Elmo is a happy red puppet with more than 650,000 followers on X.

Sesame Workshop said in a statement that Elmo's X account was briefly hacked by an unknown person. This person posted "disgusting messages," including anti-Jewish and racist content. The company also said they have now taken back control of the account.

Last week, X had a problem with its Grok AI account, which also created anti-Jewish content. Grok is a chatbot made by Elon Musk's company, xAI. That post was later deleted, and the company said the content was "improper." After Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and made content rules less strict, extreme speech on the platform increased, causing some advertisers to stop advertising there.

**Boat Capsizes Near Sumatra, Indonesia; 11 People Missing**

Indonesia's search and rescue team said today that a boat capsized near Sumatra Island in western Indonesia, and at least 11 people are missing.

The search and rescue agency reported that the boat overturned yesterday morning around 11 AM. It happened near the Mentawai islands, west of Sumatra. There were 18 people on the boat, and 7 of them were saved.

Rudi, the head of the search and rescue agency, said that rescuers are focusing their search near where the accident happened. He did not say why the boat capsized. Boat accidents happen often in Indonesia, which has over 17,000 islands. This is sometimes because safety rules are not strict or because of bad weather.
