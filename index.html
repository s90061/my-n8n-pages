            <h1>Yilan Pig Supply is Low; Ministry of Agriculture Wants More Pigs from Taiwan Sugar, Hopes for Stability by October.</h1>
            <p>Yilan's supply of live pigs is low. This means that pig meat stalls there will be closed for four days this week. The Ministry of Agriculture said that recently, high summer temperatures, Typhoon Danas in July, and heavy rains have made it harder to raise pigs. Also, holidays like the Ghost Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival are coming. These holidays make people want more pork, so prices go up. The ministry has asked Taiwan Sugar Corporation to provide 650 more pigs in August. They think that by October, the supply and demand for pigs will be back to normal.</p>
            <p>Because there are not enough live pigs, nearly 200 pork stalls in Yilan will be closed for more days this week. They will close on August 14th, making it a four-day weekend. They will only be open on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. They will meet again on the 15th to decide if they need to close more days next week.</p>
            <p>Information from the Central Animal Production Association's daily pig market shows that on August 8th, 21,034 pigs were sold. The price was 111.39 New Taiwan Dollars per kilogram. On August 9th, 12,184 pigs were sold, and the price was 112.69 New Taiwan Dollars per kilogram.</p>
            <p>Zhou Zhixun, who is a deputy director at the Ministry of Agriculture's Animal Husbandry Department, said that recently, hot summer weather has made it harder for pigs to grow well. Also, pig diseases, rules about protecting the environment, and storms and heavy rains in July have caused problems. This has made the total number of pigs available in Taiwan less for a short time. Also, with the Ghost Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival coming, more people want to buy pork. This makes the price go up, which is a normal part of how the market works.</p>
            <p>Zhou Zhixun thinks that as the weather gets better and pig farms start producing more, the number of pigs available and the price will probably go back to normal around October. He said that fewer pigs is a problem for the whole country. The Ministry of Agriculture has already asked Taiwan Sugar Corporation to provide 650 more pigs in August. They are also telling frozen meat factories to buy less and asking markets to close for some days to help control the supply. They have also asked farmers to sell pigs in an orderly way. The ministry will keep watching the market and adjust things when needed to keep the supply and sales stable.</p>
            <p>Reports show that eight years ago, Yilan County had 200,000 pigs. But as the economy grew, this number went down each year. Now, there are only 50,000 pigs left. Most of the pork needed in Yilan comes from other parts of Taiwan. Yilan County usually needs about 350 to 380 pigs each day. Since the Dragon Boat Festival, this has gone up to 400 pigs, and now there is not enough pork.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon is Coming, Councilor Worries About Lake Breaking; Hualien County Government Makes Evacuation Plan.</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Yangliu is getting closer to Taiwan. Hualien County Councilor Wei Jia-xian is worried that a lake formed by a landslide in the upper part of Mataian Stream might break open. The county government said they have already made a list of families who need help. The fire department is also making a plan for people to leave their homes safely. They will practice this plan soon.</p>
            <p>The weather office said today that they expect to warn ships about Typhoon Yangliu on the morning of August 12th. They will warn people on land in the evening or night. Even though the typhoon's path might change a little north or south, it will still affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>A big landslide happened in the national forest area above Mataian Stream in Wanrong Township. This was caused by the outer winds of Typhoon Wipha. The landslide blocked the river, making a lake (a landslide dam). The Forest and Nature Conservation Agency's Hualien office looked at the lake. If the water overflows, it could affect areas downstream. These areas include the Mataian Stream Bridge on Highway 9, other river structures, and villages along the river.</p>
            <p>If we look at the affected areas by village, they include Mingli Village in Wanrong Township, Dama Village, Taiping Village, and Dongfu Village in Guangfu Township. Also, Changqiao Village, Darong Village, and Shanxing Village in Fenglin Township are affected.</p>
            <p>Rao Zhong, who is acting as the Secretary-General for Hualien County Government, told the Central News Agency that the Forest and Nature Conservation Agency is still watching the lake upstream. The water level in the Mataian Stream landslide lake is indeed higher than it has been in recent years. They are also worried that Typhoon Yangliu might make the water overflow sooner. To keep the people of Hualien safe, they need to act quickly.</p>
            <p>Rao Zhong said that seven villages downstream could be affected. He has told the three local government offices in Fenglin, Wanrong, and Guangfu to prepare lists of people who need help. They also need to check what vehicles can be used to move people. At the same time, the fire department will make a plan for leaving homes safely. They will practice this plan as soon as possible. He also reminded all government departments to "prepare for the worst, and do their best to be ready."</p>
            <p>Independent county councilor Wei Jia-xian said today that the landslide lake above Mataian Stream is as big as Nanhua Reservoir. Based on what officials are seeing at the site, the water is only about 79 meters away from overflowing. The lake holds 920,000 cubic meters of water each day. They thought it would overflow in mid-October. But Typhoon Yangliu might bring too much rain, making it overflow earlier.</p>
            <p>Wei Jia-xian said, "This is a typical combined disaster. We have little time, things change fast, and many areas will be affected. Our usual plans for disasters are not enough." He said they must act now. This includes setting up a joint command center with central and local government to make sure decisions and information are clear and shared. The Forest and Nature Conservation Agency, Water Resources Agency, Fire Agency, and the county government need to work together.</p>
            <p>Wei Jia-xian also said they need to set clear rules for when people must leave. These rules should be based on how fast the water rises, how much the dam moves, and the total rainfall. If these levels are met, people must leave immediately from different areas. They also need more ways to watch the lake and get live video. This will help central and local governments and people on the ground know about the water level and dam condition at the same time. They also need to check their evacuation plans and arrange transportation and shelters early to make sure people who cannot move easily can leave safely.</p>

            <h1>White House Advisor for Cryptocurrency, Bo Hines, Says He is Leaving and Going Back to Private Work.</h1>
            <p>Bo Hines, who was in charge of President Trump's group for digital money, said today that he is leaving his job. He will go back to working for a private company.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that last month, a group of government workers, led by Hines, talked about the Trump government's ideas for laws about digital money that are "defined by the market." They also asked US government groups that control money to make new rules for digital money.</p>
            <p>Hines wrote on X today, "It has been a great honor in my life to work for the Trump government and to work with David Sacks, our wonderful AI and cryptocurrency expert, as the head of the White House Cryptocurrency Committee."</p>
            <p>David Sacks said good things about Hines in a reply to Hines's post about leaving his job.</p>
            <p>Hines tried to become a member of Congress for North Carolina two times before, but he did not win.</p>
            <p>Last month, President Trump signed a law called the "GENIUS Act." This law aims to create rules for digital money that is linked to the US dollar, called stablecoins. This important law could make it possible for US dollar stablecoins to be used for everyday payments and sending money.</p>
            <p>Hines supported the making of the "GENIUS Act" law.</p>
