            <h1>Canadian Official: Trump and Carney May Talk in Days</h1>
            <p>A Canadian official said today that U.S. President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Carney will probably talk in the next few days. This comes after the U.S. said it would raise taxes on Canadian goods not covered by the "U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement" to 35%.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Dominic LeBlanc, the Canadian minister in charge of trade with the U.S., also spoke on the CBS news show "Face the Nation." He said he felt positive about recent talks. He believes it is still possible to reach an agreement to lower the taxes.</p>
            <p>LeBlanc said, "We are hopeful after talking with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. But we need to make a deal that is best for both countries, and we haven't done that yet."</p>
            <p>He added that he expects Carney and Trump to talk "in the next few days."</p>
            <p>LeBlanc stated, "We think it is possible to reach an agreement to lower some of these taxes and make it more certain for investments."</p>
            <p>Washington had said they would put taxes on Canada partly because Canada did not stop the illegal trade of the strong pain medicine fentanyl.</p>

            <h1>US Trade Representative: New Tariffs Are Mostly Set</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, said in an interview today that the new U.S. tax rates on goods are "mostly set." He said there is little chance to change them right away. He also defended President Trump's decision to put taxes on Brazil for political reasons.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Trump uses taxes on goods as a way to show America's economic power. He has set taxes from 10% to 41% on goods from many countries, including the European Union. These new taxes will start on August 7th.</p>
            <p>Greer said in an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation" that was shown today that these tax rates are not likely to change "in the next few days."</p>
            <p>He explained, "Many of these tax rates are based on agreements. Some of these agreements have been made public, and some have not. Others depend on how much more or less we trade with that country."</p>
            <p>He added, "These tax rates are mostly set."</p>
            <p>He also said that some trade ministers "want to talk more to see how they can work with the U.S. in different ways." But, he noted, "with these tax rates, we can now truly see the full plan of the President's taxes."</p>
            <p>On July 31st, Trump announced the new tax rates on many trade partners, starting August 7th.</p>
            <p>Brazil, which is the biggest economy in South America, will face much higher taxes. Their goods sent to the U.S. will have a 50% tax. However, many important products like airplanes and orange juice will not have this tax.</p>
            <p>Trump openly said he put taxes on Brazil because his political friend, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, was charged with a crime. Trump called Bolsonaro's case a "witch hunt."</p>
            <p>Greer said it is not unusual for Trump to use taxes for political reasons.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Kevin Hassett, a White House economic advisor, said that talks with some U.S. trade partners might continue next week. But he agreed with Greer about the taxes, saying that most of the rates are "more or less decided."</p>
            <p>On NBC News's "Meet the Press," the host Kristen Welker asked Hassett if Trump might change the tax rates if the financial markets react badly.</p>
            <p>Hassett replied, "I would say no to that idea, because these are final agreements."</p>

            <h1>Southwest Winds Bring Heavy Rain Risk to Kaohsiung-Pingtung Mountains</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration (CWA) has issued a heavy rain warning today. This is because of southwest winds, which can cause strong rain for short periods. The mountain areas of Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County will have heavy rain or very heavy rain. There is also a chance of heavy rain in Penghu, Kinmen, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and the mountain areas from Nantou to Tainan.</p>
            <p>The CWA reminds people to be careful of lightning and strong winds. Also, low areas might have standing water or floods. Because it has been raining for many days, people in mountain areas should watch out for loose soil, landslides, rockfalls, and mudslides. It is best to avoid going to mountain areas.</p>
