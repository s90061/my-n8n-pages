Heyue, a real estate company, announced that its revenue in June was NT$431 million, which is 30.83% less than the same time last year. This is because fewer homes were sold. However, compared to May, June's revenue went up by 13.97%. In the first half of this year, Heyue's revenue was NT$3.25 billion, a 17.45% drop from last year.

Heyue expects that new building projects in Taichung and New Taipei will help increase their income in the second half of the year. Some of these projects are expected to get their building permits in early July, and others will be finished and ready for sale.

The company also noted that building companies are now lowering their prices by 15% to 20%. If this continues, it could help more people buy homes, which would be good for Heyue and the real estate market.

**Hong Kong Government Plans Law Change: Can Stop Prisoners from Contacting Certain Lawyers for National Security Reasons**

The Hong Kong government wants to change its prison rules. These changes would allow them to limit how prisoners and people waiting for trial can see visitors and lawyers. This includes stopping them from talking to specific lawyers or law firms if it is believed to be a risk to national security. Also, prisoners and those waiting for trial would not be able to have visitors unless the Commissioner of Correctional Services gives permission.

The government stated that some people have used visits to prisoners to cause problems. They say these visitors have tried to make prisoners angry at the government and turn them into potential risks to national security after they leave prison.

The new rules would also say that visits must help prisoners become better people, keep in touch with their families, or offer emotional or practical support. The Correctional Services Department would be able to refuse visits that do not meet these goals or put limits on them. The government also wants to stop prisoners from giving unauthorized items to their lawyers during visits. A judge could issue an order to prevent prisoners from communicating with specific lawyers or law firms. However, prisoners could still get advice from other lawyers they choose. Also, prisoners waiting for trial would no longer be allowed to wear their own clothes or receive food from outside, as these practices are seen as security risks.

**Diver Dies at CPC Guanyin Terminal: Work Stops, Investigation Underway**

A diver sadly died yesterday while working at CPC Corporation's Guanyin (Third Gas Receiving) Terminal. CPC said that work at the site has stopped for now, but this will not affect the project's overall timeline. The Northern Occupational Safety and Health Center said that it seems the diver's mask connector came off, leading to water getting in. If safety rules were broken, fines will be issued.

The 34-year-old diver, Mr. Li, became unconscious while working underwater and was pronounced dead after being brought to shore and taken to the hospital.

CPC stated that when Mr. Li was pulled out of the water, his breathing equipment was detached. The company immediately told the contractor to stop all related work. They also sent staff to the hospital to support Mr. Li's family. The Third Gas Receiving Terminal project had already completed its first gas supply tests in March and full gas supply tests in June.

After looking into the accident, the Northern Occupational Safety and Health Center believes the diver's mask connector came off, causing him to drown. If it is found that safety laws were not followed, the employer could be fined up to NT$300,000, and the main company could be fined up to NT$150,000. This is the second accident involving the same contractor, so any fines will be increased. Work at the site has been ordered to stop.
