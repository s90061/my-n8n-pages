            <h1>Japan to Increase Taxes on Cheap Imports from China</h1>
            <p>Japan will start taxing more goods that come from China indirectly. This is because China makes too many products, which hurts Japanese businesses.</p>
            <p>The main issue is that China produces a lot of steel and other materials. Even though people in China don't buy as much, factories keep making a lot. So, China sells these extra products to other countries at low prices.</p>
            <p>For example, in March, Japan put a temporary tax on graphite electrodes from China. These are used to melt scrap metal. After the tax, less graphite electrodes came directly from China. But then, more came from other countries that don't even make graphite electrodes themselves.</p>
            <p>This suggests that China might be sending partly finished graphite electrodes to these other countries. Then, those countries finish the products and send them to Japan.</p>
            <p>More and more Chinese products are reaching Japan through countries like India or countries in Southeast Asia. Japanese companies that make steel and chemicals want the government to stop these indirect ways of selling goods.</p>
            <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) says that anti-dumping taxes are okay. These taxes stop cheap imports from harming local businesses. If a country sells a product for much less abroad than at home, a special tax can be added to cover the difference.</p>
            <p>Among the G20 countries, only Japan and Indonesia do not have rules to stop these indirect exports.</p>
            <p>Japan's Ministry of Finance started a special group in September to create these rules. In their first meeting on September 10, they suggested taxing third countries. This would happen if it is clear that these countries are helping China avoid taxes and if Japanese companies are losing money because of it.</p>
            <p>To decide if a country is helping to avoid taxes, they will look at different things. For example, they will check if a lot of extra work or investment is done in the third country. If more than 60% of the value of a product from a third country comes from a country that Japan has already put an anti-dumping tax on, then a higher tax can be added. Also, if the extra value added in the third country is less than about 25%, the product can also be taxed.</p>
            <p>The European Union already has a similar system with the same rules about these percentages.</p>
            <p>Professor Yoshinori Abe, who leads the group, said they need a system that can be changed easily. He explained that people might always find new ways to avoid taxes, even with new rules.</p>
            <p>The Japanese government will ask for people's opinions. They hope to finish changing the laws by the year 2026.</p>

            <h1>Two States Sue to Stop Trump from Sending Soldiers to Portland</h1>
            <p>The US Defense Department announced that President Trump is moving about 200 National Guard members from Los Angeles, California, to Portland, Oregon. These soldiers were already under federal control. Both California and Oregon have started a lawsuit in federal court to stop this order.</p>
            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on social media that this is a very bad use of power and law. He said that Trump's government is directly attacking the law. Governor Newsom thought that around 300 National Guard members would be sent.</p>
            <p>California has now joined a lawsuit that Oregon already started. Together, they want to stop the National Guard from being sent to both states.</p>
            <p>The day before, a judge in Oregon temporarily stopped Trump from sending Oregon's own National Guard to Portland. The judge said there was no proof that the recent protests there needed soldiers.</p>
            <p>However, a spokesperson for the US Defense Department, Sean Parnell, sent an email saying that about 200 California National Guard members have been moved to Portland. He said this was ordered by the President. Their job is to help federal workers, including those from ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). They will help to enforce federal laws and protect federal buildings.</p>
            <p>There was a slight difference in the number of soldiers mentioned by the Defense Department and California's Governor. The Governor's office later said that 300 soldiers would be sent to Portland, and 200 of them were already on their way.</p>
            <p>A changed lawsuit document stated that 300 National Guard members from Southern California were under federal control until early November. But their leaders were told recently that these 300 people would "soon be moved to Portland."</p>
            <p>The lawsuit strongly stated that the President can only use the National Guard in special situations. These include stopping an invasion, stopping a rebellion, or making sure federal laws are followed. The lawsuit repeated, "There is no rebellion happening in Portland right now."</p>
            <p>The lawsuit also said that Trump had sent these National Guard members to Los Angeles in June to work on immigration laws. Now, there is no legal reason to move them to Oregon for different tasks.</p>
            <p>On September 2, a federal judge had stopped Trump's government from using the National Guard to help California fight crime. But this decision is paused because the government has appealed it. So, the soldiers going to Oregon are still under federal control and listen to President Trump.</p>
            <p>The National Guard is a military group based in each state. They usually follow orders from their state governors. They only follow federal orders when the federal government officially calls them for service.</p>

            <h1>Special Weekly Meeting at the Zoo: German Man Visits His Gorilla Friend</h1>
            <p>JÃ¼rgen Winterstein, an old man from Germany, visits his gorilla friend named Melima every week at the Hanover Zoo. Melima is 29 years old, and they have been friends for over 25 years. Mr. Winterstein brings photo albums that show Melima's family and her life. Melima loves to look at these pictures.</p>
            <p>The writer of this article visited the Hanover Zoo before going back to Berlin. The zoo is in the middle of the city. A long time ago, rich people used to keep rare animals from around the world there.</p>
            <p>In the 1800s, zoos became very important public places. As cities grew, zoos gave people a nice green place to walk and relax.</p>
            <p>When the writer walked through the Hanover Zoo in the 2000s, she saw pink flamingos eating in the swamp and grey rhinos that looked like the rocks. There were not many visitors because it was not a weekend. It felt like walking into the animals' own homes, and the writer walked softly so as not to bother them.</p>
            <p>When she reached the gorilla area, she heard some noise. She saw Mr. Winterstein sitting by a glass window. He was showing a book to two gorillas.</p>
            <p>The writer asked if he was reading a storybook to them. He smiled and said no. He pointed to the book and said, "This is their family photo album."</p>
            <p>Mr. Winterstein is a regular visitor at the Hanover Zoo. He visits Melima every week. He said, "We have known each other for 25 years!" He knows all about Melima's family. Her mother, Sonja, died 15 years ago. Her sister, Naomi, lives in a zoo in Sweden. Melima also has three daughters, and each one has a different personality.</p>
            <p>Mr. Winterstein opened a bag next to him. Inside were 6 or 7 photo albums that he had made. He said Melima really likes to see photos of her family and herself. Over the past 25 years, Mr. Winterstein has taken pictures of Melima growing up and put them into books. Now that he is retired, he brings these photo albums to the zoo every week to visit his old friend.</p>
            <p>He laughed and said, "Today I have been here for 6 hours already." Mr. Winterstein often stays for a whole afternoon. He looks at the photo albums with Melima and talks to her. Sometimes, Melima taps on the glass to tell him to turn the page. Other times, she points to his bag to show she wants to see the next book, not letting him leave.</p>
            <p>While they were talking, Mr. Winterstein asked where the writer was from. When he heard "Taipei," his eyes lit up. He said, "I watch videos of the gorillas at Taipei Zoo every day!" He then excitedly told them about D'jeeco, the male gorilla at Muzha Zoo, and his family.</p>
            <p>On October 1, Dr. Jane Goodall, a British expert on apes who spent her life helping gorillas, passed away. The writer thought about the friendship between Mr. Winterstein and Melima, which has lasted for more than 25 years. She searched online but could not find any German news or social media stories about their special friendship.</p>
            <p>The writer felt bad that she did not get Mr. Winterstein's contact details when she met him. She was waiting for the Hanover Zoo to reply to her request to contact him.</p>
            <p>Meetings between people are often very brief and special, unlike the long friendship between Mr. Winterstein and the gorilla Melima. As a writer, she felt it was important to write down these stories and remember the warm moments and conversations she had, using her memory and the photos she took.</p>
            <p>Even now, she still remembers Melima watching Mr. Winterstein leave, and Mr. Winterstein stopping with his bag, turning back, and waving goodbye with a smile. The gorilla area at the zoo, called "Afri-Mountain," is about 0.3 hectares. It is designed to look like a natural African place with rocks, rivers, and dry wood, so the gorillas can live in an environment similar to their home.</p>
