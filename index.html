            <h1>China's GDP Looks Good in the First Half of the Year, But People Don't Feel It: Experts Explain Why</h1>
            <p>China's economy grew by 5.3% in the first half of the year. This looks like a good result, especially with the impact of tariffs. But many people in China do not feel that the economy is doing well. An expert in economics said this is because the actual growth, called "nominal GDP," was only 4.3%. Also, the economy is divided, and wealth is not shared equally. This means China's economic situation is more serious than many think.</p>
            <p>On August 4, Zhao Jian, head of Xijing Institute, shared his analysis of China's economic data for the first half of the year on the WeChat public account "Chief Economist Forum."</p>
            <p>Zhao Jian explained that the data for the first half of the year showed the impact of the tariff war was less than expected. Exports continued to support half of the economy. The "two major, two new" policies helped a lot. Also, different national and local bonds were released early. Many large projects were started. In the first half of the year, 60% of the year's tasks were finished. All of these things together led to the 5.3% economic growth rate.</p>
            <p>So, why do people's everyday experiences seem so different from the overall economic numbers? He pointed out that while the actual GDP grew by 5.3% in the first half, the nominal GDP only grew by 4.3%. As of the second quarter of this year, China's GDP deflator (which compares nominal GDP to real GDP) has been negative for nine quarters in a row. The deflator in the second quarter was even lower than in the first quarter. This shows that the economy is facing a lot of pressure from deflation, which means prices are falling.</p>
            <p>Nominal GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a certain period, calculated using current market prices. It includes the effect of price levels.</p>
            <p>The GDP deflator has been negative for nine quarters, meaning prices have been falling for more than two years. Zhao Jian said that when prices generally fall, and there is deflation, the real burden of debt increases a lot. This causes many businesses to go bankrupt and many people to lose their jobs. It also makes the problems of low demand and too much supply even worse.</p>
            <p>Zhao Jian also said that how people feel about the economy depends on their job, their area, and their age. Falling prices affect private businesses, small businesses, and businesses that sell to consumers more than large state-owned companies and businesses that produce raw materials. Falling prices are better for retired people who receive a fixed pension than for young people who just graduated. And falling prices affect middle-class people with high debts the most.</p>
            <p>Industries that used to benefit the middle class, like real estate, tutoring, and digital platforms, are now shrinking because of economic cycles and government policies. Many white-collar middle-class people are also facing financial difficulties. Especially those with high debts will feel the pain of this social change even more.</p>
            <p>Zhao Jian stated that even though GDP growth is 5.3%, the money from government policies is not spread evenly. Most of the money goes to large state-owned companies, the government, banks, and a very small group of people. In the past, when growth helped everyone, it was through industries like real estate, which affected over 50 other industries.</p>
            <p>Finally, Zhao Jian pointed out that the 5.3% growth in the first half of the year came from using up many policy tools. Also, the risks from the China-US tariff war are still there for the future. If the government starts to reduce its support policies and the break in the China-US tariff war ends, then it will be very hard to keep growth stable in the second half of the year. If the real estate market does not become stable, the overall economy in the second half of the year will likely not improve much.</p>
            <p>He believes that China's economy is in a very urgent situation. In the second half of the year, more powerful policies are needed for real estate and consumer spending. Only then can China successfully reach its goals for this year. This means not just reaching 5% GDP growth, but also making sure the CPI (Consumer Price Index) is close to 2%. This was the goal set by the government at the start of the year, and it should not be too much lower than that.</p>

            <h1>Li Chun: Comparing Taiwan-US Tariff Talks to "Black Box" Trade Agreement is Clearly Wrong</h1>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) released a press statement today. It said that DPP spokesperson Han Ying spoke live with Li Chun, who is leaving his role as Taiwan's representative to the EU. Li Chun stressed that temporary tariffs are common in international trade. Also, signing secrecy agreements in trade talks is necessary for efficiency and meeting deadlines. He said that comparing this to the "black box" (secret) nature of the Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA) is clearly not right.</p>
            <p>Li Chun explained that "temporary tariffs" or "temporary trade agreements" are very common in international trade. For example, when the EU and Canada signed their free trade agreement (FTA), the EU has 27 members. The agreement was "provisional" before all member countries approved it.</p>
            <p>Regarding some lawmakers' questions about the tariff secrecy agreement being a "black box," Li Chun said that all trade talks involve signing secrecy agreements. This is based on trust between the two sides. It prevents information from leaking out and stops the talks from being affected. Also, both sides have people with strong interests. To make the talks efficient and timely, it is important to keep the agreement secret until it is final.</p>
            <p>Li Chun stated that comparing the current tariff talks to the "Service Trade Agreement" from before is clearly wrong.</p>
            <p>He gave examples before, during, and after the talks. Before the CSSTA talks, people didn't know who Taiwan was talking to, and the public knew nothing. But with the Taiwan-US tariff talks, everyone knew about them since April, and people encouraged the government to start talks quickly. So, the "before" stage was different for both. Also, it is important to announce who you are talking with. The CSSTA talks were with China, which is a sensitive partner, but this was not revealed. For the Taiwan-US talks, the US is an important ally, and everyone knows about it. So, the sensitivity of the partners is also different.</p>
            <p>He added that during the CSSTA talks, people didn't know what was happening. But during the Taiwan-US talks, the Executive Yuan (Taiwan's Cabinet) has reported how many times officials went and when they left and returned. After the talks, the agreement will go to the Legislative Yuan (Taiwan's Parliament) for review. President Lai Ching-te also said it would definitely be sent to the Legislative Yuan for approval, following democratic rules. The CSSTA was meant to be passed in three minutes at the last moment, with a single vote, without letting people know the content. So, when comparing before, during, and after, the CSSTA clearly cannot be compared to the Taiwan-US tariff talks.</p>
            <p>Li Chun warned that the US might still change the tariffs they have already agreed on. This has happened before with Mexico and Canada.</p>
            <p>Li Chun also explained how Taiwan can deal with the impact of US tariffs. First, Taiwanese companies need to make their products better to keep their market share in the US. Second, they can think about moving their main market to Europe. Third, the government must help companies understand the European market. Fourth, they should improve product quality to reduce the impact of tariffs.</p>
            <p>Regarding the issue of China's BYD cars trying to enter Taiwan by "laundering their origin" through a third country, Li Chun said that Chinese electric cars entering Taiwan are not just a competition problem. There are also national security concerns about the related electronic parts. Even if they try to hide where they come from through other countries, Taiwan should still ban them.</p>
            <p>Li Chun suggested that Taiwan can make rules about products and where they come from. For example, electric cars are high-risk products, so any Chinese brand should be banned. For the origin of products, Li Chun used the example of Brexit (the UK leaving the EU) and said that it needs a more careful look and discussion.</p>
            <p>Han Ying asked everyone to support the government, which is working hard. She hopes that all political parties will work together to support the negotiation team and achieve the best result.</p>

            <h1>Truck Driver Gets Electric Shock, Taiwan Railway Line Between Hukou and Xinfeng Was Blocked for a Time</h1>
            <p>Today, a truck driver accidentally got an electric shock while driving on a railway crossing between Hukou and Xinfeng on the Taiwan Railway line. His truck got stuck because its cargo was too high. This caused both railway lines in that area to be blocked for a while. Taiwan Railway said that after the railway police handled the situation, both lines are now open for trains again.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railway Company sent a message saying that today at 2:45 PM, a truck was crossing at the Tangrong railway crossing (K94+787) between Hukou and Xinfeng in Hsinchu. The truck got stuck under a height limit bar because the goods on it were too tall. The driver tried to fix it and accidentally got an electric shock. An ambulance took him to the hospital at 2:58 PM.</p>
            <p>This incident stopped trains on both lines between Hukou and Xinfeng for some time. Taiwan Railway said that after the railway police dealt with the situation, both lines between Xinfeng and Hukou were back to normal at 3:38 PM.</p>
