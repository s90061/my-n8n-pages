            <h1>Taiwan Biotech's First-Half Revenue Reaches New High, Three Key Plans for Global Growth</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 20 â€“ Taiwan Biotech, a company that makes generic medicines, reached a new record for revenue in the first half of this year. Their net profit after tax and earnings per share (EPS) also grew compared to last year. General Manager Hou Ching-lan said that the company's three main plans remain the same: bringing in new international medicines, making new medicines in Taiwan, and selling difficult-to-make generic medicines to other countries. She believes the company will continue to expand in the global market and expects this year's business to be even better than last year.</p>
            <p>In the first half of the year, Taiwan Biotech's revenue was NT$2.97 billion, which is 12% more than last year and a new record for this period. The profit belonging to the parent company was NT$676 million, a 24.5% increase from last year. Earnings per share (EPS) were NT$2.72. During an online meeting today, Hou Ching-lan said that the revenue grew because existing products continued to sell well, and their own generic medicine for severe fungal infections in the body has been selling more and more in the United States.</p>
            <p>Also, the company's profit was helped by its investment in Standard Chemical & Pharmaceutical, which merged with a distributor in April last year. In addition, sales of their medicine for high cholesterol are growing, which also helps the group's income. Other good sales come from their cancer medicines, medicines for serious illnesses, and health products.</p>
            <p>She explained that Taiwan Biotech's main plans have not changed in recent years. They are working on three things at the same time: getting licenses to bring in new medicines from other countries, making their own new medicines in Taiwan, and selling generic medicines that are hard to make to other countries.</p>
            <p>Regarding bringing in new international medicines, they find promising products and expand into global markets by getting licenses and working with distributors. For example, they distribute cell-based flu vaccines from CSL Seqirus. This year, the number of government-funded vaccines they won in bids increased to 790,000 doses. Sales of both government-funded and private flu vaccines have been growing over the past few years, and flu vaccine revenue is expected to reach a new high this year. This year, they are also working with Taiwan Roche again on an oral targeted medicine.</p>
            <p>For making their own new medicines in Taiwan, she said they want to make more new medicines themselves. One of these is the new antibiotic medicine Bobimixyn, which was launched at the end of last year. It is a very important medicine for patients' needs and has already been supplied to dozens of hospitals.</p>
            <p>Regarding selling difficult-to-make generic medicines to other countries, she said that Lipo-AB continues to reach new sales records in the United States. They are now trying to sell it in other areas too.</p>
            <p>She pointed out that for Taiwan Biotech to be a global pharmaceutical company, it is very important that their factories pass inspections. Both of their factories, located in Liudu and Zhongli, passed inspections by the United States in July this year. This is very important for selling Taiwan Biotech's products abroad. A new lung cancer medicine is expected to get its license in the fourth quarter of this year. It is also an important targeted medicine for lung cancer.</p>

            <h1>"We TAIWAN" is a Huge Success in Osaka, Japanese Visitors Call It "The Taiwan Pavilion"</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 20 â€“ The "We TAIWAN: Taiwan Culture in Osaka and Kansai Expo" event went to Japan and won the hearts of many Japanese people in 19 days. Some people drew their own comic stories about the mascot "a-We," or they wanted to visit Taiwan because of it. Some visitors even said, comparing it to their Osaka Expo experience, "This is the Taiwan Pavilion."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture organized the "We TAIWAN" event. Starting in May, the "a-We" character announced that Taiwan would be part of the Expo. Products related to "a-We" were already selling well before the event, and during the event, people rushed to buy them. Many Japanese people also visited the actual event space to take photos with the "a-We" statues. Online, many people created their own comics and drawings of the mascot.</p>
            <p>The Taiwanese teams brought many different activities, including crafts, art, drama, literature, and movies. The Ministry of Culture announced today that many people were surprised by how advanced Taiwan's cultural technology is. One visitor who experienced the audio-described version of "Huang Yi & KUKA" said, "People who can hear or cannot hear, see or cannot see, can all enjoy it and feel fully considered."</p>
            <p>One visitor who watched a Taiwanese movie wrote, "I truly hope that Taiwan's bright, warm, and kind culture, and the peaceful and hardworking lives of its people, can last forever." Another Japanese fan of traditional Taiwanese puppet theater used AI to write puppet show lines. When members of the New Sheng Jing Troupe from Taiwan read them to her, the Japanese fan was so moved that she cried.</p>
            <p>Wu Ji-juan, one of the main creators and the head of production for the cultural technology shows, shared that more than 80% of the visitors had never experienced Taiwanese performances before. One visitor who watched 4 VR (virtual reality) works in one day said, "Thank you for planning so many shows. It really made me feel a different Taiwan." Seeing that visitors wanted to learn more about or looked forward to visiting Taiwan, she thought, "I believe this is the main goal of We TAIWAN organizing large events around the world."</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-ying, the head planner for the "Taiwan Spectrum" exhibition, said that as a Taiwanese person, he always remembers that the most valuable cultural power is to believe first, not to wait until the world notices us before speaking. "We TAIWAN" is an action to invite the world to learn about Taiwan. When he heard a visitor say, "This is not just an exhibition, it is a journey to understand Taiwan," he knew at that moment that "we did something right. Taiwanese culture was not just seen, but it was believed in."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture stated that "We TAIWAN" welcomes everyone with an open mind and many choices, allowing them to find what they like and see different sides of Taiwanese culture. Many visitors who came from the Expo Yumeshima area said, "This is the Taiwan Pavilion."</p>
