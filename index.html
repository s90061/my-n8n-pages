            <h1>Semiconductor Exhibition Focuses on Advanced Packaging; NVIDIA's Interest Affects CoWoP Progress</h1>
            <p>The SEMICON Taiwan 2025 international semiconductor exhibition is happening this week. The event will focus on advanced packaging technologies. Besides CoWoS, people are also looking at new developments in FOPLP, CoPoS, and CoWoP. NVIDIA, a big company that makes AI chips, likes these technologies, and their choices will affect how advanced packaging grows in the future.</p>
            <p>It is becoming harder to make smaller semiconductor chips. Also, modern chips for AI and very powerful computers need different parts to work together. This means they need advanced packaging to work better. Advanced packaging is no longer just a small part of making advanced chips; it is now a main technology for making high-end chips work better.</p>
            <p>Besides CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate), InFO, and SoIC technologies led by TSMC, other technologies are also important. These include CoPoS (Chip on Panel on Substrate), which is a panel-based CoWoS technology, FOPLP (Fan-Out Panel Level Packaging), and CoWoP (Chip-on-Wafer-on-PCB), which NVIDIA is said to be interested in.</p>
            <p>Large-size FOPLP is a key focus for Taiwanese companies. Innolux has successfully changed some of its display production lines to make FOPLP packages this year. Powertech Technology is also working hard on FOPLP lines and expects to make money from them by 2027. ASE Technology Holding has invested 200 million US dollars to build large FOPLP lines in Kaohsiung. Also, Hiwin Technologies, a company that makes motion control parts, is working on FOPLP wafer transfer equipment. Yield Engineering Systems, an equipment maker, has received orders for FOPLP testing equipment.</p>
            <p>Manz AG is working on equipment for making Re-Distribution Layers (RDL) using glass substrates. This is used in panel-level advanced packaging. Titon is supplying related equipment and is working with European companies that make power management chips.</p>
            <p>From the customers' side, experts say that companies like NXP, STMicroelectronics, AMD, and Qualcomm are working with Taiwanese companies to use panel-level packaging. This technology is used for power management chips in phones, cars, and wearable devices. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite radio frequency (RF) chips will also use FOPLP. In the future, FOPLP might be used for AI chips.</p>
            <p>Regarding CoPoS technology, it is said that TSMC might set up its first CoPoS trial line in 2026 through its subsidiary, VisEra Technologies. It might even be produced at TSMC's new advanced packaging and testing plant in Chiayi. The goal is to start mass production by the end of 2028 or 2029.</p>
            <p>Experts explain that CoPoS panel-level packaging can change "round to square" shapes, which helps use more of the wafer area. It can also use glass interposers instead of silicon interposer through-holes, and glass substrates instead of organic substrates. This helps with the problem of warping in large panel-level packaging and makes costs more competitive. It can also improve how quickly data is sent. This is why it is a very important advanced packaging technology.</p>
            <p>Companies in the CoPoS supply chain in Taiwan that investment firms have mentioned include InnoLux, Crystalwise Technology, GPM, K&S, GigaForce, Chroma ATE, ULVAC, STI, Scientech, CSun, Innolux, Unimicron, Nanya PCB, Chin-Din, and Compeq.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it is rumored that NVIDIA is thinking about CoWoP technology for future research and development. They might use it in their Rubin Ultra platform, which is expected in the second half of 2027.</p>
            <p>CoWoP technology can skip the step of stacking CoWoS chips on a substrate (Wafer-on-Substrate). Instead, the chip stack (Chip-on-Wafer), which includes a silicon interposer, is placed directly on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). This means the PCB takes over the job of the original substrate.</p>
            <p>American investment experts say that CoWoP technology removes the substrate layer. This allows NVIDIA's NVLink high-speed connection technology to link GPUs directly to the PCB board. This can greatly improve how well AI chips cool down. It can also help avoid problems with limited supply of certain packaging materials and fix issues with warping and cooling for large AI chip advanced packaging.</p>
            <p>However, Asian investment experts point out that there are still problems with making the line width and spacing (L/S) smaller on the PCB board for CoWoP technology. If advanced packaging processes are combined with PCB production, the cleanroom standards will need to be much higher. Overall, the success rate of CoWoP is not yet good enough. It is too early to talk about changing from CoWoS to CoWoP. Whether the supply chain is ready is also key for CoWoP technology to be mass-produced.</p>

            <h1>Paper and Ink Connect Memories of Home: Brazilian Taiwanese Protect Culture</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese people have been moving to Brazil for 70 years. Since Dr. Yang Yu-chi started in 1955, immigrants have worked in farming, sold things on the street, and started businesses in technology. They have shown great strength and new ideas. They keep their culture alive through Chinese schools, newspapers, and events. The second and third generations join the community and help connect different groups. Food, like the "Mapu" snack shop, holds feelings of home and old memories. This journey is not only about moving but also about deep cultural growth with language, education, religion, and food. It helps the spirit of Taiwan continue to grow in Brazil.</p>
            <p>In a part of the immigrant exhibition in SÃ£o Paulo, an old, yellow Chinese newspaper with traditional characters quietly sits in a glass case. The writing looks familiar, and the language feels friendly, like a soft wind blowing from Formosa across the land of South America. It is more than just paper and ink; it is a memory from across half the world, now protecting culture in a foreign land.</p>
            <p>This newspaper is "The American Times," which started as "The American Chinese Post" in 1983. It is the only publication in the Brazilian Chinese community that uses traditional Chinese characters. For many years, it has recorded what is happening in the community and has seen the journey of Taiwanese people making their culture strong in South America.</p>
            <p>For 70 years, the story of Taiwanese immigrants has been more than just starting new businesses. It has been a long journey for their language and culture. In a foreign country, they built churches, grew mushrooms, and planted seeds of culture through education and media.</p>
            <p>For example, the famous Chinese painter Chang Dai-chien moved to Brazil in 1953 and built a Chinese garden called "Eight Virtues Garden" in Mogi das Cruzes. It was an important place for cultural exchange for a while, but the local government took the land to build a dam in the 1980s, and it was flooded. The Chinese Catholic Church in SÃ£o Paulo was the first place for Chinese education. After that, the Chinese Association and different churches started Chinese classes. This made language a bridge to their homeland and helped their culture slowly grow in a new place.</p>
            <p>Also, the Confucius Chinese School not only teaches Chinese, calligraphy, and dance but also gives scholarships and money for learning materials. This helps second-generation Taiwanese people come back to start businesses. They also use online learning platforms to make "Taiwanese-style Chinese" popular in Brazil and encourage Brazilian students to study in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>On the path of passing down culture, the "FASCA" (Brazilian Overseas Youth Cultural Ambassador) program shines a light on new generations. This program is promoted by Taiwan's Overseas Community Affairs Council. It helps young overseas Chinese, from the second and third generations, feel connected to their culture and act in their community through language training and community activities.</p>
            <p>You Zheng-cai, the director of the Education and Culture Center in SÃ£o Paulo, said that training young overseas Chinese locally and having them join community events helps them speak up in a diverse society. They become a bridge and a helper for Taiwanese culture in Brazil.</p>
            <p>When I visited the immigration exhibition and left the culture center, I saw a boy, about 15 or 16 years old, wearing a clean white shirt and black pants. He entered the elevator with everyone else. When he heard some older people ask about the floor, he politely answered right away. His fluent Chinese and polite manner left a deep impression.</p>
            <p>The changes in language show changes in culture. First-generation Taiwanese immigrants spoke Chinese and Taiwanese as their first languages and were Christian. Their lives centered around churches and farms. As time passed, the second and third generations started to speak Portuguese more. Their Chinese skills became weaker, and a gap in language appeared. Many families tried to keep their language strong by taking Chinese classes, but many people now speak a mix of Chinese and Portuguese, creating a blend of languages.</p>
            <p>Tang Chieh-wen, the editor of The American Times supplement, told CNA that developing Chinese language abroad is very important for cultural preservation. By creating a "Chinese Language and Young Writers' Corner," they not only support the hard work of Chinese schools but also give children a chance to share their work. This makes them more interested in learning.</p>
            <p>In addition, yearly events like the Chinese Character Culture Festival, Chinese language tests, and Immigrant Day performances are not just big community events. They are also places for cultural sharing and creative shows. Many second and third-generation Taiwanese immigrants join these events. This makes the events more than just looking back at history; they are a sign of living language and culture.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese immigrant children show their skills in calligraphy, dance, and poetry at these events. They not only show what they have learned but also share traditional culture in new ways, putting the best parts of Taiwanese culture into Brazilian life.</p>
            <p>These activities not only build a bridge for talking between generations but also let older people see that their culture continues. They also help younger people find their identity and confidence by joining in. This is also a sign that Taiwanese culture is growing again in South America, showing that culture is not just saved but keeps growing through new ideas.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Immigrants Turn Around Hardship, Create New Opportunities in Brazil</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese people have been moving to Brazil for 70 years. Since Dr. Yang Yu-chi started in 1955, immigrants have worked in farming, sold things on the street, and started businesses in technology. They have shown great strength and new ideas. They keep their culture alive through Chinese schools, newspapers, and events. The second and third generations join the community and help connect different groups. Food, like the "Mapu" snack shop, holds feelings of home and old memories. This journey is not only about moving but also about deep cultural growth with language, education, religion, and food. It helps the spirit of Taiwan continue to grow in Brazil.</p>
            <p>In Brazil, a country in South America, many rich people are leaving. But Taiwanese people choose to stay. They are not afraid of changing tax rules or political problems. They grow strong and change difficult situations into good ones. In SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, you can see people waiting in line at Taiwanese restaurants and bubble tea shops. This shows how Taiwanese people start businesses in Brazil and how their culture becomes a strong part of the foreign land.</p>
            <p>A study by Henley & Partners, a company that advises on international migration, says that about 1,200 rich Brazilians, who have over a million US dollars, are expected to leave their home country this year. This is a 50% increase from 2024. This wave of people leaving shows serious problems in Brazil with safety, money, and political stability. However, Taiwanese people choose to stay and keep working hard.</p>
            <p>In 1963, a Dutch ship called "Tegelberg" carried six families of believers from farming churches in Yuandou and Xizhou, Changhua. They left Keelung Port and sailed for 49 days. On October 9th, they arrived at Santos Port in Brazil. There were also about 50 other Taiwanese immigrants on the ship.</p>
            <p>After that, they worked step by step in their new country, Brazil, creating a new life for their children and grandchildren.</p>
            <p>From the 1950s to the 1970s, Brazil was a good place for immigrants. Taiwanese people started by selling things from bags. They went from house to house selling tablecloths, jewelry, and watches, and they offered payment plans to find customers. They worked hard and honestly, and their lives in the new country slowly became successful. Many started as street sellers, saved money, and slowly opened stores, becoming stable in business.</p>
            <p>As time went on, Taiwanese business owners started to gather around Rua 25 de MarÃ§o (known as 25th Street) in the center of SÃ£o Paulo. This is one of the largest outdoor shopping areas in Latin America. They also gathered in Liberdade, a neighborhood with a strong East Asian culture. These places became important for Taiwanese immigrants' businesses and for cultural exchange. From selling goods while moving around to having fixed stores, and from working alone to working together as a community, the history of Taiwanese people starting businesses in Brazil is a story of hard work and a strong cultural mark on foreign land.</p>
            <p>After the energy crisis in 1974, Brazil's economy and politics quickly became worse. Inflation spread like a wildfire. A product that cost 10 Brazilian reals in the morning might cost 12 reals in the afternoon. Overseas Taiwanese people liked to save money, but they were forced to use a "two-gold strategy." This meant changing Brazilian reals into US dollars and gold and keeping them at home. But this led to many robberies and uneasy nights. Even with these problems, most Taiwanese people still choose to stay today. This is because they believe that choices are not given by fate, but created by themselves.</p>
            <p>For 70 years, the influence of Taiwanese immigrants has spread like vines in Brazil. Now, most of them are middle-class people and business owners. The second and third generations are very much a part of the local society. The overseas community emphasizes the idea of "roots." This is not just remembering their homeland but also protecting their culture.</p>
            <p>In Mogi das Cruzes, a town near SÃ£o Paulo, silver aluminum mushroom farms stretch along the road. These are not just normal farms; they are a sign of Taiwanese people. They work together to grow mushrooms, formed an association, and coordinated prices and technology. Because of them, 85% of Brazil's mushroom production comes from these immigrants. This is a result of their hard work and a symbol of their unity.</p>
            <p>Today, in the streets of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio, Taiwanese restaurants and bubble tea shops attract people who wait in line. One small restaurant named "Mapu" (Mother's Garden) quietly brings the spirit of Taiwan into daily life in SÃ£o Paulo. It is not just about food; it is a journey about memories, culture, and family love.</p>
            <p>"Mapu" means "Mother's Garden." In 1979, the first-generation immigrant, Mama Lin, who spoke with a strong Taiwanese Hakka accent, moved to SÃ£o Paulo. She told CNA in an interview, "I started cooking because I missed my hometown too much."</p>
            <p>In the restaurant, you can find Taiwanese home-style dishes like miso soy sauce eggplant, slow-cooked pork belly gua bao, and a fragrant bowl of braised pork rice. These dishes are not just tasty; they are also memories of home.</p>
            <p>Today, Mama Lin no longer cooks herself, but she is still the heart of "Mapu," checking and tasting the food. The next-generation owner, Lin Bing-hong, continues to find inspiration from traditional Taiwanese cooking.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Taiwanese immigrants continue to write their stories of success in Brazil in the field of electronics and technology, including companies like BraView Electronics, Jiayong Trading, and Evergreen Industrial.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese people in Brazil are more than just immigrants. For 70 years, they have shown through their actions that they can grow and thrive even in difficult situations. They have allowed the spirit of Taiwan to quietly blossom in South America.</p>
