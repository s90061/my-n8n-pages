            <h1>Poland Announces Reopening of Border with Belarus, China-Europe Trains to Resume</h1>
            <p>Poland announced that it will open its border with Belarus again. This will happen on September 25, early in the morning, local time. Because of this, the China-Europe freight trains will start running again. These trains had stopped on September 12 because Poland closed its border. News from mainland China says that at least 130 China-Europe trains are currently stuck.</p>
            <p>According to CCTV News, on September 23, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the border crossings with Belarus would reopen early on September 25. He also said that if needed, the government could close the border crossings again.</p>
            <p>The financial news agency Yicai reported that Poland closed its border crossings on September 12. At that time, Poland said it was because of the "West-2025" joint military exercise by Russia and Belarus, and later, drone incidents crossing the border. Poland closed all its border crossings (for roads and railways) from September 12 until "the safety of Polish citizens is fully guaranteed."</p>
            <p>After the military exercise ended on September 18, Poland did not say it would open the border with Belarus. Instead, it repeated its earlier decision. Also, on September 22, Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, announced that the first ever Poland-Sweden "Gotland Sentry" (SNEX Gotland Sentry) exercise had officially started.</p>
            <p>Poland's decision to close the border made the China-Europe freight trains, which carry goods from China to Europe, stop. They were stuck in MaÅ‚aszewicze, Poland, which is next to the Belarusian border. MaÅ‚aszewicze is the biggest center in Europe for China-Europe trains. More than 90% of the train transfers and track changes happen there.</p>
            <p>Yicai reported that Yang Jie, the general manager of Eurasian Railway International Freight Forwarding (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., said this situation is very unusual. Since the China-Europe trains started in 2014, the MaÅ‚aszewicze crossing has never been closed. It is the main path for China-Europe trains.</p>
            <p>He also disagreed with some media reports that said "300 trains are stuck, and the value of the goods is as high as 25 billion Euros." He said that the number of trains stuck is not that high, and the value of the goods cannot be that much. The people most affected are customers of China's cross-border e-commerce.</p>
            <p>The report also cited data published by Sichuan New Silk Road Company's WeChat public account "Silk Road Tracker" on September 22. It showed that over the past week, more than 130 China-Europe trains were stuck in Brest, Belarus.</p>
            <p>Yang Jie also said that people in the industry generally believe that Poland will not keep the border closed forever. So, most of his colleagues are waiting to see what happens. He also thinks that in the short term, it will be hard to find a new "alternative route" that can handle the amount of goods that pass through MaÅ‚aszewicze.</p>
            <p>He expects that when the MaÅ‚aszewicze crossing reopens on September 25, there will be a temporary jam. Things will get better after the delayed trains have passed through.</p>

            <h1>Tsing Hua University Leads Discovery of Medium-Mass Black Hole Candidate, Featured on NASA Website</h1>
            <p>An international team, led by Tsing Hua University, has found a possible medium-sized black hole that is eating a star. These medium-sized black holes are like a "missing piece" in the black hole family. They are very rare to see in space. The results of this study are now on the official NASA website.</p>
            <p>Tsing Hua University announced today that black holes are one of the universe's mysteries. They do not shine with their own light. We can only guess they are there by looking at changes in the matter around them. When a black hole eats, the changes in temperature and light intensity help us find them.</p>
            <p>We already know about small black holes and very big black holes. But there is almost no direct proof for "medium-sized black holes," which are in between.</p>
            <p>Professor Kuo-Hsing Chiang from Tsing Hua University's Institute of Astronomy led an international team. They found a rare black hole that might be medium-sized and is eating a star. These "medium-sized black holes" are called the "lost puzzle piece" of black holes. They are very hard to see. This discovery was published in the international journal "The Astrophysical Journal" and also featured on NASA's official website.</p>
            <p>Professor Chiang explained that this discovery happened because something became unusually bright. The light source, called NGC 6099 HLX-1, is in the Hercules constellation. It is about 450 million light-years away from Earth. It was first seen in 2009. In 2012, its brightness grew more than 100 times, then slowly became weaker each year.</p>
            <p>Yi-Chi Chang, a graduate student from Tsing Hua University's Institute of Astronomy and the lead author of the paper, added that such very bright signals usually appear in the center of galaxies and are linked to very big black holes. However, this object, which is at the edge of a galaxy, gave off a very bright X-ray signal. This matches what scientists expect from a medium-sized black hole, so it caught a lot of attention.</p>
            <p>Chang said that medium-sized black holes do not always eat matter and shine brightly for a long time like very big black holes. Also, there are not many of them like small black holes, which are easy to see. Medium-sized black holes are usually quiet. They only send out bright X-ray signals for a short time when they are "eating." This gives astronomers a chance to find them.</p>
            <p>To confirm this object, the research team used the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the XMM-Newton telescope from the European Space Agency. They watched and studied the object for three years.</p>
            <p>The study results showed that the X-ray signal from NGC 6099 HLX-1 in 2012 reached a temperature of about 3 million degrees Celsius. This high temperature happens when a black hole tears apart a star. Around it, there is a thick group of stars, like a "buffet restaurant," which gives the black hole a continuous supply of food.</p>
            <p>Besides the X-ray data, the team also found clues from looking at visible light. By combining this with computer models, they found that the blue light seen around the object might come from changes in temperature of fast-spinning matter near the black hole. The red light is likely related to the thick group of stars nearby. All this evidence together makes this object a strong candidate for a medium-sized black hole. However, more observations are needed to be completely sure.</p>

            <h1>DPP Advance Rescue Team Goes to Hualien, Hsu Kuo-yung Donates 100,000 to Help Disaster Area</h1>
            <p>A lake called Mataan Creek in Hualien overflowed and caused a disaster. Today, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said that its central office has sent an advance rescue team. This team will go to the affected area to help with rescue work. Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung started by donating 100,000 New Taiwan Dollars to help Hualien get back to normal.</p>
            <p>The DPP released a press statement. It said that after the floods in Guangfu Township, Hualien, yesterday evening, the DPP central office quickly responded. Following instructions from Party Chairman Lai Ching-te, Hsu Kuo-yung told all party members and public officials nationwide to help with the disaster relief. Today, the central office formed an advance rescue team. This team will go to the disaster area to help with the rescue tasks that follow.</p>
            <p>The DPP stated that Hsu Kuo-yung told the advance rescue team to work with the local county party office on rescue matters. After the rescue team and the Hualien County party office have checked and gathered information, they will arrange for big machines needed to clean up the disaster area. They will also arrange for supplies needed to help the people who have lost their homes.</p>
            <p>Regarding the serious disaster in Guangfu Township, Hualien, Hsu Kuo-yung asked all people in Taiwan to show the spirit of "one island, one life" and "helping others as if helping ourselves." He urged everyone to do their best to help the people in Hualien rebuild their homes. Hsu Kuo-yung set an example by donating 100,000 New Taiwan Dollars first. This will help Hualien recover from the disaster. Hsu Kuo-yung is also an international director of the Lions Clubs International. He said that other community groups have also started rescue and donation efforts. For example, Li Min-ching, the director of Lions Clubs MD3OO A5 district (which includes Keelung, Yilan, Hualien, and Taitung), has already gone to Hualien to help fully with the rescue.</p>
            <p>The DPP said that its central office will do its best to help with communication and putting together all the rescue work. They hope to quickly provide the most immediate help and support to the people in the disaster area.</p>
