            <h1>Israeli Foreign Minister: Gaza War Could End if Hamas Releases Hostages and Gives Up Weapons</h1>
            <p>Today, Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, spoke at a press conference in Jerusalem with Denmark's Foreign Minister. He said that the war in Gaza could end if Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, lets go of the people they are holding and gives up their weapons.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that yesterday, Hamas repeated its usual stance. They said they would release all the people they are holding if Israel agrees to end the war and removes its soldiers from Gaza City.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Israel bombed a tall building in Gaza City, destroying it. Israel said that Hamas was using the building to "watch" Israeli soldiers. Israel also said it took "steps to reduce harm to civilians."</p>
            <p>Hamas said this attack was wrong. They also said that they do not use homes or other buildings for military reasons.</p>
