            <h1>US Defense Intelligence Agency Leader Removed After Different Report on Iran Nuclear Sites from Trump</h1>
            <p>US officials said today that the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Jeffrey Kruse, and two high-ranking generals have been removed from their jobs. This is the latest in a series of military removals this year. In June, a first report from the DIA disagreed with President Trump's claim that Iran's nuclear facilities were completely destroyed.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Jeffrey Kruse had been the head of the DIA since early 2024. Not long ago, the DIA made an early report. It said that US air attacks only delayed Iran's nuclear program by a few months.</p>
            <p>This report was widely talked about in US media. It was very different from Trump's statement that Iran's nuclear facilities were "totally destroyed." This made Trump and other government officials angry.</p>
            <p>A high-ranking defense official, who did not want to be named, said that Kruse "will no longer be the head of the DIA." But the official did not say why Kruse was leaving.</p>
            <p>Before leading the DIA, Kruse worked as an adviser on military matters for the "Director of National Intelligence." He also led intelligence efforts against the ISIS terrorist group.</p>
            <p>Another unnamed US official said that the other two generals who were removed were Lieutenant General Nancy Lacore, who led the Navy Reserve, and Rear Admiral Milton Sands, who led the Naval Special Warfare Command.</p>
            <p>In June this year, the US carried out big military actions against three nuclear facilities in Iran. They used over 125 airplanes and one missile submarine.</p>
            <p>Trump called these attacks "an amazing military win." He said many times that the US "destroyed" these nuclear facilities. But the DIA's first report made people question what Trump said.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says US Will Get 10% of Intel Shares, Another Example of White House Working with Companies</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that the United States will get 10% of the shares in the chip-making company Intel. This is part of an agreement where government money is exchanged for company shares. This is the newest example of the White House getting involved in American businesses in an unusual way.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, this agreement helps to make the relationship better between Trump and Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger. Trump had previously said that Gelsinger had a conflict of interest and should resign. The agreement will make sure Intel gets about 10 billion US dollars. This money will be used to build new factories or make existing ones bigger in the United States.</p>
            <p>Based on the agreement, the US will buy 9.9% of Intel's shares for 8.9 billion US dollars. This means each share costs 20.47 US dollars. This price is about 4 US dollars cheaper than Intel's closing price today, which was 24.8 US dollars.</p>
            <p>Intel's share price went up by 5.5% today and then by about 1% after the market closed.</p>
            <p>A White House official said that Trump met with Pat Gelsinger today.</p>
            <p>Trump said today, "He came to keep his job, and in the end, he agreed to give us, the United States, 10 billion US dollars. So we got 10 billion US dollars."</p>
            <p>US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Gelsinger reached an agreement that is "good for both Intel and the American people."</p>
            <p>This investment is the latest unusual agreement between the US government and a company. Before this, the US government made a deal with Nvidia, a big company that makes AI chips. This deal allowed Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China, but Nvidia had to give 15% of its sales money to the government.</p>
            <p>Also, the US Department of Defense made a deal with the mining company MP Materials. The government became its biggest shareholder to produce more rare-earth magnets. The US government also got a special "golden share" in the agreement that allows the Japanese company Nippon Steel to buy US Steel. This golden share gives the US government the power to stop the deal.</p>
            <p>The US federal government's wide involvement in business matters has made some people worry. They think that Trump's actions create new risks for companies.</p>
            <p>But some people who watch the industry also question if Intel can solve its problems on its own.</p>
            <p>Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said, "Without government help or other partners with stronger finances, Intel's manufacturing part will find it hard to get enough money to keep building more chip factories at a good speed." He also said that Intel "must keep up with TSMC in technology to get more business."</p>
            <p>Intel said that the US government's shares are just for owning, and the government will not have seats on the board. When shareholders need to agree on something, the government must vote with Intel's board, but there are some "limited exceptions." Intel did not say what these exceptions are.</p>
