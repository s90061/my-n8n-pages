            <p>Before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump spoke to the media. He said if his meeting with Putin does not go well, he will not call anyone.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump spoke on Fox News Radio. He said that if his meeting with Putin goes well, he will call Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. But he also said there is a 25% chance his meeting with Putin will not succeed.</p>

            <h1>CK Hutchison: Port Sale Will Take Longer, Won't Be Done in 2025</h1>
            <p>Chinese financial media reports today that CK Hutchison's management held a meeting for analysts about its mid-year results. They said that the deal to sell the company's port business is now "in a new stage." For example, major Chinese investors have been asked to join the talks. The company hopes to get "approval from all relevant official bodies." They expect the process to take longer than planned, and the sale will not finish in 2025.</p>
            <p>Daily Economic News reported that CK Hutchison's management said at the meeting that selling the port business needs different considerations from "official bodies in different countries."</p>
            <p>CK Hutchison's management said that the company had already stated it would not make any deal until all relevant official bodies and departments approve it. Now, the deal is "in a new stage." For example, "mainland (Chinese) major investors" have been asked to join the discussions. The company hopes to get "approval from all relevant official bodies."</p>
            <p>The report says that CK Hutchison's management expects the process to take longer than planned, and the deal will not finish in 2025.</p>
            <p>On March 4, CK Hutchison announced an agreement in principle with a group including US BlackRock and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). This was to sell 43 port businesses outside Hong Kong, including two ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. This made China very unhappy, and CK Hutchison felt pressure because of it.</p>
            <p>After this, on July 28, CK Hutchison announced on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that its special discussion period with the group had ended. However, CK Hutchison is still talking with members of that group. They also plan to invite "important Chinese strategic investors" to join and become "key members" of the group. To get approval from all relevant official bodies, the group members and the deal's structure need to change. CK Hutchison will not make any deal until all relevant official bodies and departments approve it.</p>
