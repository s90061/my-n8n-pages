            <h1>French President: No Embassy in Palestine Before Israeli Hostages Are Released</h1>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview today that France plans to recognize Palestine as a state. However, France will not open an embassy there until the Islamist group Hamas releases the hostages it is holding in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Macron spoke about this on September 18 during an interview with CBS's "Face the Nation" program. The interview was broadcast today. He said, "For us, this will be a very clear and necessary condition before we open an embassy in Palestine."</p>
            <p>This news comes as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada have also recognized Palestine as a state. This joint action shows a big change in how Western countries deal with this issue. Portugal is also expected to recognize Palestine later today. France says it will do the same tomorrow at the United Nations, along with other countries.</p>
            <p>During the interview, Macron also strongly disagreed with plans to remove Palestinians from Gaza when the area is rebuilt. He stated, "If these reconstruction plans mean forcing them out, this is simply crazy." He added that for the international standing of the United States and France, "we should not be careless about such plans, whether we agree openly or quietly."</p>

            <h1>Trump: Lachlan, Ellison, Dell to Join TikTok Deal</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump announced today that Lachlan Murdoch, the CEO of Fox Corporation, Larry Ellison, who co-founded Oracle, and Michael Dell, the CEO of Dell Technologies, will be American investors in a deal. This deal will allow the popular short-video app TikTok to continue working in the United States.</p>
            <p>Trump mentioned that the United States and China have made progress in talks about TikTok. The deal would mean that TikTok's business in the U.S. must be moved from China's ByteDance company to American owners.</p>
            <p>Lachlan Murdoch recently got full control of his family's media companies, which include Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. This happened after a long legal fight within his family. Trump also said that Rupert Murdoch, a 94-year-old media owner, might also be part of this deal.</p>
            <p>Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle, is also a big supporter of the Republican Party. He has been connected to a possible TikTok deal before. Michael Dell is the head of Dell Technologies.</p>
            <p>In an interview on Fox News' "The Sunday Briefing" show, Trump praised these business leaders. He called them "American patriots" and "outstanding people." Trump said, "I think they will do very well." He also noted that TikTok helps him gain support from young voters for the 2024 presidential election.</p>
            <p>Under the previous President Biden's government, the U.S. Congress passed a law. This law said that ByteDance, the Chinese company, must sell TikTok's U.S. operations. If they did not, TikTok would be banned. TikTok has 170 million users in the U.S. Since Trump started his term, he has delayed the ban many times. He has also included talks about TikTok as part of larger economic discussions with China.</p>

            <h1>UK, Canada, Australia Recognize Palestinian State; Israel Will Expand West Bank Settlements</h1>
            <p>After the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia announced they would recognize Palestine as a state, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised today to make settlements bigger in the West Bank. The West Bank is land that Israel controls. Meanwhile, a Hamas official said this is a big success for the Palestinian people's rights.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said in a statement that for many years, even with a lot of pressure from inside and outside Israel, he stopped a "terrorist state" from being created. He explained, "We did this with strong will and good political thinking. Also, we have doubled the number of Jewish settlements in the Judea and Samaria Area, which is Israel's name for the West Bank. We will keep doing this."</p>
            <p>At the same time, Mahmud Mardawi, a senior official from Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group, spoke about the recognition of Palestine by the UK, Canada, and Australia. He told Agence France-Presse that "These steps show a win for Palestinian rights and that our cause is fair. It also sends a clear message: no matter how many bad things the occupiers do, our national rights can never be taken away."</p>
            <p>Earlier, Israel's Foreign Ministry said it rejected the "one-sided" recognition by the UK, Canada, and Australia. Israel warned that this action could make the region more unstable.</p>
            <p>These three countries are the first members of the G7 group (a group of seven rich countries) to recognize Palestine today. France and other countries are expected to do the same tomorrow during a big meeting at the United Nations in New York. The Israeli Foreign Ministry clearly stated, "Israel strongly rejects the unilateral announcement by the United Kingdom and some other countries to recognize a Palestinian state."</p>
