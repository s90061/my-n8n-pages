            <h1>Hengchun Ancient City West Gate will ban four-wheeled vehicles, residents hope road barriers will be redesigned</h1>
            <p>In Hengchun, Pingtung County, the West Gate of the old city has often been hit by vehicles recently. The Bureau of Cultural Heritage, Ministry of Culture, will put barriers on the road in front of the gate. This will stop four-wheeled vehicles from passing. This new rule might start in December. Last night, there was a meeting. Some people living nearby said the barriers do not look good with the old city. They hope for a new design.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Cultural Heritage said that the Hengchun West Gate is an old monument. It has a height limit of 2.1 meters. In the last five years, a vehicle has hit the gate and damaged it about once a year. So, in 2023, the Bureau started talking with local people about how to fix this problem. On the evening of October 14, the Bureau held another meeting at the Hengchun Jun Fude Temple Square. They announced the new plan for traffic safety at the West Gate and asked for people's ideas.</p>
            <p>The Bureau plans to put movable barriers on both sides of the West Gate. These barriers can be removed if needed. Normally, four-wheeled vehicles cannot pass, but motorcycles can still go through. Near the gate's entrance, there will be signs telling drivers to take a different road. Also, at the North Gate, where vehicles can currently pass, height limits will be put in place.</p>
            <p>The movable barriers are yellow with a red sign that says "no cars." Some residents said directly, "It's really ugly." They wondered why, after spending so much money on design, they would make something like this.</p>
            <p>Yan Shi-xiong, a researcher from the "Downwind Nature Interpretation Studio" who was at the meeting, also agreed that the barriers do not fit the style of the old city. He hopes that the group in charge will design them again. He also suggested that residents should vote for their favorite design. This voting process could also help to tell people about the ban on four-wheeled vehicles.</p>
            <p>Some residents said that shops near the West Gate are worried. They think stopping cars might hurt their business. Other residents suggested that the signs for changing roads should be clearer. Car drivers should understand quickly that they cannot go forward. They also said that Google Maps should mark this area as "no cars" so that people from other places do not get lost.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Cultural Heritage replied that people care about how it looks. So, they will discuss the design again. However, road signs must still follow traffic laws. The ban on four-wheeled vehicles at the West Gate will start in December at the earliest. The trial period has no set length. During this time, they will use existing movable barriers with signs. They will announce the plan one month before it starts.</p>
            <p>About the shops' worries, the Bureau said that the new roads might not be as easy to use as before. But the gate has been damaged many times recently. In the worst case, the National Property Administration asked for 1.7 million New Taiwan Dollars for damages. So, to choose the lesser of two evils, even though cars are not allowed, motorcycles and bicycles can still pass. If the trial period causes big problems for people's lives, they will talk about what to do next.</p>

            <h1>US stocks mostly down, some up; investment adviser says Taiwan stocks remain in a bull market</h1>
            <p>Jerome Powell, the head of the US central bank (Fed), hinted that they might stop reducing their money supply. He also warned that job growth in the US is slowing down. Because of this, most of the four main US stock indexes went down, while some went up a little. TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) fell by more than 2%, and Nvidia's stock dropped by over 4%. An investment advisor said that Taiwan's stock market went up sharply on October 14th but then fell. It ended below 26,800 points. However, the advisor believes the market is still in a "bull market," meaning it is expected to grow. People are now looking at TSMC's upcoming meeting for important information.</p>
            <p>Investors are currently thinking about two things: growing trade tensions between the US and China, and the latest talk from Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve. This caused the four main US stock indexes to mostly go down.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 202.88 points, or 0.44%. The S&P 500 index went down slightly by 10.41 points, or 0.16%. The Nasdaq index dropped by 172.91 points, or 0.76%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell by 153.14 points, or 2.28%.</p>
            <p>Chairman Powell suggested that the Federal Reserve might soon stop reducing its balance sheet (money supply). He did not give more information about future interest rates. He also warned that job growth in the United States is slowing down a lot.</p>
            <p>TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) went down by 2.29%, closing at 295.94 US dollars. Nvidia's stock dropped by more than 4%.</p>
            <p>On October 14th, the Taiwan stock index reached a high of 27,507.16 points during the day, which was a new record. After that, it fell and turned negative. It closed down by 130.27 points at 26,793.15 points, going below the 26,800-point mark. The total value of shares traded was 683.169 billion New Taiwan Dollars. The three major institutional investors all sold more shares than they bought, selling a total of 24.572 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of shares.</p>
            <p>On October 14th, US President Trump strongly criticized China for stopping its purchase of US soybeans. He called this an "act of economic hostility." He threatened that the US might take action in return, stopping business with China in cooking oil and other trade areas.</p>
            <p>Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, said in an interview with CNBC, an American finance news channel, that Trump might still add a 100% tax on goods from China entering the US. This could happen on November 1st or even earlier. It depends on what China does next in their disagreement about rare earth minerals.</p>
            <p>Investment advisors said that Taiwan's stock market went up sharply on October 14th, but then it fell with some ups and downs. People quickly sold shares to make a profit. However, they believe the Taiwan stock market is still in a growing phase. They will watch if US stocks start to rise again. If they do, Taiwan stocks are expected to follow and grow more. TSMC will hold an online meeting for investors on October 16th, which will be an important event for the market.</p>

            <h1>UK Climate Change Committee warns high-temperature crisis requires urgent action</h1>
            <p>Today, October 14, the UK Climate Change Committee gave a warning. They said that the UK needs to get ready earlier for global temperatures rising by at least 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050. This is because the government is not ready enough for the extreme weather that is already happening.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this summer was the hottest ever recorded in the UK. Very high temperatures harmed people's health, farming, and important structures like roads and bridges. Many areas even said they were in a drought, meaning there was not enough water.</p>
            <p>The UK Climate Change Committee wrote an open letter to the Environment Secretary, giving their advice. They stated, "It is clear that we are not prepared for these changes in weather and climate now. We are even less prepared for the problems we expect to see in the coming decades."</p>
            <p>The UK Climate Change Committee pointed out six important areas that need attention: public health, food safety, strong infrastructure, protecting cities and towns from disasters, keeping public services working, and making the economy grow in a way that can handle climate change.</p>
            <p>Most countries in the world promised in the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to keep the global temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, information from the United Nations and science groups in the European Union shows that global temperatures have already risen by 1.3 to 1.4 degrees. Scientists are surprised by how quickly this has happened.</p>
            <p>Julia King, who leads the Adaptation Committee of this organization, said in a press conference, "We still believe that keeping the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is a goal we can reach in the long term. But the chance of not reaching it is clearly getting higher."</p>
            <p>The organization also warned that we should not ignore the possibility that global temperatures could rise by 4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. When planning homes and important structures, the government should think about how they will handle the next 75 to 100 years.</p>
