            <h1>National Development Council: Taiwan's Startup Funding Reaches New High in 2024, Exceeding NT$100 Billion</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's National Development Council (NDC) announced good news today. In 2024, new companies in Taiwan received more than 100 billion New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) in funding. This is about 3.34 billion US dollars. This amount is the highest ever, even though it's a difficult time for investments around the world.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te wants to make Taiwan a great place for new businesses. He hopes that new companies will get 150 billion NTD in investments every year.</p>
            <p>The NDC held a press conference today to share their progress. Mr. Hsiao Chen-jung, who is in charge of industry development at the NDC, said that the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made digital businesses, like cloud services and online shopping, grow faster. This led to a lot of investment in new businesses globally in 2021. But then, investments went down worldwide. However, in Taiwan, funding for new businesses kept growing and reached new high levels. In 2024, it went over 100 billion NTD, which is about 107.2 billion NTD.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsiao Chen-jung explained that to reach the goal of 150 billion NTD, they need more money and also many good new companies to invest in. The government has three main plans: first, give more money for investments; second, encourage more people to start new businesses; and third, help train people to make their businesses more successful.</p>
            <p>To get more money and make investments grow, the National Development Fund is trying new methods. They are using ten "hundred-billion funds" to help different industries grow. They already have seven such funds and will create more for healthcare, sports, and military industries.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chan Fang-kuan, the Deputy Minister of the NDC, added that the National Development Fund is focusing on specific areas to keep investments active. They also started a "Startup Blooming Program" to find more new businesses and help them succeed.</p>
            <p>The NDC said that in the second half of 2025, they plan to start the "Startup Blooming Program." They will choose 100 good local and regional new business teams. The best 3 teams will get 10 million NTD each, 6 teams will get 6 million NTD each, and the other teams will receive 3 million NTD to help their businesses. In total, more than 300 million NTD will be given as rewards.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chan Fang-kuan said that the main goal is not just to give a lot of money. It is to give people who want to start a business the right training and ideas, so they have a better chance of success.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that the NDC will help new Taiwanese businesses connect with global partners and attract new international businesses to Taiwan. This will help big Taiwanese companies work with new international businesses and find new ways to grow.</p>

            <h1>Woman Suspected of Drunk Driving Stops Car on Highway 82, Causes 4 Injuries</h1>
            <p>On the night of August 14th, around 8 PM, there was a car accident on Highway 82 in Chiayi, Taiwan. Three cars crashed into each other, and four people were hurt. It seems a woman named Fan was driving after drinking alcohol. She stopped her car on the road, and two cars behind her crashed into it. After the accident, Ms. Fan left the scene. The police have sent her case to the court.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi County Police Bureau's Puzi Branch said today that Ms. Fan stopped her car on the road, possibly because it broke down. Then, she walked away from the accident scene. The police found her quickly for questioning. Her alcohol test showed 0.51 mg/L, which means she was driving drunk and left the accident scene. Her case has been sent to the Chiayi District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi County Fire Department said that last night they received a report about a car accident near the 11-kilometer mark on Highway 82. They immediately sent a team. When they arrived, they reported that three cars were involved. There were four injured people: one adult and three children. All of them were awake but felt pain in their bodies. They were taken to Puzi Hospital by ambulance for medical care.</p>

            <h1>Chen Yi-shen: "End of War" is Just "End of War," Criticism of "Pro-Japan" is Unnecessary and Unfair</h1>
            <p>Chen Yi-shen, the head of the National Archives, said today that some people, including China's Taiwan Affairs Office, say that using the term "end of war" means being too friendly to Japan. He thinks that attacking someone just by looking at the title of a speech shows the disagreements and political problems in society. But he believes it is "not necessary and not fair to us." He said that many people today use the term "end of war," which simply means the end of the war. It is a neutral phrase.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Chen Yi-shen spoke at the opening of the "Sino-Japanese War to Post-War Takeover Academic Conference" and a new book launch for "Chiang Kai-shek's Diaries (1937-1947)." He said that the three-day conference and a small exhibition called "Light and Shadow: Important Historical Records of Taiwan Before and After 1945" aim to help people understand and think about this important time in history more fully.</p>
            <p>He explained that publishing the diaries of Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, has been a planned task for the National Archives for the past two years. It is not really part of any special event. However, the diaries published this time, from 1937 to 1947, cover the eight years of the Sino-Japanese War and two years after the war. This matches the time period of the conference. So, having the book launch together with the conference works well and helps both events.</p>
            <p>He said that the Republic of China started fighting against Japan's invasion in September 1931 after the Mukden Incident. Then, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937, it began a full and long war against Japan. Chiang Kai-shek was the main leader. The situation only changed when the Pacific War began at the end of 1941, and China, the US, and Britain became allies. The allies finally won in 1945.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that some media, internet users, and even a spokesperson from China's Taiwan Affairs Office criticized the National Archives for using "end of war." They said it showed a pro-Japan attitude and avoided or changed history, instead of directly saying "victory in the Anti-Japanese War." He stated that such attacks, just looking at the title, show the divisions and political conflicts in society. "But I think it is unnecessary and unfair to us."</p>
            <p>He repeated that he often heard his father use phrases like "Japanese era" and "surrender" (Èôç‰ºè, k≈çfuku). At first, he thought his father was talking about "restoration" (ÂÖâÂæ©, guƒÅngf√π), which is what was taught in schools, because the Taiwanese pronunciation sounds similar (and the Japanese pronunciation is also similar). But "surrender" is from Japan's point of view, and "restoration" is from China's point of view. They are very different. This is because people had different life experiences, and we should respect that. He added that many people today use the term "end of war," which literally means the end of the war. It is a neutral term.</p>
            <p>He said that one reason the Japanese military leaders started the war against China was to "fight communism." But this actually made Chiang Kai-shek stop fighting the communists and work with them to "resist Japan." The Communist Party grew stronger during the eight-year war. After the war, they won the civil war against the Kuomintang with help from the Soviet Union (and successful political propaganda). This led to the creation of the People's Republic of China, a communist country.</p>
            <p>He stated that Japan's invasion of China led to the birth of a communist China, which is a big irony in history. On the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek led the full war against Japan, was invited to the Cairo Conference, and finally worked with the US, UK, and Soviet Union to defeat Japan. At the same time, he helped create the United Nations, and the Republic of China became one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. From China's historical view, these are important achievements that should not be forgotten.</p>
            <p>He emphasized that in Taiwan in 2025, when looking back at the big changes of 1945 (80 years ago), we can see things from different angles. The small exhibition "Light and Shadow: Important Historical Records of Taiwan Before and After 1945" aims to deal with this question. At that time, many smart people in Taiwan were happy because Japanese colonial rule ended and welcomed their "motherland." They accepted the idea of "restoration." However, the Republic of China government was not ready for modern rule. They took over roughly and governed poorly. Less than a year and a half later, the 228 Incident happened. The exhibition specifically chose examples and diaries of people like Lin Hsien-tang to show how the times changed.</p>
            <p>He said that in 1991, Stanford University published the first book about the 228 Incident. Its title was "A Tragic Beginning." This can be called the start of Taiwan's "Republic of China era," and later, after Taiwan became democratic, it was called the start of the "Republic of China (in) Taiwan."</p>
            <p>He explained that this beginning included the US helping the Republic of China army occupy Taiwan, based on promises made in the Cairo Declaration. It was like a "joint management" situation. This is why the US government did not get involved in the 228 Incident. It was not until the end of 1949, especially the beginning of 1950 when the Korean War started, that the US changed its position. They then made special arrangements for the status of Taiwan and Penghu through the San Francisco Peace Treaty.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-shen said that this "Important Historical Records Micro-Exhibition" just wants to show how complex Taiwan was in 1945, to avoid only telling one side of the story. It is not trying to give all the answers to all problems.</p>
