            <h1>After 20 Months, Prince Harry of UK Drinks Tea with His Father, King Charles III</h1>
            <p>Today, Prince Harry of the UK had afternoon tea with his father, King Charles III. This was the first time the father and son met in 20 months. It might be the first step to fix their problems.</p>
            <p>Harry last saw his father in February 2024. At that time, King Charles III had just announced he had cancer and started treatment.</p>
            <p>Buckingham Palace said that Charles, who is 76 years old, had afternoon tea with his son today at Clarence House in London.</p>
            <p>Harry, who is 40 years old, arrived in the UK on September 8th. He plans to attend several events.</p>
            <p>Harry and his American wife, Meghan, moved to live in California, USA, in 2020. After that, Harry often spoke badly about the British Royal Family and its rules in interviews, documentaries, and his own book. Many of his strong comments were about his father Charles and his brother, Prince William, who is next in line to the throne. Because of this, his relationship with his family completely broke.</p>
