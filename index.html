        const text = `**The Rise of Quiet Quitting: Are Employees Just Doing Their Jobs?**

The term "quiet quitting" has become a hot topic, particularly on social media. It describes employees who are no longer going above and beyond in their jobs. Instead, they're fulfilling their job descriptions and nothing more. This doesn't mean they're slacking off or not doing their work; it simply means they're setting boundaries and prioritizing work-life balance.

Some see quiet quitting as a sign of disengagement and a lack of motivation in the workplace. They argue that it can negatively impact productivity and innovation. Others view it as a healthy response to burnout and overwork, a way for employees to protect their mental health and prevent exhaustion. They feel that doing the bare minimum is acceptable if they are not compensated for extra time and effort.

The phenomenon raises questions about the nature of work itself. Are employers expecting too much from their employees? Should employees be rewarded for going the extra mile? Or is it simply a matter of employees reclaiming their time and energy? The debate continues, with both sides presenting valid arguments. What is certain is that quiet quitting highlights the evolving relationship between employees and employers in the modern workplace.

**New AI Tool Aims to Personalize Education for Every Student**

A new artificial intelligence (AI) tool promises to revolutionize education by creating personalized learning experiences for each student. Developed by a team of researchers and educators, the tool analyzes student performance data to identify individual learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses. Based on this analysis, it generates customized lesson plans and learning activities tailored to each student's specific needs.

The AI tool can adapt to a student's pace of learning, providing extra support when needed and accelerating the learning process for those who are ready. It also offers real-time feedback and guidance, helping students to stay engaged and motivated. The developers believe that this personalized approach can help students achieve their full potential.

While the AI tool is still in its early stages of development, it has already shown promising results in pilot programs. Teachers report that students are more engaged and that their learning outcomes have improved. The developers hope to make the tool available to schools across the country in the near future, potentially transforming the way education is delivered.
