            <h1>Li Lih-Ren: I Drove a Taxi for a Year After Starting My Acting Career, Always Keep a Sense of Danger</h1>
            <p>Actor Li Lih-Ren plays a role in the TV show "Bye Bye Weekend" where he meets his first love again and fails in business. This story is very real. He shared that he drove a taxi for one year before and after starting his acting career. He also had times when he had no acting jobs. He said, "For these 20 years, I have always made myself feel a sense of danger."</p>
            <p>Li Lih-Ren has given different and excellent performances in movies and TV shows. In "Bye Bye Weekend," he meets his first love again, and the story of failing in business made him feel strong emotions. Recently, he was interviewed by CNA. Li Lih-Ren said that before and after starting his acting career, he also worked as a taxi driver for one year. "Because I had to go to class during the day, I couldn't work. I also had to take care of my mother, so I drove a taxi at night." At that time, Li Lih-Ren only thought about making money and taking care of his mother.</p>
            <p>Li Lih-Ren has been acting for almost 30 years. He said that he still feels a sense of danger even now. "I feel it's not enough, like I can be even better, whether it's work success or money earned, I still want to achieve more."</p>
            <p>Now, Li Lih-Ren does not put money first. When he chooses a job, he thinks about the script and if he can play the character well. These are important things Li Lih-Ren considers when taking a job. "I think the prices for acting now are not like before. If you can enjoy the feeling of achievement from acting, then you will be happier."</p>
            <p>During the interview, Li Lih-Ren suddenly asked, "What is a good actor?" For Li Lih-Ren, anyone who has been married for more than 10 years is a good actor. "Why do I say this? How hard is it to keep a marriage going? If these 10 years are good, how many times did you 'act' in between?" Li Lih-Ren's meaning of "act" is not to lie to the other person, but your true effort. "In life, you must 'act' for your husband's parents. I also have to 'act' for my own parents, and for her relatives. So, anyone married for more than 10 years will be a good actor."</p>
            <p>Speaking of his family, Li Lih-Ren and Tao Ching-Ying have been married for many years and have two children. Their family life is happy and has no secrets. He even asked his children about "coming out." Li Lih-Ren said, "I think no matter if you like different genders or the same gender, children want their family to support them in everything they do. You need to tell me so I know how to support you." He has an open and honest approach to raising his children.</p>
            <p>Li Lih-Ren also shared that he and Tao Ching-Ying openly talked about their first loves. He admitted that he did not know how to be in love before and always had regrets about his first love. A few years after they broke up, Li Lih-Ren went back to find his first love, not for anything else, but just to know if she was doing well. "It was like seeing an old friend, truly just that. After living through those young years, I felt very sorry towards her."</p>

            <h1>US Tariffs on Cambodia Drop to 19%; Hun Manet Calls It the Best News</h1>
            <p>Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet today welcomed the 19% trade tariff announced by US President Trump. He said that the tax rate dropping from 36% to 19% is "good news" for Cambodia.</p>
            <p>According to reports from Associated Press and Agence France-Presse, Hun Manet wrote on social media that Trump not only helped stop the fighting between Cambodian and Thai armies after nearly a week of conflict but also helped Cambodia's economy by lowering tariffs.</p>
            <p>Hun Manet said on Facebook: "This is the best news for the Cambodian people and economy, allowing Cambodia to continue its economic growth."</p>
            <p>In early April, Donald Trump had warned many trade partners that he would set equal tariffs. He wanted to change global trade to benefit the US. He threatened to put a 49% equal tariff on Cambodia, but this rate was lowered to 36% in July.</p>
            <p>On July 31, Eastern Time, Trump approved high equal tariffs for many countries. These new rules will start in the next week.</p>
            <p>Cambodia is a main place where Western brands make cheap clothes. In 2024, Cambodia exported about 10 billion US dollars worth of goods to the US, mostly clothing. Many factories in Cambodia are owned by Chinese companies. The White House has accused Cambodia of letting Chinese goods pass through to the US market, which helps these goods avoid higher US tariffs on China.</p>

            <h1>Machine Tool and Machinery Associations: We Hope the Government Continues to Get the Best Deal from the US</h1>
            <p>The United States announced that the temporary tariff rate for Taiwan will be 20%. The Machinery Association said this morning that this will have a bigger impact on the machinery industry than expected. The association suggested that the government should continue to talk with the US at a national level to get a tariff rate similar to what competing countries have. They also suggested controlling the exchange rate to protect their business and keep it competitive around the world.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Machine Tool & Accessory Builders' Association (TMBA) also released a statement at noon. They said that the old tariff rate for machine tools from Taiwan to the US was about 2% to 5%, and for parts, it was about 8%. The association thanked the government for actively helping the industry with tariff talks. However, the temporary result is still higher compared to the 15% tariff for competing countries like Japan and South Korea. They hope the government team will work hard and quickly finish talks with the US through diplomatic ways to get the best benefits for Taiwan's industry.</p>
            <p>The White House announced that the temporary tariff rate for Taiwan will be 20%. President Lai Ching-te said today that the US first announced a 20% "temporary tariff" for Taiwan. If an agreement is made later, the tariff rate could be lowered again.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry released a statement this morning. It said that compared to the 15% tariff for competing countries like Japan and South Korea, the 20% US tariff on Taiwan will seriously hurt the machinery industry. It will also continue to affect Taiwan's ability to sell machinery internationally.</p>
            <p>The Machinery Association pointed out that recently, companies have been hurt because Taiwan's currency is stronger than competing countries' currencies. This has made it harder to get international orders and has directly cut into companies' profits. The association said that after the tariffs are announced, it might cause international supply chains to move. This could lead to small and medium-sized supply chains in Taiwan shrinking and breaking.</p>
            <p>The Machinery Association suggested that the government should continue to talk and negotiate with the US at a national level. They should try to get a tariff rate similar to that of competitor countries. They also suggested using exchange rate control to help the machinery industry stay competitive worldwide and continue to keep their businesses in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Regarding tariffs, the Machinery Association said that the machinery industry has been concerned for a long time about the different tariffs between Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. The newest results show that Taiwan's tariffs are still 5% higher than Japan and South Korea. This affects the machinery industry more than expected. They asked the government to continue talking and negotiating with the US. They hope to lower the tariffs on Taiwan. If they cannot be lower than Japan and South Korea, at least they hope they can be the same.</p>
            <p>Regarding the exchange rate, the Machinery Association said that the exchange rate is still key to the machinery industry's ability to compete in exports. Based on data from 2021 until July 31 of this year, the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) has only fallen by 4.6%. The Japanese Yen has fallen sharply by 46.2%, and the Korean Won has also fallen by 28%. In the past, Taiwan's equipment prices were 20% to 30% lower than Japan's, but this price difference has completely disappeared. This has severely hurt Taiwan's machinery equipment exports, especially for companies that stay in Taiwan and focus on selling abroad. It is also a main reason why orders have decreased.</p>
            <p>The Machinery Association also stated that the machinery industry has been severely affected recently. They especially need financial and policy support from the government. They asked the government to plan special loan programs (not just the original credit guarantees, but extra funds) to help companies with cash flow.</p>
            <p>The Machinery Association also asked banks not to stop lending when times are hard. They suggested that banks should consider extending loan periods and allowing delayed payments to reduce the pressure on companies' finances. In addition, they suggested that the government should increase domestic demand and help local manufacturing industries improve. They want the government to encourage local manufacturers to replace old equipment with new, Taiwan-made equipment. They also want the government to provide full subsidies for these purchases. This would not only help manufacturing industries improve but also help keep Taiwan's machinery industry and its related supply chains alive.</p>
