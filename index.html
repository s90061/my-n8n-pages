            <h1>Russia Says Poland's Claim of Drone Entry Is "Nothing New," Denies It</h1>
            <p>Moscow, September 11 â€“ Today, the Kremlin said that statements from Warsaw and other European countries about Poland shooting down a Russian drone are "nothing new." They denied these claims and stated that Moscow would not say anything more about the situation.</p>

            <p>Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said that Moscow would not make new comments about the situation. He explained that the Russian Ministry of Defense had already given a statement about it.</p>
            <p>Peskov told reporters, "There will be no new comments. Our Ministry of Defense has already commented on this and said that we can offer discussions if needed. There is nothing more to add."</p>
            <p>He added, "As for what we hear and read from Warsaw, there is really nothing new in it. Such statements have recently become common in almost all European capital cities. We see that this continues."</p>

            <h1>Keelung Father Accused of Smothering Son with Pillow, Court Keeps Him in Jail</h1>
            <p>Keelung, September 11 â€“ A man named Jian from Keelung is believed to have used a pillow to kill his 5-year-old son on May 14 this year. This happened after he argued with his wife. He was arrested and put in jail after the event. Prosecutors have now charged him with murder, and today his case was sent to the court again. The Keelung District Court said that Mr. Jian might try to escape, so they decided to keep him in jail.</p>
            <p>Police found that Mr. Jian and his wife, Ms. Zhang, had a 5-year-old son together. The couple often argued about daily life issues. They separated in April this year. They agreed that their son would live with Ms. Jian's parents. Mr. Jian was allowed to pick up his son from school and have him stay at his home, with Ms. Jian's permission.</p>
            <p>On the evening of May 14, Ms. Jian went to Mr. Jian's home to pick up their son. When she entered the room, she found Mr. Jian was not there. She was shocked to see her son lying on the bed, not breathing. She called for help, and he was taken to the hospital, but he could not be saved.</p>
            <p>The police were informed and arrested Mr. Jian the next day. Mr. Jian admitted that he had killed his own son.</p>
            <p>The Keelung District Court said tonight that after the judge questioned him, Mr. Jian admitted to the actions described in the indictment. The court believes he committed murder against a child, which is a crime under the Children and Youth Welfare and Rights Protection Act and the Criminal Code. Also, because he might try to escape, the court decided to keep him in jail according to the rules of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>
