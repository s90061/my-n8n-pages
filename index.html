            <h1>Recall Vote Nears: Green Party Says It's About Democracy, Blue-White Parties Call to Vote Against Recall</h1>
            <p>The day for the recall vote is coming soon. In Taipei, the election is very active. The Green Party (DPP) members in the Parliament and the Blue Party (KMT) members in the Taipei City Council met close to each other today. The Green Party said this vote is a fight between democracy and being against democracy. The Blue-White parties asked people to vote against the recall on July 26, even if there is bad weather.</p>
            <p>The recall vote is now 72 hours away. This morning, on July 26, members of the Green Party from the Parliament, called "51 Team," stood in Taipei. They were at Nanjing East Road, Bade Road, and Guangfu North Road. Lawmakers like Wu Pei-yi and Wu Szu-yao, along with many Green Party city council members, greeted people. They asked everyone to vote "yes" for the recall on July 26.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said that Taipei is very important. She said that lawmakers Wang Hung-wei and Hsu Chiao-hsin from the Blue Party are "the worst of the worst." The "51 Team" will stay with the citizens until the very end to protect democracy in the Parliament. She said they will make sure the Parliament works normally again, follows democratic rules, and speaks for the people. She called it a fight between democracy and being against democracy.</p>
            <p>Reporters at the scene asked about a plan to "reject China's wrong idea about UN General Assembly Resolution 2758." This plan has not been discussed for 10 months. Wu Szu-yao said that Resolution 2758 helps Taiwan's power in the world. Many countries are now making decisions to fix this. But only Taiwan's Parliament does not support its own country. She said the Blue-White parties even walked out. She said it's like "talking to the air."</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao also said that when Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim went to the Czech Republic, China caused problems for her. The Green Party tried to pass a statement in the Parliament to speak against this, but the Blue-White parties stopped it. She said that if they need to say "no" to China, "the Blue-White parties become afraid." She hopes that new public opinion will create a new Parliament.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Blue Party in the Taipei City Council was asking for votes at the Taipei Arena crossing. They asked people to "go out on July 26 and vote NO to the recall." Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an, Council Speaker Dai Hsin-chin, and many Blue Party city council members were there to show support.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an spoke to reporters. He said that today, the Speaker asked all members of the Blue Party in the council to stand at the crossroads. They want to ask all voters to come out on July 26 and vote "no" to the recall.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked about campaign materials with pictures of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo that said "Yes to Recall." They also asked if he would take time off from work to help with the campaign, like Taichung Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen did. Chiang Wan-an only said that in these last days, he asks all citizens again to come out and vote "no" to the recall. He said he would help with the campaign according to the rules. He still has some city work, but most of his campaign work will be in the evening. He will work with the lawmakers' plans and take leave according to the rules.</p>
            <p>Because a typhoon might affect July 26, Chiang Wan-an smiled and said, "No matter what, rain or shine, vote against the recall." He believes every area is important to protect. He said Taipei will get everyone to work together, rain or shine, to vote "no" to the recall.</p>
            <p>Reporters then asked about Wu Szu-yao's statement that the Blue-White parties hide when they need to say "no" to China. Hsu Chiao-hsin replied that it is always the Green Party that has spies. She said the Blue Party is the one that finds out about spy cases and makes national security safer. She asked the Green Party to stop hiding things. She said the Secretary-General of the National Security Council, Wu Chao-hsieh, has not dared to be questioned by the Parliament. He only uses other things to hide. She asked him to come and face this.</p>
            <p>Regarding rumors that heads of villages in Songshan District are traveling abroad and not supporting the campaign, Wang Hung-wei also said that all village heads and supporters will come out on July 26 to vote against the recall. She said that what people care most about now is the tariffs with the United States. She thinks that even though tariffs for Japan are lower, Japan has to allow rice and trucks to come in. But for Taiwan, everything is still a secret. She asked the government to quickly explain what impact this will have on industries.</p>
            <p>Dai Hsin-chin explained that with the vote coming soon, the Blue Party in the council has asked all its members to support. They support Mayor Chiang's team and the five Blue Party lawmakers from Taipei. These lawmakers are very important for building Taipei and getting money from the central government. He also said that many heads of villages from Songshan District came out today, but they had planned their trips abroad a long time ago. He said it is not true that they do not support voting against the recall, as some bad rumors say.</p>
