            <h1>China's September 3rd Military Parade: Experts Say False History Is Used to Control World Affairs</h1>
            <p>Today, the Chinese Asia-Pacific Elite Exchange Association held a meeting about "The Possible Plans and Impact of China's 'September 3rd Military Parade'." People at the meeting said that by holding the "September 3rd Military Parade" and using a wrong story about the war, Beijing wants to show it wants to control world affairs strongly. Its incorrect "One China Principle" and ideas about Taiwan's status do not match the truth. These ideas have no real reason or legal basis.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) tonight, MAC Deputy Minister Shen Yu-chung, who attended the meeting, said that this year marks 80 years since World War II ended. He noted that the countries that were on the side of the "Axis" in the war are now democracies. This shows that only freedom and democracy can help countries grow. Only respecting human dignity earns respect. Control and attacking others only bring death, sadness, and more unfairness.</p>
            <p>He said that in recent years, China has put pressure on Taiwan and nearby countries. They use military threats and other types of harassment. This makes the international community very unstable. China is increasing its military power, saying it is for "the great renewal of the nation." This is an example of a new strong-rule system that threatens freedom and democracy. It is like the military governments 80 years ago that used nationalism to start wars. So, it is very ironic that China now talks about remembering the "fight against fascism."</p>
            <p>Shen Yu-chung emphasized that China is changing history. It says it led the war against Japan and then holds events like "September 3rd" and "Taiwan Retrocession Day." These events have no political, historical, or legal basis. In history, China did not do anything helpful in the war; it only used the war to get stronger. Politically, after the war, the world's values were against attacking others and for building democracy and human rights.</p>
            <p>He said that what China is doing now â€“ standing with attackers and harming democracy and human rights â€“ is known around the world. Legally, China purposely promotes the "One China Principle" globally. It wrongly connects this to UN Resolution 2758. It also makes legal mistakes with its idea of "state succession." All these are attempts to create an "international one China."</p>
            <p>Shen Yu-chung stated that China uses the big military parade and a false historical story to make the international community accept its one-sided claims over Taiwan's sovereignty. China wants to link the political goals of "international one China" (which means supporting unification and stopping outside help for Taiwan) with "Cross-Strait one China" (which means stopping independence and encouraging closer ties). This is to push its plan for "forced unification" with Taiwan later. Many democratic countries have already said they are against this, and the people of Taiwan will not agree with it either.</p>
            <p>He also pointed out that China spends a lot of money on the military parade. This is to show its military strength and get more power in the region and the world. It also stands with controlling governments like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. It wants to create a world where it can stand against democratic countries like the US and Europe. At the same time, China hopes to use the "September 3rd Military Parade" to encourage nationalism. This is to make people in China feel more confident and to take attention away from problems inside and outside the country, such as competition with the US, a weaker economy, corruption in the military, and power struggles.</p>
            <p>Scholars at the meeting also said that China's "September 3rd Military Parade" has a clear goal to influence Taiwan. In May this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote an article in Russian media. He linked China's plans for Taiwan to the world order after World War II. He hoped to make China's claims over Taiwan seem right, both historically and legally.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that China will not stop these efforts after the "September 3rd Military Parade." China is not only trying to influence Taiwan and control the story of history. It also purposely combines the "Shanghai Cooperation Organization" summit with the "September 3rd Military Parade." This is to make the group of foreign leaders attending the parade look bigger.</p>
            <p>In addition, scholars also pointed out that Beijing uses legal arguments, historical memory, and military events. It not only falsely claims that China was the main force in the war against Japan. It also wants to make the "One China" idea seem more politically correct. It uses influence tactics to control historical stories. Scholars also emphasized that nationalism and love for the country are two sides of the same coin. China continues to use nationalism to make Xi Jinping's power stronger.</p>
            <p>The MAC also stressed that remembering the victory in the war is to show how important "peace" is. However, China keeps saying it will not stop using force against Taiwan and continues to increase its authoritarian power. This will affect the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. The government is carefully watching the situation. It also asks the people of Taiwan to unite and follow the government's policies for cross-strait exchanges. This is to protect the country's independence and respect.</p>
