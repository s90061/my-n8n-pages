<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%BD%A2%E8%B1%A1%E5%B1%95-%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E8%88%87%E9%A6%AC%E4%BE%86%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9Eai%E5%90%88%E4%BD%9C-213000941.html">News Link</a>

The Bureau of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) are holding the Taiwan Expo in Malaysia this month at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC). This is the eighth time the exhibition has been held, and it is the largest in history, focusing on AI-driven smart manufacturing and applications. TAITRA stated that Taiwan has strong capabilities in semiconductors, information and communication technology, smart manufacturing, and system integration. Malaysia, on the other hand, aims to become Southeast Asia's largest data center and is accelerating its digital infrastructure development. The two countries are expected to establish a broader cooperative and complementary relationship.

Malaysia aims to become Southeast Asia's largest data center, with both sides complementing each other.

TAITRA Secretary-General Wang Hsi-meng said that this year's expo focuses on five major themes: smart manufacturing, the big health industry, green sustainability, smart living, and tourism and culture. He specifically highlighted the potential for deeper cooperation between Taiwan and Malaysia in smart manufacturing, stating that by combining their expertise, both sides can upgrade smart systems and jointly achieve their digital vision.

TAITRA added that Malaysia is seeking to become Southeast Asia's largest data center, and in recent years has actively set up data centers and promoted 5G digital infrastructure. This has led to strong demand for high-performance computing, data analytics, and smart applications. Taiwan, in turn, produces over 90% of advanced AI chips, providing a crucial hardware foundation for global AI innovation. To meet Malaysia's AI needs, this year's expo also highlights AI, and for the first time, features an "AI Innovation Application Zone" to showcase the latest technologies in Taiwan's AI ecosystem.

TAITRA noted that Malaysia has designated the health industry as one of its key national development areas. The post-pandemic era has further highlighted the importance of digital health solutions and remote care. This year's health industry pavilion also demonstrates Taiwan's innovation and integrated applications in fields such as preventive medicine and precision diagnostics.

Regarding green sustainability, Wang Hsi-meng stated that Malaysia has ambitious environmental policy goals, and Taiwan can offer practical solutions to improve energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies, helping factories move towards a more sustainable and competitive future.

**China says Taiwan president spreading 'heresy' with sovereignty speech**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy", hostility, and provocation, after a speech in which he said the island is "of course" a country and that historical evidence and legal proof support this claim.

Beijing states that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have offered talks with China multiple times, but these offers have been rejected. China refers to Lai as a "separatist".

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had intentionally twisted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that blatantly incited cross-strait confrontation, and a hodgepodge of 'Taiwan independence' fallacies and heresies full of errors and omissions," it said in a statement.

"The fallacies fabricated by Lai Ching-te in contravention of history, reality, and jurisprudence will only be swept into the rubbish heap of history."

In response, Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said Lai was simply stating historical facts, and Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis".

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to face up to the fact that the Republic of China objectively exists and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.

Lai has repeatedly said that only Taiwan's people can decide their future, and that, as the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Taiwan has over the past five years faced increased military and political pressure from China, including war games.

**Hanguang and Urban Resilience Exercises to Combine in July; Defense Official: Boosting Public Awareness of National Defense for Protracted War**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E9%9F%93%E5%9C%8B%E7%91%9C%E7%8D%B2%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%A4%A7%E9%87%8F%E8%BE%B2%E7%94%A2%E8%A8%82%E5%96%AE%E6%98%AF-%E7%B6%93%E6%BF%9F%E7%B5%B1%E6%88%B0-%E8%98%87%E8%B2%9E%E6%98%8C-%E7%B8%BD%E9%AB%94%E7%9C%8B%E8%B5%B7%E4%BE%86%E5%B1%85%E5%BF%83%E5%B8%BD%E6%B8%AC-032831891.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan will combine two major exercises in July: the Hanguang exercise and the urban resilience exercise. Simply put, given the dangerous military situation in Taiwan, if the military is busy fighting and unable to respond, civilians must "save their own homes" in the event of major disasters. National security officials stated that in July, they hope to make the public aware that defense resilience is not just the military's responsibility; every civilian partner, especially those in non-military sectors, must be mobilized.

National security officials explained that this year, by combining the Hanguang and urban resilience exercises, they will link the military's response to enemy forces with the non-military sector's ability to react to emergencies. Therefore, July has been designated as "National Unity Month," with the theme "Team Taiwan, Stronger Together."

High-ranking officials from the Ministry of Interior stated that this year, residents in nine districtsâ€”Zhongzheng, Zhongshan, and Songshan in Taipei; Shalu, Qingshui, and Wuqi in Taichung; and West Central, East, and Shanhua in Tainanâ€”will participate in full evacuation drills. Civil defense brigades, village chiefs, volunteer police, traffic police, and firefighters, as well as apartment building management committees, will help guide residents to shelters. The Ministry of Interior will require all shelters in these nine districts, if they are non-sensitive areas, to open their gates so people can enter. Ministry of Interior officials mentioned that recently, after this news was released, many people checked shelters late at night and found the doors closed, which they then reported online.

Additionally, the government will release a new version of the "Air Raid Shelter Guide" and launch apps from the National Police Agency and National Fire Agency. These two disaster prevention apps will provide citizens with guides for various extreme conditions, such as typhoons, earthquakes, and natural disasters, and will also show the nearest air raid shelters and disaster shelters to their current location.

Europe is also preparing; Ministry of National Defense warns there's no longer "peace" or "war."

National security officials said that Germany plans to accelerate the expansion of anti-riot bunkers and air raid shelters starting in July 2025. In January 2025, Poland's civil defense and population protection act took effect, requiring buildings to include air raid shelters. In April 2025, Sweden announced a 100 million kronor investment to renovate 64,000 civil defense shelters nationwide and upgrade their air filtration systems, allowing these facilities to accommodate over two-thirds of Sweden's population, about 7 million people. In April 2025, Finland's Ministry of Interior stated it would begin updating various air raid shelters to provide 72 hours of accommodation. In May 2025, Estonia's Ministry of Interior also proposed strengthening air raid shelters, hoping to improve the air defense capabilities of all 270 public shelters nationwide.

National security officials stated that these examples show that Taiwan is not alone in its preparations; countries worldwide are responding to extreme geopolitical risks. Besides the air raid shelter guide, national security officials pointed out that in September 2025, Taiwan will also release a new "National Security Guide" for citizens, which is essentially a "National Defense Handbook."

The Hanguang exercise will be combined with the urban defense resilience exercise this year. Ministry of National Defense officials stated that since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war and the escalation of conflicts between Israel and Palestine, it has become clear that modern warfare does not distinguish between peacetime and wartime, or between enemy front and rear. The war trajectory can be "immediate."

Ministry of National Defense officials said that everyone initially thought the Russia-Ukraine war would only last 3 days, or at most a week, but it has now been over 3 years, and Ukraine is still fighting. This experience shows that any country could face a protracted war involving homeland defense and urban combat. Urban warfare relies on the resilience of continuous societal operation. As long as the people of Ukraine can continue to function, national combat power will prevent the enemy from invading due to the unity of the people. This is the ultimate goal of this Hanguang exercise: to raise awareness of national defense among all citizens, regardless of whether it is peacetime or wartime.
