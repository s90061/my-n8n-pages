Taiwan's weather agency says a typhoon is bringing strong, short rains. Today, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and the mountains of Taipei will have heavy rain or very heavy rain. Areas north of Taichung, and in the central and Taitung mountains, might also have heavy rain.

Please be careful of lightning and strong winds. In the mountains, watch out for landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides. In low areas, be careful of flooding.

**Typhoon Danas Causes Problems on 3 Main Roads**

Typhoon Danas has caused issues on three main roads, according to the highway agency. These problems include fallen trees in Gukeng, Yunlin, and mudslides and a fallen power pole in Zhongpu and Dapu, Chiayi. These roads are expected to open later today.

The typhoon's center was about 130 kilometers north of Taipei. The weather agency has now lifted the land warning for the typhoon. Another road in Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, was washed away and is expected to open tomorrow afternoon.

The highway agency will continue to check the typhoon and tell people about road conditions. They ask drivers to avoid mountain roads after heavy rain, as conditions can be dangerous.

**Taipei Starts "Health Agents" Program to Find Early Cancer Signs**

Taipei City's Health Department announced today a new program to find early signs of cancer. Finding these signs early can help stop cancer from developing. The city is holding an event to encourage people to get screened. Residents of Taipei who are eligible for screenings for colon cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, or oral cancer can get a scratch card with prizes if they get screened by the end of October.

The Health Department and the Taiwan Cancer Foundation started the "Health Agent Action" event, which runs from July to the end of October. Cancer has been the top cause of death in Taipei for over 50 years and is now affecting younger people more. In 2024, Taipei offered over 520,000 cancer screenings, finding over 6,000 cases of early cancer changes.

People can check the official website to see if they can join. For example, women in Taipei born between 1955 and 1980 who have not had a mammogram since 2024 can join the breast cancer screening part of the event. If you get screened for any of the four cancers at a special hospital, you can get a scratch card. The more screenings you get, the more chances to win prizes like SPA vouchers and gift cards.

If you don't win any prizes by the end of October, you can still join a special "hidden treasure" event in November. You could win a trip for two to Seoul with a hotel stay.
