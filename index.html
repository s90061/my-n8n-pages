https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68551469

Food prices in the UK are still getting more expensive, but the speed at which they are rising has slowed down. This small change is a positive sign for people doing their weekly shopping.

However, despite this slowdown, food costs have gone up significantly over the past two years. Many households are still finding it challenging to afford their usual groceries.

Some food items, such as sugar and olive oil, are still increasing in price quite quickly. This means that while overall food inflation is easing, certain products continue to become more expensive for consumers.

Supermarkets are working hard to manage these rising costs and offer good value. As a result, many shoppers have changed their habits, often choosing cheaper brands or buying less of certain items like meat to save money.

**Hybrid Work Is Growing, But Not Always Advertised**
https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/more-uk-employers-offering-hybrid-work-less-than-1-10-job-ads-mention-it-report-2024-04-08/

A new report shows that more employers in the UK are now offering hybrid work arrangements. This means that staff can work some days in the office and other days from home.

However, even though more companies offer this flexibility, very few job advertisements actually mention it. Less than one in ten job postings openly state that hybrid work is an option.

The report was created by the jobs platform Adzuna and the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. It found that hybrid working is most common in London and the South East of England.

Experts believe that hybrid work can help employees be more productive and can improve their mental well-being. It also helps companies attract good talent. However, this way of working is less common in sectors like retail, construction, and manufacturing.

**Europe Expects Record Number of Tourists in 2024**
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/europe-tourism-record-2024-predictions/index.html

Europe is preparing for a huge number of visitors in 2024. Experts believe that this year will break all previous records for tourism on the continent.

This increase follows a very strong recovery in travel after the pandemic. Many people, especially from the United States and countries in Asia, are very keen to visit European destinations.

While a boom in tourism is good for the economy, it also brings concerns about "overtourism." Popular cities like Venice and Amsterdam are already very crowded, and an even larger number of visitors could make these problems worse.

Because of this, some places are trying to manage the number of tourists they receive to protect local life and the environment. Despite these challenges, Europe continues to be one of the most popular places in the world to travel.`;
