            <h1>Taiwan and Czech Republic Talk About Economy and Technology; Czech Republic Will Help Taiwanese Companies with Electricity Problems</h1>
            <p>The 8th meeting between Taiwan and the Czech Republic about economy and technology has finished. During discussions about investing, Taiwanese companies in the Czech Republic said there was not enough electricity. The Czech side said they would actively help solve this. Also, in March this year, the Czech Republic added Taiwan to a list of countries whose citizens do not need a work visa. This shows they care about Taiwanese companies investing there.</p>
            <p>On September 15, Taiwan's Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Chiang Wen-juo, and David MÃ¼ller, the Director-General for EU and Foreign Trade at the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade, led the 8th Taiwan-Czech Economic and Technical Consultation Meeting. They talked about how the global economy is doing. They also discussed promoting trade, investing, working together in industries, and keeping the economy safe.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wen-juo said that even though global trade and the economy have been very unsure in recent years, international groups that predict the economy still think Taiwan's economy will grow in 2025. She also mentioned three big challenges: changes in global politics, the US putting taxes on goods from other countries, and limits on important materials and technology. The government has talked a lot with businesses and offered help. Taiwan is also working with democratic partners like the Czech Republic to build strong and helpful relationships by promoting "five key industries" and "trusted supply chains."</p>
            <p>Mr. MÃ¼ller said that the world situation keeps changing. Because of the US's trade policies, the Czech Republic is working closely with countries like Taiwan that have similar ideas. This helps them trade more and makes their industries more competitive in the world.</p>
            <p>The Trade Administration said that during the meeting, both sides discussed trade. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs explained how they are making the exhibition industry more digital and reducing its carbon footprint. The Czech side was very impressed with Taiwan's methods. They hope to learn from Taiwan to get more Czech companies to join exhibitions in Taiwan, which will help both countries trade more.</p>
            <p>Regarding investments, the Trade Administration said that Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs told the Czech side that the Taiwan Trade and Investment Office in Prague has officially opened. This office can work with the Czech Republic to help Taiwanese businesses that need it. Also, regarding the investment problems that Taiwanese businesses in the Czech Republic reported, such as not enough electricity, the Czech side said they would actively help solve them. They also mentioned that in March this year, Taiwan was added to the list of countries whose citizens do not need a work visa. This shows they care about Taiwanese companies investing.</p>
            <p>For cooperation in industries, the Trade Administration said that both sides agreed to continue working together on semiconductors through the "Taiwan-Czech Resilience Program." They also agreed that artificial intelligence is very important in the global technology supply chain. They will share more information and ideas about policies to make their industries more competitive. Both sides will also keep sending groups of smart city companies to visit each other and share new solutions.</p>
            <p>About economic safety and important minerals, both sides were happy to share ways to recycle important minerals in special meetings. As global trade changes, both sides hope to keep working together to build a helpful and fair economic relationship.</p>
            <p>According to statistics from Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, in 2024, the Czech Republic was Taiwan's biggest trading partner in Central and Eastern Europe. The trade between them was 2.37 billion US dollars, which is a 94.79% increase from the year before. For investments, by the end of July 2025, most Taiwanese investments in the Czech Republic were in information and communication technology. The total investment was 220 million US dollars. Currently, Taiwan is the 9th biggest investor among all EU countries.</p>

            <h1>Thai Police Use Tear Gas on Protesters from Cambodia; Argument Over Border Starts New Fight</h1>
            <p>Officials from Thailand and Cambodia said that Thai police used tear gas and rubber bullets on Cambodian citizens today. This happened in a border area that both countries say belongs to them. This is the clearest sign that the situation is getting worse since July. In July, both countries agreed to stop fighting after five days of deadly conflict.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Cambodian officials said at least 23 Cambodians were hurt. The Thai army also said some Thai people were hurt, but they did not say how many.</p>
            <p>The fighting happened in a small community on the border between Thailand and Cambodia. Thailand says this area is part of Sa Kaeo province. Cambodia says it is part of Banteay Meanchey province.</p>
            <p>Last month, Thai officials put up a wire fence in this area. For several weeks, people from both sides of the border have been protesting there.</p>
            <p>The land border between Thailand and Cambodia is 817 kilometers long. For more than 100 years, both countries have been arguing over who owns many parts of the border that are not clearly marked. The land border was first drawn by France in 1907 when Cambodia was a French colony.</p>
            <p>In July this year, the argument over land caused fighting at the border. Thailand and Cambodia had their worst fights in decades. At least 48 people died, and hundreds of thousands of people had to leave their homes for a short time.</p>
            <p>After Malaysia helped them talk, the two countries agreed to stop fighting on July 28. Since then, the border has been mostly quiet until now.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Health and Welfare Says Report of "600 Newborns Die Every Year in Taiwan" is Incorrect</h1>
            <p>Some news reports said that "600 newborns die every year in Taiwan." Tonight, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said this is not true. For the past three years, the number of newborns who died before they were four weeks old was 2.8 per 1,000 live births. This number has stayed about the same. In 2024, 374 newborns died, which is 3 fewer than in 2023.</p>
            <p>Today, several news companies reported that an expert said, "600 newborns die every year in Taiwan, and Taiwan has been higher than Japan and South Korea for 20 years." Later, the PR company that gave this information said that the number referred to "babies under one year old."</p>
            <p>However, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Children's Medical Health Information Platform, the "newborn death rate" means the number of babies who die before they are four weeks (28 days) old, for every 1,000 babies born alive.</p>
            <p>Because of this, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Statistics Department said in a press release tonight that the statement "600 newborns die every year in Taiwan" is wrong. However, the Ministry of Health and Welfare did not give the newest numbers for babies under one year old who died, or how Taiwan compares to Japan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare pointed out that in 2024, 374 newborns died. This is 3 fewer than the 377 deaths in 2023. The death rate for newborns was 2.8 per 1,000 live births. If deaths of babies born before 22 weeks of pregnancy or weighing less than 500 grams are not counted, then 242 newborns died. This is 18 fewer than the 260 deaths in 2023. In this case, the death rate per 1,000 live births went down from 1.9 to 1.8.</p>
            <p>Looking at the numbers from 2022 to 2024, the Statistics Department said that the newborn death rate was 2.8 per 1,000 live births, which shows it has stayed steady. If deaths of babies born before 22 weeks of pregnancy or weighing less than 500 grams are not counted, the death rate per 1,000 live births even went down from 2.0 in 2018 to 1.8 in 2024.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare stressed that it continues to improve the network for children's medical care. Since 2021, they have been running the "Optimizing Children's Medical Care Program." This program creates a three-level medical care system. It provides resources from the very beginning of life, promoting care around the time of birth, referring pregnant women with high risks, and offering services for newborns outside the hospital. It also sets up emergency medical care points for children.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare said that at the same time, they are promoting a system where young children have a dedicated doctor. This doctor provides basic care and health management for children under three years old. This will help to reduce preventable deaths of newborns and children, and reach the goal of better health for children.</p>
