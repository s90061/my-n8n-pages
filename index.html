            <h1>New Law Aims for 15 Industrial Holding Companies in 5 Years; Machine Tool and Hotel Industries May Benefit</h1>
            <p>The government of Taiwan today approved a new bill called the 'Company Mergers and Acquisitions Act.' The National Development Council (NDC) said this change will help companies create 'industrial holding companies.' They hope to help set up 15 such companies in 5 years after the law is passed. Industries like machine tools and hotels might be the first to form these companies.</p>
            <p>The government approved the 'Company Mergers and Acquisitions Act Amendment Bill' today. This bill was made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the NDC, and the Ministry of Finance. It aims to remove a tax problem. Right now, when companies form holding companies, their shareholders might have to pay tax on their stock earnings right away. This makes mergers harder.</p>
            <p>The NDC explained that this change in law will let company shareholders who are forming industrial holding companies choose not to include their stock earnings in their basic income for the current year. They will report these earnings later when they actually sell their shares. This will make companies more willing to form industrial holding companies.</p>
            <p>The NDC said that after the law is passed, they expect to help create at least 15 industrial holding companies of a certain size within 5 years.</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching, who leads the NDC, said that many Taiwanese companies are small and don't have enough money for research. This makes them less competitive. Recently, the US tariff policy has made things even harder for industries like machine tools. Last year, he suggested helping companies form industrial holding companies. After many talks with industry groups and experts, and several meetings with different government departments, they put forward this new bill. It will allow companies to use industrial holding companies to bring together resources, become bigger, stronger, and build their brands to compete globally.</p>
            <p>The NDC explained that if the 'Company Mergers and Acquisitions Act' is successfully changed, the NDC will create rules for how to define an industrial holding company. They will work with the Ministry of Finance. These rules will set conditions for the size, type, and business areas of industrial holding companies that can use the tax benefits of this new law. This is to help companies develop industrial holding companies as planned.</p>
            <p>Recently, the effects of the US tariff policy have continued. The government has had talks with different industries. Liu Jing-ching said that many businesses want the government to help them set up industrial holding companies. This law change will not only help Taiwanese companies become bigger and more efficient, but it also answers what businesses really need. This will help local industries grow stronger.</p>
            <p>In the past year, the government has talked to many industries. Recently, companies in the machine tool industry have also said they want to change and form industry groups. They hope to reach the stage of becoming industrial holding companies and compete globally with the government's help.</p>

            <h1>Kind-Hearted American Judge Frank Caprio Dies at 88, Known for Compassionate Rulings</h1>
            <p>Frank Caprio, an 88-year-old retired judge from Rhode Island, USA, has died. He became famous for his kind way of judging and for hosting the TV show 'Caught in Providence.'</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported today that his social media accounts said he passed away peacefully after a long fight with pancreatic cancer.</p>
            <p>Caprio used to be a city judge in Rhode Island. These judges mainly handle small problems like traffic tickets, minor crimes, and small money cases. They are the first judges people see in the US legal system, similar to local court judges in Taiwan. In short videos on YouTube, you can often see Caprio showing understanding to people who came to his court. Many of the issues were small, from not using a turn signal to getting a ticket for a noisy party.</p>
            <p>Caprio once said that his court faced people and cases with "kindness and understanding."</p>
            <p>During his time as a judge, Caprio showed a different kind of personality compared to many TV judges. He was more caring and less likely to argue or criticize. He also used his fame to help with problems like unfairness in the legal system.</p>
            <p>In one video, Caprio said, "The phrase 'liberty and justice for all' means that everyone should have justice. But this is not true. Almost 90% of poor Americans have to deal with civil problems alone. These include healthcare, unfair eviction from their homes, military benefits, and even traffic tickets."</p>
            <p>Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said in a statement, "Judge Caprio not only served the public well, but he also connected with people in a special way. People could not help but feel his warmth and kindness. He was more than a judge; he was a symbol of understanding in court, showing us how law and human kindness can work together."</p>
            <p>One video showed Caprio listening with sympathy to a woman who had lost her son. He then canceled her fines, which were $400 in total. In another video, he canceled a red-light ticket for a bartender who only earned $3.84 per hour. He then used the chance to teach a lesson to viewers, telling them not to run away without paying after eating or drinking.</p>
            <p>Caprio said, "If anyone is watching, I want you to know, don't eat or drink and then run away, because you will get caught eventually. And in the end, it's the people who work hard all day for only $3 an hour who suffer."</p>
            <p>Caprio retired in 2023 from the Providence Municipal Court, ending almost 40 years as a judge.</p>
