            <h1>Semiconductor Exhibition Focuses on Advanced Packaging; NVIDIA's Opinion Affects CoWoP Progress</h1>
            <p>The SEMICON Taiwan 2025 international semiconductor exhibition is happening this week. People are paying attention to new packaging technologies. Besides CoWoS, other technologies like FOPLP, CoPoS, and CoWoP are important. NVIDIA, a big company that makes AI chips, likes some of these technologies. What NVIDIA thinks will guide how advanced packaging develops in the future.</p>
            <p>Making smaller semiconductor chips is getting harder because of physics. Also, new AI and high-performance chips need different parts to work together. This means advanced packaging is very important to make chips work better. It is no longer a small part of making chips. Instead, it is a main technology for making high-end chips perform well.</p>
            <p>Besides CoWoS, InFO, and SoIC from TSMC, other technologies are also getting attention. These include CoPoS, which is like a panel version of CoWoS. There is also FOPLP, a type of panel packaging, and CoWoP. It is said that NVIDIA might use CoWoP, which makes it a key topic.</p>
            <p>Large-sized FOPLP is a main focus for Taiwanese companies. Quanta Computer has changed its panel production lines to make FOPLP packaging this year. Powertech Technology is also working hard on FOPLP lines and expects to make money from them by 2027. ASE Technology Holding has invested 200 million US dollars to build large FOPLP lines in Kaohsiung. Also, Hiwin, a company that makes moving parts, is working on FOPLP wafer moving equipment. Ladon Technology, an equipment company, has received orders for FOPLP testing equipment.</p>
            <p>Manz Smart Tech is working on equipment for RDL (Redistribution Layer) processes using glass bases, which is for panel-level advanced packaging. Ti-Sang supplies similar equipment to European companies that make power management chips.</p>
            <p>Experts say that companies like NXP, STMicroelectronics, AMD, and Qualcomm are working with Taiwanese companies. They use panel-level packaging for power management chips in phones, cars, and wearable devices. Low-earth orbit satellite RF (radio frequency) chips will also use FOPLP. In the future, FOPLP might be used for AI chips.</p>
            <p>For CoPoS technology, people in the industry say that TSMC might start an experimental CoPoS line through its company VisEra in 2026. They might produce it at TSMC's advanced packaging and testing factory in Chiayi. The plan is to start mass production by the end of 2028 or 2029.</p>
            <p>The industry explains that CoPoS panel-level packaging can use the wafer area more efficiently. It can also use glass instead of silicon for some parts, and glass boards instead of organic boards. This helps with problems like bending in large panel-level packaging and makes it cheaper. It can also make data transfer better. This is why CoPoS is a very important advanced packaging technology.</p>
            <p>Companies in Taiwan that might supply CoPoS technology include InnoLux, K&S, Unimicron, Macroblock, Gigabyte, Chroma, U-Well, Hermes-Epitek, Scientech, Topco, Quanta Computer, Unimicron, Nanya, Kinpo, and Wistron.</p>
            <p>Also, it is said that NVIDIA is looking at CoWoP technology for its future research. They might use it in the Rubin Ultra platform, which is expected in the second half of 2027.</p>
            <p>CoWoP technology can skip the step where CoWoS chips are placed on a base. Instead, the chips with silicon layers (Chip-on-Wafer) are put directly onto a PCB (printed circuit board). This means the PCB does the job of the original base.</p>
            <p>An American investment firm says that CoWoP technology removes the base layer. This allows NVIDIA's NVLink, which connects chips quickly, to link the GPU (graphics processing unit) directly to the PCB board. This can greatly improve how well AI chips cool down. It can also help avoid problems with having enough special packaging materials. And it can solve issues like bending and heat in large AI chip advanced packaging.</p>
            <p>However, an Asian firm points out that CoWoP technology still needs to solve problems with making the lines on PCB boards smaller and closer together. If advanced packaging is done during PCB production, the cleanroom standards would need to be much higher. Overall, CoWoP is not ready yet, and it is too early to say that CoWoS will change to CoWoP. It is also important if the supply chain can be ready for CoWoP production.</p>

            <h1>70 Years of Taiwanese Immigration to Brazil / Paper and Ink Connect Memories of Home: Taiwanese People in Brazil Protect Their Culture</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese people have been moving to Brazil for 70 years. Starting with Dr. Yang Yu-chi in 1955, immigrants slowly moved from farming and street sales to starting businesses in technology. They showed strength and new ideas. They kept their culture alive through Chinese schools, newspapers, and events. The second and third generations joined the community and became links between cultures. Food, like the small restaurant "Mapu," holds feelings of home and memories. This journey is not just about moving; it's about deeply growing culture through language, education, beliefs, and food. It helps the spirit of Taiwan continue to grow in Brazil.</p>
            <p>In a small part of an immigrant exhibition in SÃ£o Paulo, there is an old newspaper printed in traditional Chinese characters. It lies quietly in a glass case. The letters look familiar, and the language feels friendly. It's like a soft wind from Formosa (Taiwan) blowing over South America. It is more than just paper and ink. It is a memory that traveled halfway around the world, and now it protects culture in a foreign land.</p>
            <p>This newspaper is called "America Times." Before this, it was called "America Chinese News," which started in 1983. It is the only newspaper in Brazil for Taiwanese people that uses traditional Chinese characters. For many years, it has reported on the community and shown how Taiwanese culture has grown in South America.</p>
            <p>For 70 years, the story of Taiwanese immigrants is not just about starting businesses. It is also a long journey of language and culture. They built churches and mushroom farms in a foreign country. They also planted seeds of culture through education and media.</p>
            <p>Master painter Chang Dai-chien moved to Brazil in 1953 and built a Chinese garden called "Eight Virtues Garden" in Mogi das Cruzes. For a time, it was an important cultural meeting place. But in the 1980s, the local government took the land for a dam, and the garden was covered by water. Also, the SÃ£o Paulo Chinese Catholic Church's Chinese school was the first place for Chinese education. Later, the Chinese Association and other churches started Chinese classes. This made language a bridge to their homeland, and culture quietly grew in the new country.</p>
            <p>The Sheng Ru Chinese School not only teaches Chinese, calligraphy, and dance but also gives scholarships and money for learning materials. This helps second-generation Taiwanese people come back to start businesses. They also use online teaching to make "Taiwanese-style Chinese" popular in Brazil and encourage Brazilian students to study in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The "Brazilian Overseas Youth Cultural Ambassador" (FASCA) program is like a new morning light for the younger generation in keeping culture alive. Taiwan's Overseas Community Affairs Council started this program. It trains young people in language and helps them join community activities. This helps second and third-generation overseas Chinese youth feel proud of their culture and take action in society.</p>
            <p>Director You Zheng-cai of the SÃ£o Paulo Cultural Center says that training young overseas Chinese people locally and having them join community events helps them speak up in a diverse society. They become bridges and promoters of Taiwanese culture in Brazil.</p>
            <p>After visiting the immigrant exhibition and leaving the cultural center, a boy about 15 or 16 years old, wearing clean white shirt and black pants, got into the elevator with everyone. When some older people asked about the floor, he quickly and politely answered. His fluent Chinese and polite manner left a deep impression.</p>
            <p>The way language changes shows how culture changes. The first generation of Taiwanese immigrants spoke Chinese and Taiwanese as their main languages and were Christian. Their lives were about churches and farms. As time passed, the second and third generations slowly started speaking Portuguese. Their Chinese skills became weaker, and a gap in language appeared. Many families try to keep their language identity by taking Chinese classes. However, many people communicate using a mix of Chinese and Portuguese, creating a blend of languages.</p>
            <p>Tang Jie-wen, the deputy editor of the America Times supplement, told CNA that developing Chinese language overseas is very important for keeping culture alive. They created a section called "Chinese Language and Young Writers' Corner." This not only praises the hard work of Chinese schools but also gives children a chance to share their writing, which makes them more interested in learning.</p>
            <p>Also, yearly events like the Chinese Character Culture Festival, Chinese Proficiency Test, and Immigrant Festival performances are not just big events for the community. They are also places to pass on culture and show creativity. Many second and third-generation Taiwanese immigrant children join these events. This makes them more than just ways to look back at history; they are a sign of active language and culture.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese immigrant children show their calligraphy, dance, and recite poems at these events. They not only show what they have learned but also give new meanings to old traditions. They bring the heart of Taiwanese culture into daily life in Brazil.</p>
            <p>These activities help older and younger generations talk to each other. They also let older people see that their culture continues. And they help young people find their identity and confidence by joining in. This also shows that Taiwanese culture is growing again in South America. It means culture is not just kept safe, but it also continues to grow in new ways.</p>

            <h1>70 Years of Taiwanese Immigration to Brazil / Taiwanese Immigrants Overcome Hardships and Start New Businesses in Brazil</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese people have been moving to Brazil for 70 years. Starting with Dr. Yang Yu-chi in 1955, immigrants slowly moved from farming and street sales to starting businesses in technology. They showed strength and new ideas. They kept their culture alive through Chinese schools, newspapers, and events. The second and third generations joined the community and became links between cultures. Food, like the small restaurant "Mapu," holds feelings of home and memories. This journey is not just about moving; it's about deeply growing culture through language, education, beliefs, and food. It helps the spirit of Taiwan continue to grow in Brazil.</p>
            <p>In Brazil, a country in South America, many rich people with millions of dollars are leaving. But Taiwanese people have chosen to stay. They are not afraid of problems with taxes and changes in government. They have built their lives and overcome difficulties. In SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, you can see people waiting in line at Taiwanese restaurants and bubble tea shops. This shows how Taiwanese people have started businesses in Brazil. It also shows the strong mark of their culture in this foreign land.</p>
            <p>A study by Henley & Partners, a company that advises on international migration, says that about 1200 Brazilian millionaires are expected to leave their home country this year. This is 50% more than in 2024. This trend of people leaving shows serious problems in Brazil with safety, money, and stable government. However, Taiwanese people have decided to stay and continue working hard.</p>
            <p>In 1963, a Dutch cargo ship called "Tegelberg" carried six families of church members from farming villages like Yuan-dou and Xi-zhou in Changhua, Taiwan. They left from Keelung Port and sailed for 49 days. On October 9th, they arrived at Santos Port in Brazil. There were also about 50 other Taiwanese immigrants on the ship.</p>
            <p>After that, they worked hard step by step in Brazil, a foreign land. They created a new place for their children and grandchildren.</p>
            <p>From the 1950s to the 1970s, Brazil was a good place for immigrants. Taiwanese people started by selling things door-to-door, like tablecloths, jewelry, and watches, and allowed customers to pay over time. They worked hard and honestly, and their lives in the foreign land slowly became better. Many started as street sellers, saved money, and then opened their own shops, becoming successful in business.</p>
            <p>Over time, Taiwanese business owners started to gather in the area around Rua 25 de MarÃ§o in central SÃ£o Paulo. This is one of the biggest outdoor shopping areas in Latin America. They also gathered in Liberdade, a neighborhood with a strong East Asian culture. These places became important centers for Taiwanese businesses and also places for cultural exchange. From selling things on the street to having permanent shops, and from individual hard work to community connections, the journey of Taiwanese people starting businesses in Brazil is a story of hard work and a strong cultural mark in a foreign land.</p>
            <p>After the energy crisis in 1974, Brazil's economy and government situation got much worse. Prices went up very quickly, like a fire spreading. A product that cost 10 Brazilian Reals in the morning might cost 12 in the afternoon. Taiwanese people had a good habit of saving money, but they had to change to a "two-gold strategy." This meant changing their Brazilian Reals into US dollars and gold and hiding it at home. But this led to many robberies and uneasy nights. Even so, most Taiwanese people have chosen to stay until now. They believe that choices are not given by fate; they are made by oneself.</p>
            <p>For 70 years, the journey of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil has grown like a vine. Today, most of them are middle-class people and business owners. The second and third generations have become a strong part of local society. The community emphasizes the idea of "roots," which is not just remembering their homeland but also protecting their culture.</p>
            <p>In Mogi das Cruzes, a city near SÃ£o Paulo, silver aluminum mushroom farms stretch along the road. These are not just normal farms; they are a sign of Taiwanese people. They worked together to grow mushrooms, started an association, and agreed on prices and techniques. Because of them, 85% of Brazil's mushroom production comes from these immigrants. This is the result of hard work and a symbol of being united.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, in the streets of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio, Taiwanese restaurants and bubble tea shops attract people who wait in line. One small restaurant called "Mapu" quietly brings the spirit of Taiwan into daily life in SÃ£o Paulo. It is not just about food; it is a journey about memories, culture, and family love.</p>
            <p>"Mapu" means "Mother's Garden." In 1979, the first immigrant, Mama Lin, who spoke with a strong Taiwanese Hakka accent, moved to SÃ£o Paulo. She told CNA in an interview, "I started cooking because I missed my hometown so much."</p>
            <p>The restaurant serves home-style Taiwanese dishes: eggplant with miso sauce, slow-cooked braised pork belly for Gua Bao, and a bowl of fragrant Braised Pork Rice. These dishes are not just tasty; they are memories of home.</p>
            <p>Today, Mama Lin no longer cooks herself, but she is still the heart of "Mapu." She checks and tastes the food. Her son, Lin Bing-hong, who is the next owner, continues to find inspiration from traditional Taiwanese dishes.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwanese immigrants continue to make history in Brazil in electronics and technology. This includes companies like BraView Electronics, Ja Tong Trading, and Evergreen Industries.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese people in Brazil are more than just immigrants. For 70 years, they have shown through their actions that they can take root and grow even in difficult times. They have made the spirit of Taiwan quietly blossom in South America.</p>
