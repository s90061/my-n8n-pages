            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang says Pan Men-an was told to talk about the Financial Expenditure Law; Presidential Office: Do not change the main topic</h1>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, who is the leader of the Taiwan People's Party, said that Pan Men-an, the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office, sent a private message to talk about the "Financial Expenditure Law". Today, Presidential Office spokesperson Kuo Ya-hui said that it was a pity the government's request for reconsideration was rejected by the opposition parties. The most important thing now is to fix the mistake quickly. She asked Huang Kuo-chang not to change the main topic. If the Taiwan People's Party had agreed to the reconsideration at first, there would be no disagreement today.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Huang Kuo-chang said that when they were changing the Financial Expenditure Law, President Lai Ching-te asked someone to tell him this: if the Taiwan People's Party group supported the reconsideration of the Financial Expenditure Law, the Democratic Progressive Party group would support the version of the Financial Expenditure Law proposed by the Taiwan People's Party group.</p>
            <p>Today, Huang Kuo-chang explained in an interview that a lawmaker went to the Presidential Office for an event. After the event, Pan Men-an asked the lawmaker to stay and talk about this matter. When the lawmaker came back, he told Huang Kuo-chang about President Lai's idea. Huang Kuo-chang said directly, "No way."</p>
            <p>Because of this, Kuo Ya-hui said it was very sad that the government's request for reconsideration was refused by the opposition parties. This caused harm to the country and its people. The urgent task is to fix these mistakes as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>She pointed out that the country's finances, the balanced development of local areas, and the rights of citizens should not be harmed by wrong laws. These matters are important for everyone, no matter their political party. She asked Huang Kuo-chang not to distract from the main issue. If the Taiwan People's Party had agreed to the reconsideration at the beginning, this problem would not exist today.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Players Compete in Japan's Minor League: Sun Yi-lei and Wang Yan-cheng Both Pitch Well for 8 Innings</h1>
            <p>Today, a big baseball game between two Taiwanese players happened in Japan's second-tier professional league. Sun Yi-lei, a pitcher for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, played very well for 8 innings and did not let the other team score any runs. He also struck out 7 batters. He played against Wang Yan-cheng, a left-handed pitcher for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, who also had a good game, pitching 8 innings and only letting in 1 run.</p>
            <p>In today's game between Rakuten and Nippon-Ham in the Japanese minor league, Sun Yi-lei, the starting pitcher for Nippon-Ham, showed great control. For the first 7 innings, he did not let any opposing players get on base, except for one time in the 3rd inning when he hit a batter with the ball. However, that runner was out later. It was like he got 21 batters out in a row. It was not until the 8th inning, after one out, that he gave up a single hit. But then, he got the next two batters out.</p>
            <p>In total, Sun Yi-lei threw 98 pitches and played for 8 innings. He only allowed 1 hit and hit one batter with a pitch. He struck out 7 batters, and his fastest pitch was 152 kilometers per hour. He did not let any runs score. His ERA (earned run average) in the minor league this season is now 1.76.</p>
            <p>In the same game, Rakuten's starting pitcher was the Taiwanese left-hander Wang Yan-cheng. He only gave up one run in the 3rd inning from a solo home run. He threw 130 pitches over 8 innings, allowed 8 hits, walked 3 batters, and struck out 5. He only let in 1 run, and his fastest pitch was 151 kilometers per hour. His ERA in the minor league is currently 3.55.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-hsiang from Rakuten started the game batting second. He hit one double in 4 at-bats. His batting average is now .239. Even though the Nippon-Ham team was winning at first, Rakuten tied the score in the 9th inning. Then, in the 10th inning, during extra innings, with runners on first and second base, Katsura Mizukami hit a double that brought in 2 runs, putting Rakuten ahead. In the end, Rakuten's minor league team won the game 3 to 1.</p>

            <h1>Citizen Groups Protest Taipei City Government's Plan to Remove Gongguan Roundabout; 150 Police Officers Provide Security</h1>
            <p>The Taipei City Government plans to start removing the Gongguan roundabout and filling in the underground bus road early on September 13. Today, citizen groups will hold a press conference nearby tonight to protest against the city government's decision to remove them. The Taipei City Police Department has arranged 150 police officers to be there for safety.</p>
            <p>In late August, the Taipei City Department of Transportation announced a "Traffic Safety Improvement Project for Roosevelt Road and Keelung Road Intersection." This project will start early on September 13. First, they will fill the underground road, which will take 44 days. Then, they will take down the roundabout, which will take 21 days. The area will become a regular crossroads. The project is expected to finish by late November.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening, more than ten students from universities like National Taiwan University, National Taiwan Normal University, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, and National Chengchi University, along with road rights groups, held a press conference. They shouted slogans like "The project should be paused, the democratic city government must talk with us." After the press conference, they held signs and banners and went to the Gongguan roundabout for a "roundabout circling" flash mob.</p>
            <p>The "Pedestrian Zero Deaths Promotion Alliance" announced information about their "Protect the Roundabout: Roundabout Walk" press conference on Facebook. They made a statement opposing the Taipei City Government's strong decision to remove the Gongguan roundabout, the underground bus road, and the underground pedestrian path.</p>
            <p>The Alliance said that the Taipei City Government has decided to start removing the Gongguan roundabout and bus road early on September 13. Many experts have expressed concerns in the past six months, and local residents, students, and transportation groups have also shown their disagreement. However, the city government is still going ahead with the work without enough discussion, clear facts, or trial runs. They clearly feel that Mayor Chiang Wan-an is not listening.</p>
            <p>The Alliance mentioned that tonight, before the construction starts, they will protest at the Gongguan roundabout and the underground bus road. They are calling for all affected road users to come out and speak up.</p>
            <p>Regarding the project to remove the Gongguan roundabout, the Taipei City Police Department said that three different police stations will work together for security in that area. They expect to have 150 police officers on site to keep things safe.</p>
