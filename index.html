            <h1>Legislator Lin Te-fu Not Present at Recall Meeting; Leader Chu Yueh-hsin Asks People to Vote Yes</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 16 (CNA) â€“ The New Taipei City Election Committee held a public TV meeting today about removing a lawmaker. This meeting was about recalling Lin Te-fu, a lawmaker from the KMT party. Chu Yueh-hsin, who started the recall effort, played music and sang to explain why Lin should be removed. He also said that many older people who support the KMT now feel the party is working too closely with "communists." He asked everyone to vote "yes" to remove Lin on July 26. Lin Te-fu did not come to the meeting.</p>
            <p>In the last election for lawmakers, Lin Te-fu won with 98,260 votes (57.73%) in his area (Yonghe District and part of Zhonghe District). Chuang Ming-yuan from the DPP party got 50,613 votes (29.73%). Chen Kai-ning from Taiwan Observers got 21,345 votes (12.54%).</p>
            <p>The group wanting to remove Lin is led by Chu Yueh-hsin. They say Lin Te-fu supported laws that are too friendly to China, used his power wrongly, cut important money from budgets, and did not do a good job as a lawmaker. They want voters to remove him to protect democracy and local growth.</p>
            <p>Voting to remove 24 KMT lawmakers and Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an (who is currently suspended) will happen on July 26. Public TV meetings about these recall cases started today in different areas.</p>
            <p>Chu Yueh-hsin, also a famous singer, used singing in parts of his two speeches at the meeting to explain why Lin Te-fu should be removed. He said that people should take care of their own communities and save their own country.</p>
            <p>Chu Yueh-hsin looked back at how the recall effort started. He thanked the people in the Shuanghe area. He said that at first, they only got one or two signatures for the recall each day. But now, they have enough signatures, and the vote will happen on July 26.</p>
            <p>Chu Yueh-hsin said that during the signing process, many people told him they usually support the KMT. He mentioned that many old men who fought in the "August 23rd Artillery Battle" (a battle against the Chinese Communists) risked their lives to fight the Chinese Communist Party and protect Taiwan. These people feel that the KMT used to be against the Communists, but now they think the KMT is working with them.</p>
            <p>Chu Yueh-hsin said that based on a lot of information, Lin Te-fu acts like a "voting machine" in the Legislative Yuan (Taiwan's parliament). He does not speak much about public issues. He has always been the same: he always approves laws that are good for China and bad for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Chu Yueh-hsin said, "We are not trying to remove Lin Te-fu just because he didn't do anything." But he added that Lin Te-fu supported bad proposals from KMT caucus leader Fu Kun-chi in the parliament, which Chu called "very bad." He said it is right for Lin Te-fu to be recalled.

            <h1>HuanGe App Directors Charged for Illegally Copying 518 Songs and Earning Over NT$30 Million</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 16 (CNA) â€“ The "HuanGe APP," a popular singing social app in Taiwan, is accused of illegally copying 518 songs. They reportedly earned over NT$30.28 million from this. Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office has charged Mr. Chen, the person in charge of Quanmin Music Company, which runs the app, and Mr. Chang, the marketing director. They are charged with breaking copyright laws.</p>
            <p>According to the charges from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, Quanmin Music Company is the Taiwan branch of a Hong Kong company called MAXBROS LIMITED. This company runs the "HuanGe APP." Mr. Chen and Mr. Chang are accused of copying songs from several famous Taiwanese singers and putting them on the "HuanGe APP" around May 2022.</p>
            <p>Music companies like Rock Records and Warner Music said that Quanmin Music Company copied and uploaded their copyrighted songs to the "HuanGe APP" without their permission. This allowed many users to see or download the songs. The music companies felt this violated their rights. So, they reported it to the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Interior National Police Agency.</p>
            <p>After looking into the case, the prosecutor decided that Mr. Chen and Mr. Chang were involved in illegally using 518 songs. They are charged with crimes under the copyright law, specifically for copying someone else's work without permission and for sharing it publicly without permission. The prosecutor also asked to take away the money they made illegally. However, a brand specialist named Wang was not charged because there was not enough evidence against him.
