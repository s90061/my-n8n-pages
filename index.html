            <h1>Trump: Putin will face serious problems if he does not stop Ukraine war</h1>
            <p>A big meeting between the US and Russian leaders will happen on August 15 in Alaska, USA. US President Trump said today that if Russian President Putin does not agree to end the war in Ukraine, Russia will face "very serious problems." But Trump did not say what these problems would be.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump spoke to reporters at an event today. He said that if Putin does not agree to end the war in Ukraine during their meeting, Russia will face "very serious problems."</p>
            <p>However, when asked if this means new punishments or taxes, Trump did not answer directly.</p>
            <p>Trump had previously threatened more punishments for countries that buy Russian energy. He also announced higher taxes on goods from India. He said that in the future, other countries might also face more punishments, possibly including China.</p>
            <p>Trump is expected to meet Putin in person on August 15 in Anchorage, the largest city in Alaska. News reports say this will be the first time a sitting US President and a Russian leader have a summit meeting since 2021.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump said today that after his meeting with Putin, he plans to have another meeting soon. This meeting would include him, Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Russia has recently increased its attacks on Ukraine. Also, Zelenskyy was not invited to the US-Russia summit on August 15. This makes people more worried that Trump and Putin might make a deal that forces Ukraine to give up difficult things.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Trump said that both Kyiv and Moscow must give up some land to end the war. The meeting this week between Trump and Putin will show right away if Putin is willing to make a deal. Zelenskyy has said he will not give up any land that was taken by force.</p>
            <p>The war in Ukraine has been going on for almost three and a half years. Since Trump returned to the White House, he has been trying to help Russia and Ukraine stop fighting for good. But so far, he has not gotten Russia to agree to any important things.</p>

            <h1>ESPN: NBA Trail Blazers find buyer, sold for NT$120 billion, staying in Portland</h1>
            <p>Sources have told ESPN that Tom Dundon, who owns the Carolina Hurricanes hockey team in the NHL, has agreed to buy the NBA team Portland Trail Blazers. The team used to belong to Paul Allen, one of the founders of Microsoft, who has passed away. The price is a bit more than 4 billion US dollars (about 120 billion New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>According to how much NBA teams were valued this year by the US business news CNBC, the Trail Blazers were one of the least valuable teams, at 3.65 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>ESPN, a US sports news company, also reported, citing people who know the situation, that Tom Dundon wants the team to stay in Portland.</p>
            <p>Paul Allen, who started Microsoft with Bill Gates, bought the Portland Trail Blazers in 1988 for 70 million US dollars (about 2.1 billion New Taiwan dollars). He died from cancer in 2018. In his will, he said the team should be sold "at some point."</p>
            <p>After Allen died, his sister, Jody, owned the team through the Paul Allen Trust.</p>
