            <h1>Li Yang Becomes First Sports Minister, Aims to Make Taiwan Sports Stronger</h1>
            <p>The new Ministry of Sports will officially start on September 9th. The Executive Yuan announced today that Li Yang, a famous Taiwanese badminton player and winner of two Olympic gold medals, will be the first Sports Minister. Li Yang said he will work very hard to make Taiwan's sports stronger in the future.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan revealed its new "AI Action Cabinet 2.0" today. Sixteen cabinet members are changing roles. Li Yang, who has won two Olympic gold medals in men's doubles badminton, will lead the new Ministry of Sports, which opens on September 9th.</p>
            <p>Li Yang is 30 years old. He and his partner Wang Chi-lin, known as the "Wang-Li duo," won two gold medals in men's doubles badminton at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2024 Paris Olympics. This was the first time a team won two gold medals in a row in this event.</p>
            <p>After the 2024 Paris Olympics, Li Yang decided to stop playing professionally. He retired and became an associate professor at National Taiwan Sport University last September. He used his skills to lead the school's badminton team, which did well in this year's National University Games and national badminton rankings.</p>
            <p>Li Yang's desire to help Taiwan's sports world was not a sudden idea. After the Paris Olympics, he said he wanted to run for chairman of the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association. He wanted to start by working in the sport he knows best. Now, he will be the Sports Minister, which is the top position in Taiwan's sports administration.</p>
            <p>When interviewed, Li Yang said, "Taking this job means a lot to me, and it comes with even more responsibility. I will use 200% of my effort and energy to do things well. Besides sports policies, as a former athlete, I will pay special attention to the needs of athletes."</p>
            <p>Li Yang, who is a Leo, has strong opinions and is very careful about details. He once said that after retiring, he gave many public speeches, more than 30 of them. He even paid for professional teachers to help him speak better and more completely.</p>
            <p>Li Yang's journey in politics is similar to his badminton career. In junior high school, he was not a good badminton player. Even in high school, he could not join the top-level (A-level) players. His father even asked him to stop playing badminton and focus on his studies. After high school, he chose to study at Taipei College of Business, which was not a common choice for badminton players. But in the end, he became a famous Olympic gold medalist.</p>
            <p>It was said that the new Ministry of Sports asked several athletes to be the minister. Finally, Li Yang, who has a good reputation, took the job. This was something he had never thought about before this year.</p>
            <p>Li Yang said, "Life is like this. Some things will lead you in new directions. But I always believed that no matter what my role is, my original intention and goal remain the same: to make Taiwan's sports better. Now I have this chance to help more people, and perhaps this shows people trust and expect things from me."</p>
            <p>Li Yang emphasized that he is mentally ready. "Just like when I was a player, I always said, 'The shuttlecock doesn't touch the ground, never give up.' Now I will use this spirit to keep fighting in my new role."</p>
            <p>His former partner, Wang Chi-lin, who is now playing in the World Badminton Championships in Paris, sent his best wishes to Li Yang: "I hope he can do more for Taiwan's sports in the future."</p>
            <p>Li Yang also posted on Facebook today, writing, "New journey, same original intention." He introduced six main sports policies. In the future, he will act to meet everyone's expectations and make Taiwan better through sports.</p>
            <p>Besides Li Yang as the Sports Minister, the two political deputy ministers will be Zheng Shih-chung, the current Director-General of the Sports Administration, and Huang Qi-huang, the Executive Director of the Sports Science Center. Hong Zhi-chang, the current Deputy Director-General of the Sports Administration, will be the permanent deputy minister.</p>

            <h1>Legislator Unhappy No Official Investigation into Yeh Ping-cheng Case; Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao: Will Follow Law to Review</h1>
            <p>Yeh Ping-cheng, a former Deputy Minister of Education, was involved in a case where he supposedly shared private information about someone in a gender equality case. Legislator Wu Pei-yi from the Democratic Progressive Party is unhappy that the Ministry of Education has not yet started an official investigation into this information leak. Today, she directly criticized Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao, saying he failed in his duties and asked the Ministry to start an investigation quickly. Cheng Ying-yao did not promise to do so. He only said that they would seriously review the matter and act according to the law.</p>
            <p>Today, committees from the Legislative Yuan, including Finance, Interior Affairs, Economy, Education and Culture, Transportation, and Social Welfare and Health Environment, held a joint meeting. They discussed a special budget plan for fixing things after Typhoon Danas and the heavy rains on July 28th.</p>
            <p>During the questioning, Legislator Wu Pei-yi said that the Gender Equality Committee looked into Yeh Ping-cheng's case. They gave the Ministry of Education two suggestions. First, issues about breaking personal data laws are not part of the Gender Equality Committee's job, so the Ministry of Education should investigate them. Second, questions about whether government officials broke public service laws are also not the Gender Equality Committee's job, so the Ministry of Education should investigate those too.</p>
            <p>Wu Pei-yi asked Cheng Ying-yao, "Doesn't the Ministry of Education know it can start an investigation?" She added, "How long has it been since the case happened? Does the Gender Equality Committee still need to tell the Ministry of Education to start an official investigation? Legislators from the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee also sent a letter to the Ministry of Education in April. The Ministry could have started an investigation in April. Did they start one then?"</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao said that the Ministry of Education understands that Yeh Ping-cheng shared information online improperly. At the time, everyone thought he broke gender equality laws. However, according to all the rules, Yeh Ping-cheng was not directly involved in the Gender Equality Committee's work at National Taiwan University, nor was he in charge of gender equality issues at the Ministry of Education.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao's explanation made Wu Pei-yi unhappy. She kept asking, "Did you start an official investigation?" Cheng Ying-yao admitted that the Gender Equality Committee's first decision was no, they did not start an investigation.</p>
            <p>Wu Pei-yi said, "No wonder people outside say the Ministry of Education is protecting him. It's been 4 months, and you've gone in circles. It's shameful and a failure. When will the Ministry of Education start an official investigation?" She stressed that just because someone leaves their job does not mean the problem is solved. The truth must be found out. This issue is very important because if a victim's personal information is at risk of being leaked, victims might not dare to complain in the future.</p>
            <p>Because Cheng Ying-yao did not promise to start an official investigation, Legislator Lai Hui-yuan, who was leading the meeting, encouraged Cheng Ying-yao to make a promise. Cheng Ying-yao only said that the Ministry of Education would certainly act according to the law and seriously review the matter internally.</p>
            <p>Wu Pei-yi said it has been 4 months, so the Ministry should act quickly. If an investigation is needed, it should be done.</p>

            <h1>Vice President Hsiao: Insurance is Backup, a Strong Support When Storms Come</h1>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said today that insurance is not always obvious when things are calm. But when bad weather or problems happen, it becomes the strongest support. Future challenges for the insurance industry include climate change, which brings more extreme events. Also, changes in how many old and young people there are will increase the need for medical care and long-term care. Digital technology and AI will also change the types of risks. Insurance is like a backup plan; it is more than just a paper contract. It is the power that helps families when risks appear.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao attended the "11th Taiwan Insurance Excellence Awards Ceremony" today. Many important people were there, including Chen Yen-liang, the Deputy Chairperson of the Financial Supervisory Commission; Huang Hung-chih, the Chairperson of the Taiwan Insurance Institute; Chen Hui-you, the Chairperson of the Life Insurance Association; Chen Wan-hsiang, the Chairperson of the Non-Life Insurance Association; and leaders from many insurance companies.</p>
            <p>In her speech, Vice President Hsiao said that insurance is often not noticed when everything is good. But when storms come, it becomes the strongest support. Taiwan is in an earthquake zone around the Pacific Ocean. Typhoons and heavy rains happen often. Also, global economics and politics are not stable. So, managing risks is not just a job for experts. It is a very important task for national safety and for society to be strong. The insurance industry is the most important part of this safety net.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao pointed out that the professional skills and trust of people in the insurance industry connect every family, business, and society closely. This safety net handles unexpected problems and also people's hopes. For many, insurance is not something they think about every day. But everyone knows that insurance is a backup. Insurance is not just a contract; it is the power that supports each family when risks arrive.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said that the insurance industry always stays ahead of changes. Future challenges include climate change, which brings more frequent extreme events. Especially, changes in the population mean that the need for medical care and long-term care is growing quickly. Digitalization and the development of AI will also change how risks appear. This means that the insurance industry will need to be more creative and have a stronger sense of purpose in the future. She praised the insurance people present and thanked them for being a stable force in society.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said she believes that giving out these awards will encourage more people in the insurance industry to keep improving. This will make insurance more than just a policy; it will be a real and trustworthy promise, and a force that protects Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Huang Hung-chih said that the Taiwan Insurance Excellence Awards started in 2005 and happen every two years. This is the 11th time. Looking back at recent challenges, such as changes in global politics and the effects of extreme weather, these have brought new risks to the insurance industry. But the insurance industry has always stayed true to its main goal of providing protection. They work together to keep the industry stable and offer strong safety. He hopes that insurance companies will gather strength to face future challenges and continue to be a force that stabilizes society. He also gave his highest respect on behalf of the organizing committee.</p>
            <p>Wu Chung-shu, who leads the judging committee, said that 40 companies took part this year, and they submitted 159 cases. This time, 35 experts and people from the industry served as judges. After initial checks, further reviews, and final decisions, the winners were chosen. The goal was to protect consumers' rights and also help Taiwan's insurance industry grow steadily.</p>
