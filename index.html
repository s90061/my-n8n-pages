            <h1>Female Lawyer in Tainan Held for Helping Scam Group</h1>
            <p>A female lawyer in Tainan, Ms. He, is involved in a fraud case. She is believed to be a helper for a scam group. The Tainan District Prosecutors Office questioned her today and asked for her to be held. Tonight, the Tainan District Court decided to keep her in custody and said she cannot see or talk to anyone.</p>
            <p>The Tainan District Court said tonight that Ms. He is suspected of breaking several laws. These include laws about organized crime, taking money through fraud, money laundering, and sharing secret information. The court thinks she is very likely guilty of these crimes.</p>
            <p>Also, Ms. He was both a part of the scam group and the lawyer for the person who reported the crime. She used her time during police questioning to find out secret information and then told it to others. This helped the scam group. Her crimes are serious. She did not fully tell the truth. There is a risk that she might destroy evidence, work with other people involved, or talk to witnesses.</p>

            <h1>Taipower: Hard Work of Employees in Typhoon Repairs Is Real, Not Staged</h1>
            <p>Regarding claims from the Taiwan Power Industry Union that Taipower workers were "posing for photos," Taipower said that their workers' hard work during typhoon repairs should not be called fake. They stated that the photos of repairs are real and taken during actual work, with no requests for posing. Taipower added that the Taiwan Power Union, which has nearly 29,000 members (more than 99% of the company's employees), truly represents most workers' opinions. The Power Industry Union, however, has only about 100 members.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Dannas caused a lot of damage in southern Taiwan. Today, the Taiwan Power Industry Union said in a statement that low-level employees worked extra hours to fix damage from the typhoon. They also claimed that these workers were asked to pose for photos while eating. The union said that high-level government officials then used these photos to promote the idea of "giving Taipower billions of dollars."</p>
            <p>In a press release tonight, Taipower explained that the repair photos they shared were real pictures taken by workers on site during the actual repair work. There were no orders or requests for workers to pose. Sometimes, when news reporters came to take pictures, they might have asked workers to cooperate a little for their reports.</p>
            <p>Taipower said they fully understand and respect that their employees care about their working conditions. This typhoon caused damage to power facilities in the Chiayi-Tainan area like never before. About 3,500 power poles fell down, which is a huge and serious problem. Over ten thousand people have worked on repairs so far, and they are still working.</p>
            <p>Taipower stated that the company highly respects and thanks every employee for their hard work and effort. They will also continue to improve the real benefits for repair workers, such as bonuses, special paid leave, and danger pay. They hope that the public will continue to strongly support the frontline repair workers.</p>

            <h1>Israel Bombs Syrian Military Base, Warns Against Harming Druze People</h1>
            <p>After warning the Syrian government, led by Islamists, to leave the Druze minority group alone in their main area, Sweida province, Israel today bombed a Syrian military building in Damascus.</p>
            <p>An organization that watches the situation said that nearly 250 people have died in fights between different groups in Sweida province, which is in southern Syria.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that more than 100 people died in conflicts between the Druze people and local Bedouin tribes. The Syrian government army went into Sweida city, where most people are Druze, yesterday. They said they were there to check on a ceasefire agreement made with Druze leaders.</p>
            <p>However, people who saw what happened reported that the government army and Bedouin people worked together to attack Druze fighters and ordinary people. They caused a lot of killing in the city.</p>
            <p>In April and May, the government army and Druze fighters fought in Sweida province and near Damascus. More than 100 people died. This recent conflict is the worst violence since then.</p>
            <p>Since December last year, when the Islamist-led Syrian government took power from former president Bashar al-Assad, there has been tension between them and religious and ethnic minority groups.</p>
            <p>Israel's Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, told the Damascus government to "not interfere with the Druze people in Sweida province."</p>
            <p>He demanded that the Syrian army leave. He promised that the Israeli army would not stop its attacks until they leave. Katz stressed that "if this message is not understood," Israel will "increase the level of its response against this (Syrian) government."</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Israeli military announced that they had attacked a Syrian military building.</p>
