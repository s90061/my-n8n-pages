            <h1>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Trouble; Justice Minister Asks Him to Leave</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, September 5, CNA) Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, who is also the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is in a difficult situation. People are trying to force him to leave his position. Besides Taro Aso, a top advisor for the LDP, the Minister of Justice, Keisuke Suzuki, today also said he wants a new party leader to be chosen. He is the first person from the Prime Minister's cabinet to openly ask for this.</p>
            <p>The LDP usually chooses its leader every three years. A leader can serve up to three terms. If there is an early election for the party leader, it means people are trying to make the current leader step down before their term ends.</p>
            <p>Since Mr. Ishiba became Prime Minister last autumn, the LDP has not done well in elections. They lost in the House of Representatives election last year, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election in June this year, and the House of Councillors election in July. For the first time in 70 years, the party does not have more than half of the seats in both houses of the parliament. Because of this, some members of the party want Mr. Ishiba to leave.</p>
            <p>The LDP will decide on September 8 if they will hold an early election for the party leader. Members of parliament and others will present their opinions on this day. To hold an early election for the party leader, more than half of the people must agree. This means 172 people must agree from a total of 295 members of parliament (not including the Speakers of both houses) and 47 representatives from the 47 local party offices. On September 8, people must register with their real names and personally give their opinion papers to the LDP headquarters.</p>
            <p>Keisuke Suzuki wrote on his blog today. He said, "The ruling party lost badly in the last general election. We do not have enough seats in either house of parliament. Many problems need to be solved, and politics cannot stop. To make people trust the LDP again, the party needs to work together and start fresh."</p>
            <p>Suzuki said, "In the current situation, holding an early election for the party leader, where many party members can take part, is the best choice." He also said he will sign the document asking for an early party leader election and hand it in.</p>
            <p>Suzuki is the first cabinet member in Mr. Ishiba's government to ask for an early election for the party leader.</p>
            <p>Taro Aso, who is a top advisor for the LDP and a former Prime Minister, also leads the "Aso faction," which is the only group in the LDP right now. On September 3, he gave a speech at a meeting of his faction and said he also wants an early election for the party leader.</p>
            <p>This evening, Mr. Aso had dinner with Toshimitsu Motegi, a former Secretary-General of the LDP, at a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo. People think they talked about the growing calls to remove Mr. Ishiba and who might become the next leader after him.</p>
            <p>In the LDP, the "Motegi faction," which used to be led by Mr. Motegi, mostly has experienced members of parliament (those who have been elected about five times) and younger members. At least a dozen of these members also want an early election for the party leader.</p>
            <p>The Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported that the LDP's Tokyo branch met today at the LDP headquarters. About 150 people attended, including Shinji Inoue, the head of the Tokyo branch and a member of parliament, as well as members of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and local ward councils. At the meeting, everyone agreed to ask for an early election for the party leader.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Mr. Inoue told reporters, "Many people at the meeting said that the results of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election and the House of Councillors election were very bad. The leader is responsible for this. Unlike other local LDP branches, our election results in Tokyo were truly difficult."</p>
            <p>In the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election in June this year, the LDP won 21 seats, including those they added later. In the House of Councillors election in July, for the Tokyo area (where 6 seats were re-elected and 1 seat was filled in a special election), the LDP only won 1 seat.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ishiba recently said sorry for the LDP's big loss in the House of Councillors election at a meeting of LDP members from both houses of parliament. However, he also said he wants to stay in his position.</p>
            <p>Satoshi Fujii, a professor at Kyoto University, strongly criticized Mr. Ishiba on a TV show. He said, "If Mr. Ishiba stays as Prime Minister, Japan will be ruined."</p>
            <p>Professor Fujii explained, "Mr. Ishiba says he wants to stay and improve Japan's economy by dealing with rising prices. But Mr. Ishiba has been in charge for one year, and the economy has not improved at all. We cannot expect the economy to get better in the future."</p>
            <p>Professor Fujii also criticized Mr. Ishiba's foreign policy. He said, "Mr. Ishiba thinks he has achieved good results in foreign affairs. However, today, US President Donald Trump issued an order stating that the US will decide how Japan invests 80 trillion Japanese Yen (550 billion US dollars) in the US. If this happens, Japan faces a very high risk of losing a lot of its national benefits."</p>
            <p>Professor Fujii also pointed out, "In the elections for both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, the LDP became a minority ruling party, meaning they did not win more than half of the seats. If the party leader does not have to take responsibility for such a big loss, then the idea of responsibility will disappear in Japan, and it will be hard to keep order."</p>

            <h1>Broadcom Gets a Big Order for AI Chips, Stock Price Jumps</h1>
            <p>(New York, September 5, CNA) Broadcom, an American company that makes computer chips, announced today that it has a new customer. This customer placed an order for US$10 billion (about NT$300 billion) worth of artificial intelligence (AI) chips. People think the new customer is OpenAI, the company that made ChatGPT. Because of this good news, Broadcom's stock price went up by 15% when the market opened today.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Broadcom's new order makes people believe the company will do well in the race to develop generative AI. This also makes Broadcom stronger in the market for custom-made chips. Big technology companies do not want to rely only on Nvidia's expensive and limited AI chips. So, they are looking for other companies to supply them with chips.</p>
            <p>Analysts from well-known financial companies on Wall Street, such as J.P. Morgan, Bernstein, and Morgan Stanley, all think that the new customer who ordered chips from Broadcom is probably OpenAI. They believe this because of when the order was placed and how big it is.</p>
            <p>Reuters already reported last year that OpenAI was working with Broadcom to create its first own chip.</p>
            <p>Now, Broadcom also expects its income from AI products to "grow much more" in its 2026 financial year.</p>
