Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke about the situation in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on July 11. He said that if people care about peace in the Taiwan Strait, they should stop "Taiwan independence" groups from growing. He also stated that "Taiwan and mainland China belonging to one China is the most basic truth of the Taiwan Strait."

Wang Yi also talked about the South China Sea. He said that the Philippines' case about the South China Sea nine years ago was not valid because it did not follow the right rules. He also mentioned that the ruling about Taiping Island, which is a big island, was wrong when it was called a rock. He believes that some countries outside the region are causing trouble in the South China Sea to gain benefits.

Wang Yi said that China and Southeast Asian countries are working together to keep the South China Sea stable. He suggested three things for the East Asia Summit: to talk more, to focus on development, and to be more open.

**Ministry of Interior: Young Men Going Abroad for Summer Must Apply**

The Ministry of Interior in Taiwan has a reminder for young men. If you were born in 2006 or earlier and have not yet done your military service, you need to apply if you want to travel abroad during the summer.

You should apply online using the "Short-Term Exit Application System for Conscripts." You must apply between 3 and 30 days before you plan to leave the country. If your application is approved, you can travel abroad many times within one month without needing to apply again.

However, if you are about to start your military service or if you have returned to Taiwan late from a previous trip, you might not be able to get approval. In such cases, you must complete your military duties first. If you have any problems with the online system, you can ask for help from your local government office or call the 1996 service line.

**Financial Institutions: Get Ready for CRS Checks and Avoid These 3 Mistakes**

Taiwan's tax authorities will start checking over 1800 financial institutions, like banks and insurance companies, in July and August. These checks are for CRS, which stands for Common Reporting Standard. It's a system to share financial information between countries to stop people from hiding money to avoid taxes.

Financial institutions must be careful to avoid three main mistakes. First, their internal rules for CRS might not be complete, especially for special accounts. Second, they might not check the tax ID numbers of their customers correctly. Third, they might miss some accounts that need to be reported because of problems with their computer systems.

If financial institutions do not follow the rules, they can face big fines. For example, not reporting information can lead to a fine of up to NT$300,000. Not doing proper checks can result in an even larger fine, up to NT$10 million. The government reminds people who have money or income overseas to report it honestly to avoid problems.
