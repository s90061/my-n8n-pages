            <h1>Tainan Nanhua Gets 350 mm of Rain Again; Wu Derong Says Central and Southern Taiwan Will Still Have Dangerous Rain</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chang Hsiung-feng, Taipei, August 3) According to the weather agency's website, by 8 AM today, Tainan's Nanhua district had the most rain, with 350 millimeters. Weather expert Wu Derong said that the southwest monsoon will bring many days of rain to central and southern Taiwan today and tomorrow. Typhoon Bailu might form today, but it will not affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>According to data from the Central Weather Agency, by 8 AM today, Tainan City's Nanhua District had the highest total rainfall at 350 millimeters. In other areas, Kaohsiung City's Jiaxian District received 243 millimeters, and Pingtung County's Wutai Township received 201 millimeters.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column today that the newest European weather model shows the southwest monsoon will bring many days of rain to central and southern Taiwan today and tomorrow. The atmosphere is unstable, so there will be local showers or thunderstorms with a lot of rain that can cause damage. There is also a chance of severe weather in small areas, like lightning, strong winds, and sudden heavy rain. The affected areas will become larger in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong warned that people in mountain areas should be careful of landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides. Low-lying areas should prepare for floods. The eastern part of Taiwan, which is on the leeward side, will be less affected. It might have some short rain, but when it doesn't rain, the weather will be hot and humid.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong said that the latest European model shows the southwest monsoon will get weaker and move north on August 5th. The pattern of heavy rainfall for many days will change, but the atmosphere will still be unstable, with some areas having heavy rain. Central and southern Taiwan should watch out for how this rain affects them. From August 6th to 10th, the Pacific high-pressure system will cause sunny and very hot summer weather everywhere. There might be some short local rain in mountain areas in the afternoon. The highest temperature across Taiwan will go above 38 degrees Celsius, so people should use sunscreen and try not to get heatstroke.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong stated that the latest "Typhoon Probability Map" from the weather agency shows that Tropical Storm Krovanh is east of Japan and is moving away to the northeast faster. Another tropical low-pressure system is south of Japan. It is part of a monsoon system, so it has strong vertical wind shear, and its development is slow. It is expected to be named Tropical Storm Bailu today. Guided by the southwest monsoon, it will generally follow Krovanh and move away to the northeast, so neither typhoon will affect Taiwan.

            <h1>Only "Zombie Fortresses" Left for NT$70,000 Rent? San Francisco Faces a Rental War</h1>
            <p>In the San Francisco Bay Area, high rent is not a new thing. Since the internet boom in the 1990s helped the technology industry grow, rents have gone up a lot. They only went down a little during the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>About three years ago, when the reporter first arrived in San Francisco, the city was still quiet because of the pandemic. Renting a place felt expensive but was not hard. There were many types of rental homes available, such as studios, apartments, townhouses, and single-family houses.</p>
            <p>However, finding a suitable place to live in the San Francisco Bay Area recently has become as difficult as applying for a dream full-time job.</p>
            <p>Rebecca Hsu, a new tech worker from Taiwan, is moving to San Francisco after graduating from UC Berkeley. She wants to find a room or studio with an elevator for $2,500 a month (about NT$75,000). But there are very few choices. For example, there are very old shared apartments on hillsides, or a few places in the Tenderloin area, known for homeless people and open-air drug markets.</p>
            <p>She was surprised that the old shared apartment room, which was far away and only had space for a single bed, a table, chairs, and no closet, had 4 or 5 groups of people looking at it at the same time. And it was rented out in just two days.</p>
            <p>She remembered the places in the Tenderloin area well: "When I went into that building, it felt like entering a zombie fortress."</p>
            <p>Competition for 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom places is even tougher. The reporter asked on social media and got many replies.</p>
            <p>Sofia and her husband, with one child, wanted to find a 2-bedroom apartment for under $4,200 a month in the safer western part of San Francisco. They had to compete with dozens of people. To please the landlord, they wrote detailed letters about themselves and included their resumes.</p>
            <p>Some people said that in the past, tech workers could easily find rentals because they had good jobs. But now, the job market in the tech industry is not stable, so some landlords do not want to sign contracts. Another person shared that even though four people together earned $350,000 a year, five landlords still said no to them.</p>
            <p>Tina, who has lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for more than 20 years and is a landlord, told the reporter that she had only heard of buying a house being this crazy. "For renting, at most, houses rent out very quickly, but this is the first time I've heard of people offering more money to get a place."</p>
            <p>Data from the US online rental platform Apartment List shows that the average apartment rent in San Francisco in June went up by 11% compared to the same time last year. This was the highest increase in the whole country. During the same period, the average rent in the US went down by 0.7%.</p>
            <p>Maggie Chien, a real estate agent in Silicon Valley, noticed that renting in the San Francisco Bay Area has become much more popular recently. If a landlord gets a new tenant, the rent can go up by about 10%. If they let the old tenant stay, the rent can go up by about 5%.</p>
            <p>Maggie Chien has many properties in the Stanford University area, about an hour's drive from San Francisco. She said that now, every time there's an open house, many people come. Two weeks ago, 30 people came to see a 3-bedroom house for $5,000 a month. The number of rental applications is about three times what it was during the pandemic.</p>
            <p>She pointed out that businesses and schools returning to in-person work and classes is one of the main reasons for the recent big increase in rental demand.</p>
            <p>Rising mortgage interest rates also have an effect. Eric Chang, who manages properties, said that if you buy a house near Apple, Nvidia, or Google campuses, the total monthly cost would be about 3 to 4 times the rent. With high interest rates, loan payments are a big burden, so more people might choose to rent and wait to see what happens.</p>
            <p>The messy rental market also shows that the industry is changing quickly. It also highlights that there is still a big lack of housing in the area.</p>
            <p>In the San Francisco Bay Area, many industries rely on technology. Artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing in new talented people and money. At the same time, the biotech industry, which grew very fast before the pandemic, is now quickly getting smaller. These big changes are causing a lot of movement in society.</p>
            <p>Second, about 85% of housing land in the San Francisco Bay Area only allows single-family homes. Many areas also limit building height to no more than 40 feet (about 4 stories). This means the land is not used very well.</p>
            <p>For the past year or so, the reporter has started to see more apartment buildings being built only for rent, with prices set by the market.</p>
            <p>Recent local news surveys show that San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has a high approval rating of 73% after 100 days in office, which is a good result. But on the important issue of "providing enough affordable housing," only 36% of people approved. This was the worst score among all issues. The housing problem is like a tight spell on the city.</p>
            <p>Rebecca Hsu looked at 15 places before she found a decent place to live. She said that in Taiwan, NT$20,000 could get you a pretty good studio apartment in Taipei City's Xinyi District. But in the San Francisco Bay Area, it often costs NT$80,000.</p>
            <p>It is clear that as more and more tech workers start to feel pressure from renting, the San Francisco rental market will become even more for the elite. (Edited by: Chen Yen-chun) 1140803</p>

            <h1>Former Special Prosecutor Smith, Who Sued Trump, Will Be Investigated</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, August 2, comprehensive foreign report) US media reported today that US officials have started an investigation into former special prosecutor Jack Smith. Smith was in charge of two federal criminal cases against President Trump.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the Office of Special Counsel told "The New York Times" that they are looking into whether Smith might have broken the Hatch Act. This law stops federal employees from doing political activities while they are working.</p>
            <p>It was reported that Republican Senator Tom Cotton had asked the Office of Special Counsel to check if Smith's actions were meant to influence the 2024 election.</p>
            <p>The Office of Special Counsel, which checks how federal employees act, has not yet replied to AFP's request for comments.</p>
            <p>Smith was made a special prosecutor in 2022. He accused Trump of planning to overturn the 2020 election results and of mishandling secret documents after leaving office.</p>
            <p>Trump said these two accusations were not true. He also tried to say that these actions were politically motivated, claiming that the Department of Justice had become a weapon used against him.</p>
            <p>Neither of these two cases went to trial. After Trump won the presidential election in November 2024, Smith dropped all charges right away. This was because of the Justice Department's rule not to charge a sitting president.</p>
            <p>Smith resigned before Trump could carry out his campaign promise to fire him.</p>
            <p>Under the Hatch Act, the most serious punishment is losing your job. But this does not apply to Smith because he has already resigned. (Translated by: Chen Yu-ting/Edited by: Liu Wen-yu) 1140803</p>
