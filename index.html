**Elon Musk's Neuralink Gets FDA Approval for Human Trials**

Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin its first human trials. This is a significant step forward for the company, which aims to develop implantable devices that can treat neurological conditions and eventually enable humans to communicate with machines through thought. Neuralink has faced scrutiny in the past regarding its animal testing practices, but this approval suggests the FDA is confident in the potential benefits of the technology for human patients.

The initial trials will focus on individuals with paralysis, with the goal of enabling them to control external devices like computers and smartphones using their brains. Neuralink hopes that the technology will eventually be used to treat a wide range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. While the approval is a positive sign, it is important to remember that this is just the first step in a long and complex process. The success of the trials will depend on the safety and effectiveness of the Neuralink device, as well as the ability of participants to adapt to and utilize the technology.

**Elon Musk's Neuralink Gets FDA Approval for Human Trials**

The company Neuralink, owned by Elon Musk and developing brain-computer interfaces, has been given the go-ahead by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to start its first trials involving humans. This marks a big achievement for the company, which wants to create devices that can be put inside the brain to help people with brain-related illnesses and, in the future, allow people to control machines with their thoughts. Neuralink has been criticised before about how it tests on animals, but this approval suggests the FDA believes the technology could really help human patients.

The first trials will involve people who are paralysed, with the aim of allowing them to control things like computers and smartphones using their brains. Neuralink hopes that the technology will eventually be used to treat many different brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Although the approval is good news, it's important to remember that this is only the beginning of a long and complicated process. The success of the trials will depend on how safe and effective the Neuralink device is, and also on how well the participants can get used to and use the technology.

**Researchers Develop Biodegradable Plastic from Fish Waste**

Scientists at a leading university have announced a breakthrough in sustainable materials science: a biodegradable plastic made from fish waste. This innovative material is derived from gelatin extracted from fish scales, skin, and bones, which are typically discarded by the fishing industry. The new plastic possesses similar properties to conventional plastics but decomposes naturally in a matter of weeks, significantly reducing its environmental impact.

The researchers believe that this biodegradable plastic could offer a viable alternative to traditional plastics in various applications, including packaging, agriculture, and biomedical engineering. Furthermore, it addresses the growing concern of plastic pollution and promotes a circular economy by transforming waste into a valuable resource. Further research is underway to improve the material's durability and scalability for mass production.

**Researchers Develop Biodegradable Plastic from Fish Waste**

Scientists at a top university have announced a major development in creating sustainable materials: a plastic that breaks down naturally, made from fish waste. This new material is created from gelatin taken from fish scales, skin, and bones, which are usually thrown away by the fishing industry. The plastic is similar to regular plastics but breaks down naturally within weeks, greatly reducing its impact on the environment.

The researchers think that this biodegradable plastic could be a good alternative to traditional plastics in different areas, such as packaging, farming, and medical engineering. It also helps to solve the increasing problem of plastic pollution and encourages a circular economy by turning waste into something useful. Further research is being done to make the material stronger and easier to produce on a large scale.
