            <h1>Zelenskyy says mercenaries from China and other countries are fighting for Russia; will take countermeasures</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that soldiers in Ukraine's northeast are fighting against "mercenaries" from several countries. These countries include China, Pakistan, and parts of Africa. He promised to take action against them.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Zelenskyy had said before that Russia was hiring Chinese people to fight in the war in Ukraine. China said this was not true. North Korea has also sent many soldiers to the Kursk region in Russia to help in the war.</p>
            <p>After visiting a front-line area in Kharkiv, a region in northeast Ukraine, Zelenskyy wrote on X (a social media platform): "We talked with our commanders about the situation on the front line. We also discussed how we are defending Vovchansk and how the battles are going."</p>
            <p>He also said: "Our soldiers in this area told us that mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries are part of this war. We will take action because of this."</p>
            <p>Reuters has asked the embassies of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, for their comments on this matter. Russia has not yet said anything publicly about what Zelenskyy said.</p>

            <h1>Boss of Ha Ji-won's agency stabbed to death in convenience store; prosecutors ask to keep suspect in jail</h1>
            <p>Zhan Zhineng, who was the general manager of the company for Korean cheerleader Ha Ji-won, was stabbed to death today. This happened in a convenience store in Fengyuan District. A man named Huang was involved. He was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office in the evening for the murder. After questioning Huang, the prosecutor asked the court to keep him in jail and also to stop him from talking to anyone.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office said that after talking to Mr. Huang, the prosecutor believes there is strong evidence that he committed murder. Murder is a very serious crime that can lead to more than five years in prison. The prosecutor thinks Mr. Huang might try to run away, talk to other people about the case, or destroy evidence. So, it is necessary to keep him in jail and stop him from communicating with others.</p>
            <p>The killing happened at 10:27 in the morning. A man was hurt with a sharp tool in a convenience store on Nanyang Road. Before he got to the hospital, he had no signs of life. He had many knife wounds on his hands and feet. Even after doctors tried to save him, he died from his serious injuries. The Fengyuan Police Station in Taichung asked the Taichung District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. In the afternoon, the prosecutor went back to the place where it happened. They also told Mr. Zhan's family to help with checking the body. To find out why Mr. Zhan died, a date has been set for a full examination of the body.</p>
            <p>After the police questioned Mr. Huang, they sent him to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office at 8:55 in the evening for more questions about the murder. Mr. Huang was still wearing his bloody clothes from the crime when he turned himself in. Because the clothes had blood on them and were evidence, Mr. Huang changed his clothes. Reporters asked him, "Why did you kill someone?" and "What big problem did you have?" Mr. Huang did not say anything. He sat in the police car, bending down in the back seat.</p>
