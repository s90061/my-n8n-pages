US President Trump announced new import taxes, called tariffs, for some countries today. These new taxes will start on August 1st. The Philippines will have a 20% tax, and Brunei and Moldova will have a 25% tax. Algeria, Iraq, and Libya will have a 30% tax on their goods sent to the US. So far, 20 countries have new tax rates, but Taiwan is not one of them.

President Trump first announced these tariffs in April. Then he paused them for 90 days, during which countries could talk with the US to get lower tax rates. This pause was supposed to end today but was moved to August 1st. Trump has already sent letters about new taxes to 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, which will pay 25% extra.

Trump's letters are almost the same for each country. They tell about the new taxes and warn that if countries tax US goods back, the US will tax them even more. But Trump also said that these tax rates could change depending on the relationship with each country. He also mentioned that if goods are sent through another country to avoid the tax, they will still be taxed. However, if companies build factories in the US, they won't pay this tax. Talks between Taiwan and the US about these taxes are still happening.

**European Stock Markets Stay Calm as Trump Threatens New Taxes on Copper and Medicine**

US President Donald Trump said he might put new taxes on copper and medicines coming into the United States. However, major stock markets in Europe did not react strongly to this news. They ended the day with small gains.

The FTSE 100 index in London went up a little, by 0.14%, ending at 8867.02 points. In Germany, the DAX index in Frankfurt rose more, by 1.42%, to 24549.56 points. The CAC 40 index in Paris also went up by 1.44%, reaching 7878.46 points. These numbers show that European markets were not worried by Trump's announcement.

**Demna Leaves Balenciaga After 10 Years to Lead Gucci**

Demna, a well-known designer from Georgia, is ending his 10 years as the main designer at Balenciaga today. His last fashion show will be during Paris's special fashion week. After this, he will start a new job as the main designer for Gucci, another famous brand.

During his time at Balenciaga, Demna was famous for his bold and sometimes debated designs. For example, he made bags that looked like an Ikea shopping bag or a trash bag, which cost a lot of money. He also faced criticism for an advertisement that many people thought was wrong. Despite this, many young famous people like Kim Kardashian and Charli XCX love his style.

Some people think Demna's modern and sometimes shocking style might not fit Gucci's more classic image. When the news came out in March that he would go to Gucci, the company that owns both Balenciaga and Gucci, called Kering SA, saw its stock price go down. However, Kering's boss said that Gucci needs Demna's creative ideas to improve.
