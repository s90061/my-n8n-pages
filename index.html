<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7321/8837519">https://udn.com/news/story/7321/8837519</a>

A 21-year-old man named Zhou Ziyun went to a dental clinic in Taipei last month. He claimed his teeth cleaning hurt too much and then hit the female dentist, Dr. Shen. The police found that Chen Zhongyi, the head of Earth Village, had asked Xia Weiteng, an important member of the Zhulian Gang's Jing'an Association, to deal with a debt of over ten million dollars. Yesterday, six people were arrested. After questioning, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office decided to hold Xia Weiteng and his helper Zhou Wenhan in custody without allowing visitors, as they might repeat their actions. Including Zhou Ziyun, three people are now in custody.

Xia Weiteng, also known as "Xia An," said that Chen Zhongyi did ask him to handle the debt, but he never threatened the female dentist. He said he only talked to her calmly about returning the mortgage documents. He also said he didn't know Zhou Ziyun and didn't tell him to hit the dentist, and he didn't know why she was attacked.

Dr. Shen said she loaned Chen Zhongyi 15 million dollars. But Chen Zhongyi didn't pay her back. Even after she won the lawsuit, he kept asking gang members to "discuss the debt." He said he would only pay back the money after getting the mortgage documents back, which she believes was a trick to avoid paying.

The investigation showed that Chen Zhongyi borrowed 15 million dollars from Dr. Shen and another man named Liu. Chen gave his house documents as security to Dr. Shen. In April this year, Chen asked Xia Weiteng to "handle" the return of the documents. Liu was also threatened because of this situation.

Police found that Xia Weiteng, Yan Daozhi, and Zhou Wenhan went to Dr. Shen's clinic to talk. They used their gang's name, which scared her. Because the talks didn't work out, they told Zhou Ziyun to pretend to get his teeth cleaned and then hit Dr. Shen.

On the day Dr. Shen was attacked, the clinic's air conditioning was being fixed, so she had no appointments in the morning. But Zhou Ziyun came in and insisted on seeing her. He saw a camera in front of the dental chair and kept asking to move to another spot. Luckily, Dr. Shen didn't move, so the camera recorded the attack. Because Dr. Shen was badly hurt, the prosecutors had already arrested Zhou Ziyun and kept him from having visitors. Today, the court also decided to keep Xia Weiteng and Zhou Wenhan in custody without visitors. So, three people are now in custody for this case.

**May 2025 Was the Second Hottest May Ever, Likely to Be One of the Top 5 Hottest Years**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8837512">https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8837512</a>

Taiwan's Central Weather Administration stated today that May 2025 was the second hottest May on record. This information comes from the latest global climate reports from Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The global average temperature in May was 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than before industrial times. The NCEI also said that 2025 is very likely to be one of the five hottest years ever, with a probability of over 99%.

In May, many places around the world experienced extremely high temperatures. On May 24, the United Arab Emirates had its hottest May day ever, reaching 51.6 degrees Celsius. Iceland had its worst May heatwave in history, with more than 90% of weather stations reporting new record high temperatures for May. France also had a severe heatwave in May. On May 30, the country's highest temperature reached 30.5 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest May on record. This was only the second time since 1947 that the temperature went above 30 degrees in May.

The Central Weather Administration also noted that the Arctic sea ice has been at or near its lowest levels since the beginning of this year. Although it went back up a little in April, it still reached the lowest level for May in the last five years. The ice is melting faster than usual. The situation for Antarctic sea ice is also serious, with some areas almost completely without ice.

The Weather Administration added that the world's oceans are experiencing "marine heatwaves," meaning they are unusually warm. This is causing big problems for ocean life and for the environment and economy along the coasts. It could also make climate change worse.

The Weather Administration pointed out that global warming continues to affect all parts of the world. The average global temperature from January to May 2025 was the second highest on record. The NCEI also said that there is a very high chance (more than 99%) that 2025 will be one of the five hottest years ever recorded.

**Guangzhou Jinan University Removed from Taiwan's List of Recognized Chinese Universities**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8837479">https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8837479</a>

Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of recognized universities and higher education institutions in mainland China. The list includes 154 universities and 191 colleges. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been removed from this list. After this change, there are still 154 universities and 191 colleges on the list.

Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao said at a university presidents' meeting earlier this year that schools linked to China's United Front Work Department are not truly academic institutions but serve specific political goals. He stated that it is necessary to stop working with them and that Taiwan will no longer recognize their degrees.

The Ministry of Education officially removed Guangzhou Jinan University from its list of recognized institutions. The Ministry explained that since 2019, Jinan University in mainland China has been managed by the United Front Work Department. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic environment, and because a learning place should not have specific political goals, Guangzhou Jinan University was taken off the list.

The Ministry of Education also said again that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, fair, and respectful. Schools that arrange exchange activities for students in China must follow Taiwan's policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of the activity, the organizers, the schedule, and any information provided. These activities should not have political aims or content. Schools should also avoid accepting free trips from China or helping with China's political plans.

Additionally, the Ministry said that if schools are unsure about the organizers or plans of an activity, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for help. The Ministry still hopes to help young people from both sides learn together and understand each other better. However, during exchanges, people should be aware of possible risks and check the background of the organizers and if there are any specific political aims.`;
