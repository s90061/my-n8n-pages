            <h1>Bora Pharmaceuticals' Half-Year Profit Reaches NT$19.5 Per Share Due to CDMO Growth</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals has shared its financial results for the first half of the year. The company's sales reached NT$9.347 billion. Its net profit, which is the money left after all costs are paid, was NT$2.016 billion. This is an increase of 11.9% compared to last year. The profit per share was NT$19.5, which means the company earned nearly two times its share value.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals stated today that its CDMO business has grown a lot. CDMO means "Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization." This business includes making products for other companies and also for Bora itself. In the first half of this year, this part of the business grew by 69.5% and made over NT$5.01 billion.</p>
            <p>However, there were some problems. The company's sterile injection factories in Maryland, USA, and Zhunan, Taiwan, had some delays in making products. This was due to changes in how things are put together after a business merger. This slowdown has improved in June, and the delayed orders will be completed soon. The company is confident about future orders and demand.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals is continuing to invest more in its CDMO business around the world. The factory in Canada recently added a new production line for skin medicines. This will help them make these medicines faster and in larger amounts. This new line will help the Canadian factory grow.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injection line at the Maryland factory in the USA is expected to start working fully in the third quarter of this year. Also, new automatic lines for sterile filling will start in 2026. In addition, the company's Maple Grove factory in Minnesota, USA, has made stronger, long-term partnerships with its clients. Many drug companies are now signing contracts because they want to make their products in the USA.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheng Baoxi, the chairman of Bora Pharmaceuticals, said that this year, the CDMO business has gained 8 new clients. Most of these new projects are handled by the Maple Grove factory in North America. New orders received this year are worth US$138 million. Most of these new orders are for the Canadian factory and the sterile product factories. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego factory (which became part of Bora after merging with TaiFu Biologics) has started working. The factory has also expanded its capacity to 2000 liters, which has attracted many US drug companies that are in the later stages of developing new medicines.</p>
