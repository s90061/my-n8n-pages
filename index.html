White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said today that people will know from the news this week which countries will receive tariff notices from the U.S. and which countries are willing to open their markets to American goods. The U.S. will place some tariffs on these countries. Both small and large trade partners will get these letters, and all countries know the general deadline.

Hassett explained on CBS's "Face the Nation" program that some agreements are in their final stages. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has been talking with many countries. The U.S. will send letters to several countries, telling them that their offers are not enough and what the U.S. thinks should happen. He also said that some countries will agree to open their markets to the U.S., and the U.S. will put some tariffs on their products. The exact numbers will also be in the news this week.

Hassett did not say which countries would reach a deal by the deadline, but he noted that the U.S. is always ready to talk with anyone about anything. There are deadlines, and some are coming soon. Some situations might cause delays. President Donald Trump will make the final decisions.

**Trump Says Musk's "America Party" is Absurd and Troublesome**

U.S. President Trump today strongly criticized former ally and billionaire Elon Musk's new political party, calling it "absurd." He said that Musk might have fun with his new plan, but the U.S. works best with a two-party system.

Musk announced the formation of the "America Party" after falling out with Trump. Trump told reporters, "I think starting a third party is absurd. The Republican Party has been very successful, and the Democratic Party has lost its way, but it has always been a two-party system. I think creating a third party just causes more trouble."

Trump signed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" into law on July 4th. Musk strongly opposed this bill, believing it would make the U.S. go bankrupt. In response, Musk announced the formation of his "America Party" yesterday.
