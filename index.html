            <h1>FamilyMart Opens Childcare Center with NT$15 Million Investment; Employees' Children Get Priority</h1>
            <p>FamilyMart's general manager, Hsueh Tung-tu, said on September 16th that the company will spend 15 million New Taiwan Dollars to open a childcare center. This center will be in the FamilyMart main office building in Taipei City. It will care for babies and young children from 0 to 2 years old. The center will open on September 22nd. Children of FamilyMart employees and their grandchildren will get to join first. The company is also applying to make it a "semi-public" childcare center. This way, they hope to help families who are not employees too.</p>
            <p>FamilyMart held a press conference about the childcare center today. Hsueh Tung-tu said that every year, FamilyMart asks its employees what they need. Childcare help and flexible work hours are the two most important things. More than half of the office staff are at an age where they might get married or have children. In the last three years, about 70 babies were born to employees each year. But for families where both parents work, or without family help, it is often hard to choose between caring for children and working.</p>
            <p>He said that to create a good workplace for families and to support employees in having children, FamilyMart decided to open its own childcare center. It took more than one year to plan, build, and register the center. It will officially start on September 22nd. The center can take 52 children. It has classrooms for different age groups and play areas. Employees can drop off and pick up their children easily when they go to and from work. The center will also offer late care until 7:30 PM.</p>
            <p>Hsueh Tung-tu also mentioned that the FamilyMart childcare center will apply to become a government-approved "semi-public" childcare center. This means that parents whose children live in Taipei City can apply for money from both the central government and the local government. For the first child, families in Taipei City can get up to 18,000 New Taiwan Dollars fully covered.</p>
            <p>Uni-President Superstore also said today that to create a friendly environment for raising children, they work with childcare places. They offer special prices for employees at childcare centers or kindergartens. This helps employees spend less money on childcare. Employees can also choose a center close to their home or work, which meets their personal needs.</p>
            <p>Uni-President Superstore also mentioned other benefits. They give money for children's education and scholarships. They also give small gifts to pregnant mothers and their partners, gifts for new babies, and money for births. They also have flexible work hours. They have a "Happiness Cooperative" to help with health and family issues. They hope to help employees have a good balance between family and work.</p>

            <h1>Joseph Wu Writes to Swedish Media: "Taiwan Works Together" to Help Global Peace and Prosperity</h1>
            <p>Joseph Wu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, wrote an article for a well-known Swedish newspaper called "Nya Wermlands-Tidningen." In his article, he asked people in Sweden to understand that China is wrongly using a United Nations resolution (number 2758). He said that Taiwan is on the front line of the "first island chain" in the Indo-Pacific area. There, Taiwan strongly supports democracy and freedom.</p>
            <p>The 80th "United Nations General Assembly" (UNGA) will start on September 9th at the UN headquarters in New York. The main discussions will happen from September 23rd to 27th and on September 29th.</p>
            <p>The article wants to tell people in Sweden that China is twisting UN Resolution 2758. Taiwan, on the "first island chain" in the Indo-Pacific, is defending democracy and freedom. Taiwan works with democratic countries through a "global democratic value chain." This helps keep international rules and order. Taiwan is also building a "non-red supply chain" to stop authoritarian countries from controlling important industries.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu's article was published in the famous Swedish newspaper "Nya Wermlands-Tidningen" (NWT) on September 12th. The title was "Let 'Taiwan work together' to help global peace and prosperity."</p>
            <p>In his article, Joseph Wu said that the world now faces many difficult problems and dangers. Countries that are not democratic are using tricky methods. This is putting international rules and order in danger. He said we should never think that peace will always be there.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is a key member and an important partner in the Indo-Pacific area. It is on the "first island chain" and protects democracy and freedom from authoritarian rule. Taiwan has a strong economy and a complete semiconductor industry. These help the world stay stable and grow.</p>
            <p>The article also said that Taiwan is the 21st largest economy in the world. It leads in artificial intelligence and semiconductor technology. Taiwan makes more than 60% of the world's computer chips and 90% of the advanced ones. This means Taiwan helps global growth and is a key partner in many areas of world development.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said that Taiwan wants to protect democratic values both at home and abroad. Through the "global democratic value chain," Taiwan makes its partnerships with democratic countries stronger. This helps them face difficult political risks together. It also helps them stop authoritarian influence, promote human rights, improve digital governance, and keep international rules.</p>
            <p>He said that Taiwan is like an "economic sun that never sets." It leads in semiconductors and advanced technology. This helps new ideas and growth in areas like artificial intelligence, digital technology, and healthcare. Taiwan uses an economic plan called the "non-red supply chain." This plan builds trusted and open industry networks. It stops authoritarian governments from taking control of important industries.</p>
            <p>The article said that even though Taiwan helps the world a lot, other countries do not always recognize it. Taiwan cannot join the United Nations. This unfair exclusion happens because China wrongly interprets UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. China also links this resolution to its "One China Principle." It uses this resolution to stop Taiwan from joining international groups.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said in his article that Resolution 2758 does not actually mention Taiwan. This resolution only talked about who represents China in the United Nations. It did not say that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China. It also did not give the People's Republic of China the right to represent Taiwan in the United Nations. However, the United Nations follows China's political pressure and keeps Taiwan out of international society.</p>
            <p>He said that Taiwan is speaking out in the world against this unfair treatment and asking for international support. More and more countries, in their talks and in groups like the "G7" summit, are saying that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important. Also, many governments and lawmakers in different countries have openly stated that UN Resolution 2758 did not decide Taiwan's status. It also did not stop Taiwan from joining international organizations, including those of the United Nations.</p>
            <p>At the end of his article, Joseph Wu asked for Taiwan to be included in the international community. He said it is a good time to do this, as the UN celebrates its 80th birthday. Also, there are only five years left to reach the UN's "2030 Sustainable Development Goals." Including Taiwan would help achieve the goal of "leaving no one behind" and "working together."</p>
            <p>"Nya Wermlands-Tidningen" started in 1837. It is the biggest morning newspaper in VÃ¤rmland Province in western Sweden. The newest Swedish media survey, Orvesto, shows that "Nya Wermlands-Tidningen" reaches about 161,000 people every day through its newspaper and website.</p>

            <p>Gogoro's board of directors announced today that a big shareholder has promised to invest more money. They will complete a new investment of 2.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars in 2026.

            <p>Samuel Yin, the head of the Ruentex Group, said in a press release that he has always believed in and supported Gogoro's dream of creating sustainable cities.

            <p>Gogoro's chairman, Horace Luke, said that the board will keep helping the team grow its business. They will focus on the Taiwan market and also share their battery exchange system with other countries. They plan to enter the Southeast Asian market, where electric vehicles have great potential.</p>
            <p>Gogoro board member Samuel Yin Jr. said that helping Taiwan achieve zero carbon emissions and making electric scooters more common are Gogoro's long-term goals. The board believes in the team's plans, direction, and skills. They fully support the team as it moves to the next level of growth.</p>
            <p>Gogoro CEO Kang Chia-wei said that the new investment will bring new types of vehicles and batteries to the market. They will also work on using batteries in different ways and creating energy storage solutions. And they will continue their plans in the Vietnam market.</p>
            <p>Gogoro explained that this year, their management team has improved the company's money situation and how it works. Gogoro continues to focus on several strategies. These include managing money carefully, reorganizing business, making product plans better, developing products faster, and making the company run more efficiently. They focus on giving long-term value to customers and the company. This builds a stronger base for future growth.</p>
            <p>Gogoro said that they recently shared their financial report for the second quarter of 2025. Their operating cash flow increased from 4.8 million US dollars in the first half of 2024 to 15.2 million US dollars in the first half of this year. Operating costs were about 11 million US dollars less than in the same period of 2024.</p>
