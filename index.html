            <h1>Taiwanese Students Organize Exhibition, Telling Indigenous Stories from Dutch Colonial Period</h1>
            <p>A group of Taiwanese students in the Netherlands has created an exhibition. It tells the less-known stories of how the Dutch East India Company and indigenous people interacted in Taiwan during the 17th century.</p>
            <p>Yang Er-wen organized the exhibition "Invisible Formosa: Interactions Between the 17th Century Dutch East India Company and Taiwanese Indigenous People." She recently finished studying environmental science at Wageningen University in the Netherlands in August. She started the "Invisible Formosa" team with five other students from the same university.</p>
            <p>Ms. Yang said in an email interview that she had visited indigenous villages. There, she heard interesting stories about the time when the Dutch ruled Taiwan. She thought about her history education in Taiwan. It mostly focused on Han Chinese stories. For example, during the Dutch and Spanish colonial periods, she only remembered one event about Kuo Huai-yi. She did not know that indigenous people and the Dutch had so many complex interactions.</p>
            <p>In 1652, Kuo Huai-yi was a leader of Han Chinese farmers in Taiwan. He led farmers who were poor and unhappy with Dutch rule. The Dutch used soldiers with guns and got help from indigenous people to fight back. Kuo Huai-yi failed and died.</p>
            <p>Ms. Yang said that when she came to the Netherlands, she found that her Dutch friends almost did not know that the Dutch had once ruled Taiwan. So, she decided to hold an exhibition at her university. It showed stories from the perspective of indigenous oral history, which was not taught in either Taiwanese or Dutch history education. People liked it, so she continued to take the exhibition to other cities in the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>Ms. Yang mentioned one story from an interviewer. It came from the Matai'an Amis tribe in eastern Taiwan. Many people thought the Dutch only stayed in southwestern Taiwan. But the Dutch also went to the east to look for gold. They had many interactions with the local indigenous people there.</p>
            <p>She said that a Dutch team looking for gold left a translator in Matai'an to learn the language. However, this translator was killed for an unknown reason. Later, the Dutch burned the Matai'an ancestral spirit house and hundreds of other homes. They also killed the chief in front of everyone. They then joined other nearby tribes to attack Matai'an. But the Matai'an people were good fighters, and they fought so well that the surrounding tribes no longer dared to help the Dutch.</p>
            <p>The exhibition opened on September 6th at the "NGO DEI" gallery in The Hague, Netherlands. It includes stories from the Amis, Sakizaya, Paiwan, Tsou, Rukai, and Siraya tribes. These stories, along with historical records, academic research, and videos, create a complete picture of Taiwan-Dutch history.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from the "Invisible Formosa" team, the exhibition started with a speech by Professor Leonard BlussÃ© van Oud Alblas, a retired honorary professor of history at Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>Professor BlussÃ© said that in the 17th century, Taiwan was a central place in the sea trade network of East Asia. It was also an important link for the Dutch East India Company to travel between China and Japan. He told a lively story about how the Dutch met Formosa. He also talked about how the Dutch brought Chinese workers to Taiwan, which changed the groups of people living there.</p>
            <p>After Professor BlussÃ©'s speech, three people who provided stories for the exhibition joined online. They shared what indigenous people are doing today to protect their culture and language. They also talked about how they fought to get their proper names recognized. They were Amid Olay Pakadodang from the Matai'an Amis tribe, Uma Tavalan from the Sinckan Siraya community, and Edgar L. Macapili, who wrote a book called "A Preliminary Study of Siraya Vocabulary."</p>
            <p>Chen Po-liang, the secretary of the political section at the Taipei Representative Office in the Netherlands, attended the event. He said that this exhibition is not just about the history of Taiwan and the Netherlands. It is also about building a bridge for future understanding between them. The stories in the exhibition show the deep connections they built over time and distance.</p>
            <p>The "Invisible Formosa" exhibition will be open from September 6th to 14th, 2025.</p>

This was their second win in a row.</p>
            <p>In the first inning, the Guardians scored first when Fan Kuo-chen hit a two-run home run. This was his second home run in two days and his 11th this season.

            <p>In the 6th inning, both teams scored 1 run. In the 7th inning, when the Guardians had runners on all bases, Lin Tse-pin also hit a triple. This brought in 3 more runs, making the score 9-1 for the Guardians. The Dragons tried to catch up in the 8th inning. Giljegiljaw Kungkuan hit a home run off Chang Jui-lin. Chen Tzu-hao got to first base by walking. Then, Liu Chi-hung, Liu Chun-wei, Chuan Hao-wei, and Wang Shun-ho all hit singles, scoring 3 more runs.</p>
            <p>However, the Guardians still beat the Dragons 9-5, getting their second win in a row. The Guardians hit 16 times in total during the game. Fan Kuo-chen hit 4 times out of 6 chances and brought in 3 runs. The Guardians' starting pitcher, Roenis ElÃ­as, threw 90 pitches for 6 innings. He only let 2 hits, 4 walks, and 4 strikeouts happen, and only gave up 1 run. He got his 7th win this season and was chosen as the Most Valuable Player for the game.</p>
            <p>The Dragons' starting pitcher, Zac Lowther, threw 95 pitches but only played for 4 innings. He allowed 8 hits, 5 walks, and 4 runs, and he lost the game.</p>
            <p>There was a small problem in the 3rd inning. Guardians pitcher ElÃ­as had to leave the field to change his shoes because they were too shiny. The Dragons' coaches complained about them.</p>

            <h1>Miaoli Police Accused of Protecting Gangs, Using Stand-ins for Shooting Case; 2 Squad Leaders Indicted</h1>
            <p>The Miaoli District Prosecutor's Office announced today that two police squad leaders have been charged. One is named Chang, and the other, Tseng, has retired. They are accused of helping a gang find other people to take the blame for a shooting. They also created fake official documents. Another detective, Cheng, will not be prosecuted for now if he follows certain rules.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli District Prosecutor's Office released news today. It said that in September 2022, there was a gang fight in Zhunan Township, Miaoli County. A man named Chang and another man named Wu first hurt each other with weapons. After that, Chang told his younger gang members to chase Wu's group in a car and shoot at them. Wu and others were injured by the gunshots. The Zhunan police then started looking for the people involved in the shooting.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that after getting information, squad leader Chang, retired squad leader Tseng, and detective Cheng went to Hsinchu City. There, the gang member Chang gave them the handgun used in the shooting. They agreed to only take two teenagers, Wang and Yin, as suspects. They would not investigate the real owner of the handgun, who was the gang member Chang.</p>
            <p>The three police officers drove the two teenagers to a parking lot near Shibajian Mountain in Hsinchu City. They filmed a fake video of searching for evidence and wrote untrue official reports. They were helping the gang find fake suspects to take the blame for the person who actually had the gun.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that after finishing the investigation, squad leader Chang was charged. His charges include making false official documents, breaking laws about guns and knives, corruption, and not being able to explain where his money came from. Prosecutors have asked the court to sentence him to at least 6 years in prison.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors also said that the retired squad leader Tseng was charged with making false official documents. Detective Cheng was given a special deal where he will not be prosecuted for 2 years. This is because he is new to the job and followed orders from his bosses. He must also pay NT$200,000 to the government to show he wants to change.</p>
            <p>The Zhunan Police Precinct in Miaoli County said in a written statement that squad leader Chang has been suspended from his job. Detective Cheng has been moved to a different work area. The police will also look carefully into the actions of other staff involved and hold them responsible.</p>
