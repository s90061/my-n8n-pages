            <h1>Swedish pole vault star Duplantis wins gold and sets new world record at World Athletics Championships</h1>
            <p>On September 15th, in Tokyo, Japan, the World Athletics Championships had its third day. Armand Duplantis, a famous pole vaulter from Sweden, won a gold medal in the men's pole vault. He jumped over 6.30 meters, setting a new world record.</p>
            <p>News agencies like Reuters reported that Duplantis had already won the gold medal after jumping over 6.15 meters. But he raised the bar by another 15 centimeters. On his third try, he successfully jumped over 6.30 meters. This broke his own world record of 6.29 meters, which he set last month in Budapest.</p>
            <p>Duplantis not only won the men's pole vault gold medal at the World Athletics Championships for the third time in a row, but he also broke the world record for the 14th time in his career. He also won gold medals in pole vaulting at the Olympic Games in Paris and Tokyo before.</p>
            <p>Emmanouil Karalis from Greece won the silver medal with a jump of 6 meters. Kurtis Marschall from Australia won the bronze medal with a jump of 5.95 meters.</p>

            <h1>China's trade representative: China and the US had open talks in Madrid about TikTok and other issues</h1>
            <p>Late on September 15th, Xinhua News Agency reported that Li Chenggang, China's international trade representative and vice minister of commerce, spoke after trade talks between the US and China in Madrid. He said the talks used the US-China trade discussion system well. Both sides had open, deep, and helpful talks about trade issues they both cared about, like TikTok. These talks were based on mutual respect and equal discussion.</p>
            <p>But this short report from Xinhua News Agency did not give details about what was discussed in the talks.</p>
            <p>The report said that Li Chenggang pointed out that for the past two days, both the US and China had meetings in Madrid, Spain. They actively worked to carry out the important agreements made during the phone call between the leaders of the two countries.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Reuters reported that Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, told the media after the US-China talks in Madrid that both sides had reached a basic agreement for the short video app TikTok. He said this agreement is for changing TikTok's ownership to be controlled by the US. Without this agreement, TikTok's operations in the US would not be extended.</p>
            <p>After the last extension, TikTok's operations in the US will end on September 17th.</p>
            <p>Also, US President Donald Trump said today that the US-China trade talks are going very well. He hinted that both sides have agreed on who will own TikTok. He also said that he will talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the 19th.</p>
