            <h1>US Tariffs Hurt Economy, Canada Stops Electric Car Rule</h1>
            <p>On September 5th, Canada announced new plans to become more competitive. This happened because tariffs from US President Trump greatly affected Canada's economy. These plans include stopping the rule for electric vehicles and starting a "Buy Canada" policy.</p>
            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that the government wants to make Canada's economy the strongest among the G7 countries. They plan to rely less on other countries. This will help Canada deal with global economic problems. He said, "When the world is uncertain, we are making Canada stronger from the inside. This will help our workers and businesses do well."</p>
            <p>One important part of the new plans is to stop the electric vehicle (EV) rule. This is because the car industry asked for it.</p>
            <p>In 2022, the Canadian government made a rule that 20% of all light cars sold in Canada had to be electric by 2026. The goal was 60% by 2030, and by 2035, all passenger cars sold in Canada had to be electric. This was to reach zero carbon emissions. Car makers or importers who did not meet these goals could be punished.</p>
            <p>After the US put new tariffs on Canadian car parts, the car industry criticized this EV rule. They said the goals were too difficult to reach, would cost more money, and could cause people to lose jobs. By June of this year, only about 8% of new cars sold in Canada were zero-emission cars.</p>
            <p>Now, Carney's government has announced they are stopping the 2026 goal of having 20% zero-emission light cars. They will also review the electric vehicle rule for 60 days.</p>
            <p>The "Buy Canada" policy is another main point. This policy means that the government will mostly buy from Canadian businesses and use Canadian products. They will also make a plan for provinces and cities to do the same. Ottawa plans to start parts of this plan by October this year and fully use it by spring 2026.</p>
            <p>Other plans include: a "Skills Retraining Program" to help 50,000 workers improve their skills with online job training. A "Strategic Response Fund" will invest 5 billion Canadian dollars (about 110 billion New Taiwan dollars) to help industries affected by tariffs. More money will go to canola farmers and businesses that are affected by high tariffs from China. They will also extend and increase business loan programs to help small and medium businesses with money problems. Finally, they will create a trade plan to sell more goods to countries other than the US. The goal is to increase these exports to 50% by 2030.</p>
            <p>Since February this year, when Trump put general tariffs on Canadian goods for border safety reasons, trade between Canada and the US has been difficult. Even though these tariffs later only applied to goods not covered by the "US-Mexico-Canada Agreement" (USMCA), the US still added more tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, copper, and cars.</p>
            <p>Currently, the US and Canada are still talking about trade tariffs. Trump and Carney had a detailed phone call recently. Carney said the talk "felt good," but this does not mean the US tariffs will disappear soon.</p>

            <h1>EU Fines Google 100 Billion After Trump's Warnings</h1>
            <p>On September 5th, the European Union announced a large anti-monopoly fine of 2.95 billion Euros (about 105.4 billion New Taiwan dollars) against the American tech company Google. They said Google gave special treatment to its own advertising services.</p>
            <p>Reporters said that the EU still decided to fine Google, even though US President Trump had warned them not to target big American tech companies.</p>
            <p>The European Commission said Google created unfair competition in the 27 EU member countries. Google quickly announced that it will appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>Teresa Ribera, who is in charge of competition in the EU, said, "Google used its powerful position in advertising technology in a bad way. This hurt publishers, advertisers, and customers. This kind of action is against the EU's anti-monopoly rules."</p>
            <p>Trump had said he would punish the EU if they tried to control big American tech companies. But after a few days, the EU still decided to give the fine. Earlier this week, there were reports that the EU's trade leader had stopped the fine for a short time because they were worried about the US getting back at them. This showed that the EU team had different ideas about the fine.</p>
            <p>The EU is still waiting for the US to keep its promise from July. In that promise, the US agreed to lower tariffs on European cars.</p>
            <p>Since 2021, the EU has been looking into Google's advertising technology business. In 2023, they suggested that Google should sell some of its advertising services to make the market fair again.</p>
            <p>Google, which is part of the American company Alphabet, believes that the European Commission's decision is "wrong." They say they will appeal.</p>
            <p>Lee-Anne Mulholland, who manages global rules for Google, said, "This decision gives an unfair fine. The changes they ask for will make it harder for thousands of European businesses to make money."</p>
            <p>Mulholland also said, "Providing services for people who buy and sell ads is not a monopoly. Today, there are many more choices and competition in the market than before."</p>

            <h1>European Stock Markets Fall Due to Poor US Job Data</h1>
            <p>On September 5th, European stock markets closed with lower prices. This happened because the United States released bad job numbers. This bad data made people think that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates this month. But it also made people worry about the future of the economy.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went down by 8.66 points, or 0.09%. It closed at 9208.21 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 173.35 points, or 0.73%. It closed at 23596.98 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 24.14 points, or 0.31%. It closed at 7674.78 points.</p>
