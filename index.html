Ericsson's latest report predicts that the number of global 5G users will exceed 2.9 billion by the end of 2025. This means about one-third of all mobile users will be on 5G. By the end of 2030, this number is expected to reach 6.3 billion.

The report also says that mobile internet traffic will double in the next five years. This growth is mainly due to new devices like AR (Augmented Reality) glasses and new AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications. From early 2024 to early 2025, mobile data traffic grew by 19%.

By the end of 2024, 35% of global mobile data traffic was carried by 5G networks. This is expected to go up to over 80% by the end of 2030. In Taiwan and Northeast Asia, 5G use is expected to reach 85% by 2030. The report highlights that AI applications are making smartphones more popular, and good network performance is key for these AI tools to work well.

**Train Passenger Argument, Suspect Tried to Show Knife; TRA Says Police Investigating**

Yesterday, on a Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) train (number 3247) heading to Xinying Station in Tainan, two male passengers started arguing. One older man seemed to try to take out a knife.

The train conductor was told about the argument in the fifth car. When the conductor arrived, one of the people involved had already left. The conductor gave the passenger who seemed to want to use a knife to the railway police in Tainan for investigation.

TRA reminds passengers that if there is a problem on the train, they should tell the conductor or call the customer service center. Bringing dangerous items onto trains without permission can result in a fine of NT$10,000 to NT$1,000,000.

**Over 60 Flight Attendants Report Parental Leave Affecting Pay Raises; Union Wants Quick Fines, EVA Air Seeks Legal Help**

The Taoyuan Flight Attendants Union protested today at the Taoyuan City Government. They complained that EVA Air flight attendants' salaries were not raised because they took parental leave. The union asked the labor bureau to quickly investigate and fine EVA Air if they broke the law. EVA Air said they will wait for the results of the official and legal processes to respond.

The union stated that most people who take parental leave are women, and if this affects their pay, it hurts women's salaries and discourages men from sharing family care, which can also lower birth rates. More than 60 flight attendants have complained about this issue, and previous complaints were found in their favor.

EVA Air stated that they treat all employees fairly. They adjust salaries based on how the company is doing, and on an employee's work performance and how long they have worked there. They said parental leave is not a special factor they consider for salary adjustments. EVA Air expressed regret that their appeal was rejected by the Ministry of Labor and plans to seek further legal action to protect the company's and employees' rights.
