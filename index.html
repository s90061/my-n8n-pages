            <h1>Ministry of Transportation Helps People Repair Homes</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and strong winds from the southwest caused heavy damage in southern Taiwan. Many people's homes were badly damaged. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said today that there is a shortage of workers and materials. So, they have gathered different departments to help connect people with companies. They hope this will help residents find workers to repair their homes.</p>
            <p>The MOTC stated on Facebook today that Vice Minister Chen Yan-po called a meeting yesterday with different departments. They checked the progress of repairs in the Tainan disaster area and planned what to do next. They have visited over 100 damaged homes. They are also looking for more workers and supplies to help people rebuild their homes quickly.</p>
            <p>The MOTC said that because there are not enough workers, materials, or machines, people cannot find workers for repairs. The government has asked all ministries to help. Each ministry is responsible for certain areas. The MOTC is responsible for Xinying District, Yanshui District, Baihe District, and Houbi District in Tainan City.</p>
            <p>People who want to repair their homes can first register with their district chief. The MOTC will then help connect them with companies. Residents will talk with the companies and sign a simple contract if they agree. The MOTC only helps connect them; it does not pay for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To make rebuilding faster, the MOTC also set rules for action. Besides connecting companies, they will first repair old single-story houses and homes with damaged roofs that cannot be lived in. They will also collect waste materials like asbestos tiles in one place. The district office will help remove them.</p>
