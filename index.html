Expansion plans, including increased battery production, are also expected to contribute to improved profitability.

Even though profits are lower, Tesla is still hopeful about the future. They pointed out that they made a record number of cars and that many people want to buy them. They believe they will grow more in the next few months as they improve how they make cars and solve the supply chain problems.

Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, said that the company is still focused on its long-term goals and on creating new electric vehicles.
