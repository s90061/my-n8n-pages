**China says Taiwan president spreading 'heresy' with sovereignty speech**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy," hostility, and provocation. This accusation came after his speech, where he stated that the island is "of course" a country, supported by historical and legal evidence.

Beijing asserts that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory, belonging to China since ancient times. They consider the island one of their provinces, without the right to be called a state.

President Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have offered to hold talks with China multiple times, but these offers have been rejected. China refers to Lai as a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, claimed that he deliberately twisted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

Their statement said, "It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that openly incited confrontation across the strait, and a mix of 'Taiwan independence' false beliefs and heresies full of mistakes and omissions."

It added, "The false ideas created by Lai Ching-te, which go against history, reality, and law, will only be discarded into the garbage of history."

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles China policy, stated that Lai was simply stating historical facts. They added that Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis."

They further stated, "We urge the Chinese communist authorities to acknowledge the objective existence of the Republic of China and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'."

In 1949, the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan after losing a civil war against Mao Zedong's communists, and this remains the island's official name.

Lai has consistently stated that only the people of Taiwan can decide their future, and since the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Over the past five years, Taiwan has faced increased military and political pressure from China, including military exercises.

**SEMICON Taiwan Upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week"**

<a href="https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/semicon-taiwan-%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8E%E9%AB%94%E5%91%A8-201000087.html">News Link</a>

The global semiconductor industry's annual event, "SEMICON Taiwan 2025," officially started on the 17th. Marking its 30th anniversary, SEMI, the International Semiconductor Industry Association, announced that the exhibition will be upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week." Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the US-China tech war, with Trump pressing allies to bring companies back with high tariffs, major manufacturers like TSMC face even greater pressure to invest in the US. In the future, semiconductor companies will be forced to "pick sides," and supply chains will accelerate regional reorganization. Semiconductors have shifted from being commercial goods to strategic assets, with decision-making moving from "market efficiency" to "national security resilience."

With "Leading with Collaboration. Innovating with the World." as the theme for SEMICON Taiwan 2025, this year marks the debut of International Semiconductor Week. Key international forums will be held on September 8th and 9th, followed by the exhibition from September 10th to 12th. Cao Shi-lun, SEMI Global Chief Marketing Officer and President of SEMI Taiwan, stated that in the first quarter of 2025, global semiconductor equipment shipments reached $32.05 billion, a 21% year-on-year increase, mainly driven by the growing demand for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and edge computing applications, showing strong growth momentum.

However, he also stated that the industry faces challenges like supply chain restructuring and geopolitical issues. The US government is using methods such as equipment embargoes (ASML), talent cut-offs (US experts), and supply chain decoupling, forcing companies to "pick a side." Semiconductor industry professionals believe that with accelerated regional reorganization of supply chains, they need to re-evaluate production and investment plans to deal with policy risks and geopolitical uncertainties.

Regarding ongoing semiconductor tariffs, relevant industry players noted that according to Section 232 of the Commerce Department's regulations, after the Commerce Secretary initiated an investigation on April 1st this year, a report must be submitted within 270 days, meaning it will be released by December 27th at the latest. The US President then has 90 days after receiving the report to make a decision, which means the semiconductor tariff deadline will fall around March 27th next year. However, the actual situation may vary due to political considerations or the complexity of the investigation.

Diversifying operations is the best approach. TSMC, as the leading wafer foundry, is increasing its investment in the US to meet customer demand. Industry players stated that geopolitical factors are driving supply chain independence, which helps support demand for semiconductor equipment. In addition, the demand from AI/HPC applications is driving the adoption of advanced manufacturing processes (GAA), the growth of HBM demand, and the development of advanced packaging technologies, which will also increase investment in semiconductor equipment.
