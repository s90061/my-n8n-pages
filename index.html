            <h1>Four Astronauts from US, Russia, Japan Go to Space Station to Practice Moon Landing</h1>
            <p>Today, NASA and SpaceX sent a team of four people to the International Space Station (ISS). They will start their newest research trip at this space lab.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that American astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian astronaut Oleg Platonov from Roscosmos, took off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 11:43 AM. They were on SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, which was on a Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
            <p>This Crew-11 mission is the eleventh time astronauts have gone to the ISS as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. This program works with private companies to continue space travel after the space shuttle era.</p>
            <p>During their six-month stay, the astronauts on the Crew-11 mission will pretend to land near the Moon's south pole. This is part of America's Artemis program.</p>
            <p>They will use small controllers and different screens to check how changes in gravity affect how astronauts can fly spacecraft, like future moon landers.</p>
            <p>The Crew-11 mission also brought pomegranate seeds from Armenia. These seeds will be compared to a group of seeds on Earth. This is to study how low gravity affects how plants grow.</p>
            <p>The International Space Station will stop working after 2030. Its orbit will slowly get lower until it breaks apart in the air above "Point Nemo" in the Pacific Ocean. Point Nemo is often called the spacecraft graveyard.</p>

            <h1>Man Held in Custody for New Taipei Box Body Case, Accused of Killing Family Member</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, New Taipei City, August 2) In the Zongjhuang box body case, a man named Chen was sent to the New Taipei Prosecutor's Office yesterday. He was accused of murder and leaving a body. After questioning, the prosecutor asked to keep him in custody and not let him see anyone. Late at night, the New Taipei District Court decided to hold Mr. Chen in custody and not let him see anyone. This was because he was suspected of killing a direct family member and leaving a body.</p>
            <p>Late at night on July 28, the Xinzhuang Police Station in New Taipei City received a report. A red suitcase was found in a ditch at the end of Xintai Road, Lane 381, Xinzhuang District. Inside was the body of a man who had been dead for many days. The police immediately formed a special team to investigate after the event.</p>
            <p>On August 1, the Xinzhuang Police Station said that they looked at security camera videos from the area. The "Hawk-Eye Team" checked videos from nearly 22 days. They found important pictures. The police believed that a man named Chen was a strong suspect. Mr. Chen was seen near the crime scene around July 6. He was suspected of leaving the body and running away.</p>
            <p>The police said they arrested Mr. Chen on July 31. Neighbors nearby said that Mr. Chen's father was about 70 years old. He had been missing for almost a month. He was thin, had trouble moving, and had thin hair. These details matched the dead man.</p>
            <p>The police said they sent the unclear fingerprints of the dead person to the Criminal Investigation Bureau again. They used a "manual method" to compare the fingerprints with existing records. This confirmed that the dead person was Mr. Chen's father. Also, after the body is examined, they will do DNA matching.</p>
            <p>The police said there were no clear injuries on the body. So, they need to find out if Mr. Chen killed the person or if he left the body for other reasons. It is understood that when the police asked questions, Mr. Chen sometimes gave answers that did not fit the questions, or his words were not clear. After the police interview yesterday afternoon, Mr. Chen was sent to the New Taipei Prosecutor's Office for murder and leaving a body.</p>
            <p>After questioning last night, the prosecutor believed that Mr. Chen was very likely to have killed a direct family member. They thought he might destroy evidence or run away. So, they asked the court to keep him in custody and not let him see anyone.</p>
            <p>Late last night, the New Taipei District Court said that after the judge questioned Mr. Chen, they believed he was very likely guilty of killing a direct family member and leaving a body. They also believed he might run away or destroy evidence. So, they decided to keep him in custody and not allow him to see or talk to anyone.</p>
