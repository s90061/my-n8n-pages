            <h1>Cheng Li-wen Becomes KMT Chairperson, Known as a Fighter</h1>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen, a former KMT legislator, started her political life as a student activist. She began in the DPP party, but later left it to join the KMT party. She has held many important positions in the government and the party. When she was young, she supported Taiwan's independence. However, in this election, she said, "I am Chinese." She was a surprising winner, known for her strong, fighting style. She won against other candidates, like former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin, and became the KMT chairperson. This was a big surprise in politics.</p>
            <p>The results for the KMT chairperson election are out. Former KMT legislator Cheng Li-wen won against other candidates, including former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin and KMT legislator Lo Chih-chiang. She is now the new KMT chairperson. She is also the second woman to become KMT chairperson by direct vote from party members, after former chairperson Hung Hsiu-chu.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen was born in Yunlin and grew up in Tainan. When she was studying law at National Taiwan University, she took part in the Wild Lily student movement. After college, she joined the DPP party. She worked for the DPP as a National Assembly member and the deputy director of the DPP Youth Department. But in 2002, the DPP stopped her membership because of her comments on the "Tu Hsing-che ear-licking case." So, Cheng Li-wen decided to leave the party.</p>
            <p>After leaving the DPP, Cheng Li-wen stayed out of public view for a while. On March 27, 2004, the Pan-Blue group gathered on Ketagalan Boulevard to protest unfair presidential election results. Cheng Li-wen hosted the event, which showed she was now officially supporting the Pan-Blue group. Later that year, she ran for legislator in Kaohsiung City but lost.</p>
            <p>However, Cheng Li-wen is a good speaker, a sharp host, and can explain ideas clearly. These skills were noticed by Lien Chan, who was the KMT chairperson at that time. In 2005, she was asked to join the KMT. After that, she became the KMT Culture and Communication Committee chairperson and a spokesperson. In the 2008 legislator election, the KMT chose her as a non-district legislator, and she won. But in 2012, she ran for a local legislator seat in Taichung City and lost to DPP legislator Ho Hsin-chun.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen was brave to run in difficult election areas. This built her image as a fighter, which is rare in the KMT party. After losing the legislator election, Premier Sean Chen asked her to be the Executive Yuan spokesperson. She was highly trusted by top leaders.</p>
            <p>In 2014, Cheng Li-wen left her job as Executive Yuan spokesperson. She then started working in media and hosted TV shows. In the 2020 legislator election, KMT chairperson Wu Den-yih chose her as a non-district legislator for the 10th Legislative Yuan. She won again and returned to the Legislative Yuan. After that, she became the KMT caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan.</p>
            <p>During the 10th Legislative Yuan session, the COVID-19 pandemic happened around the world. After Cheng Li-wen became the caucus whip, she became a strong voice for the party. She asked many tough questions and often stood at the front to argue for the party.</p>
            <p>In this KMT chairperson election, Cheng Li-wen was a surprising candidate. She actively visited local communities and showed a fighting image different from traditional KMT politicians. She received much support from military personnel, public servants, and teachers. Finally, she beat her rivals and became the party chairperson.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen successfully became the party chairperson. However, she did not come from the traditional KMT background. It will be a test to see if she can manage the KMT, which has a complex structure and strong local groups. She also needs to handle the competition and cooperation with the Taiwan People's Party carefully. All these things will show if she can help the KMT win the government again in 2028. The real challenge has just begun.</p>
