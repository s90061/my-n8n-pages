            <h1>China's Wingtech Semiconductor Subsidiary Frozen by Netherlands, US Restrictions Add Pressure</h1>
            <p>China's semiconductor company, Wingtech Technology, announced today that the Dutch government has frozen its control over its Dutch subsidiary, Nexperia, for one year. Nexperia was already affected by new export control rules from the US government.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology released a statement tonight about its Dutch subsidiary, Nexperia. It said the Dutch government froze Nexperia's global operations for "unproven national security reasons."</p>
            <p>Chinese finance news reported that Nexperia is important for Wingtech Technology's semiconductor business. It plays a key role in car semiconductors and special computer chips. It also works closely with top companies around the world in new energy cars, power grids, communication, and data products.</p>
            <p>Tech news website Bits&Chips reported on October 2nd that Nexperia was affected by new export control rules from the US government, announced in late September.</p>
            <p>The Dutch business newspaper NRC reported earlier that after the new US rules took effect, American companies cannot give controlled technology to Nexperia.</p>
            <p>At that time, Nexperia told the NRC that it had taken steps to keep its business running. It also said it would appeal, because these rules are "too wide and too strict."</p>
            <p>According to the updated US rules, if a company is at least 50% owned by a company on the US "Entity List," it will face the same export limits. This is true even if the two companies have different names.</p>
            <p>The US is making its trade blacklist wider. This change affects companies on the "Entity List." Companies on this list cannot get US goods and technology without government permission.</p>
            <p>The "Entity List" helps stop companies and other groups that are seen as a danger to US national security or foreign policy goals. Nexperia's parent company, Wingtech Technology, was put on this list by the US at the end of last year.</p>

            <h1>Magnitude 4.5 Earthquake Off Hualien Coast, Maximum Intensity 4</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 12 (Central News Agency) â€“ According to the latest information from the Central Weather Administration, a magnitude 4.5 earthquake happened at 11:12 PM on October 12th. The earthquake was 15.9 kilometers deep. Its center was 13.8 kilometers north-northeast of Hualien County Government, off the coast of Hualien County. The strongest shaking, or intensity, was level 4 in Hualien County.</p>

            <h1>China Tightens Rare Earth Exports, Impacting Global Market: Western Countries Strive for Self-Production</h1>
            <p>In recent years, Western countries have tried to grow their own rare earth industries. They want to rely less on China. But China recently announced that it will control rare earth exports more strictly. This still affects the world. Below is a look at how rare earth industries are growing in Australia, the US, Canada, and Europe.</p>
            <h2>Australia</h2>
            <p>Australia has the world's fourth largest amount of rare earth. It plans to make more. Last year, it produced 13,000 metric tons of rare earth.</p>
            <p>The Australian government has a plan called the "Critical Minerals Strategy 2023â€“2030." This plan helps grow the country's important mineral industry and increases its ability to process them.</p>
            <p>A famous rare earth project in Australia is the Nolans Project by Arafura Rare Earths. This project will build a mine, a processing plant, and other needed buildings in the Northern Territory. It might be one of the first places in Australia to turn rare earth minerals into rare earth oxides.</p>
            <p>Iluka Resources is building a new rare earth refining plant in Eneabba, a town on the west coast. It is expected to start working in 2027. The Australian government has given this project a loan of 1.65 billion Australian dollars.</p>
            <p>This year, the Australian Parliament also passed a law. It gives a 10% tax discount on costs for projects that process and refine 31 important minerals. This discount can last for up to 10 years.</p>
            <h2>United States</h2>
            <p>Last year, the US produced about 45,000 metric tons of rare earth. This was worth 260 million US dollars. The main mine is the Mountain Pass mine in California, owned by the US mining company MP Materials.</p>
            <p>The US government is actively supporting MP Materials. It uses investments, loans, tax breaks, and promises to buy products for a long time. This helps MP Materials make more processed rare earth and rare earth magnets. The Department of Defense has even become the biggest owner of MP Materials stock.</p>
            <p>In October this year, Australia's Lynas Rare Earths company and the American company Noveon Magnetics announced they would work together. They will supply rare earth permanent magnets to the US defense and business sectors.</p>
            <h2>Canada</h2>
            <p>Canada has one of the world's largest known amounts of rare earth metals and resources. In 2023, it was estimated to have over 15.2 million metric tons of rare earth oxide.</p>
            <p>The Canadian government recently launched a "Critical Minerals Strategy." In this plan, six minerals are listed as top priorities. They have special potential to help Canada's economy grow and are needed for important supply chains. Rare earth elements are among these six minerals.</p>
            <p>In August this year, Canada and Germany signed a statement. They agreed to work more closely on making sure critical minerals are available, on research, and on investing. This includes areas like making electric vehicles, defense, and aerospace.</p>
            <h2>Europe</h2>
            <p>The European Raw Materials Alliance was started in 2020 by the European Commission. Its goal is to find and fix problems with rules and find new chances. It helps Europe and the world create other ways to get rare earth minerals.</p>
            <p>A report from the European Raw Materials Alliance said that Europe has a lot of rare earth. But it does not have many large mining operations.</p>
            <p>According to the European Raw Materials Alliance, there are at least 14 rare earth projects in Europe. They have investments of 1.7 billion Euros. These projects will form the base of the European rare earth industry. They are expected to meet 20% of the EU's needs by 2030.</p>
            <p>A well-known European rare earth project is Pensana's rare earth refinery in Saltend, East Yorkshire, UK. Its goal is to meet 5% of the world's need for neodymium and praseodymium oxide.</p>
            <p>Also, France and Estonia have facilities to process rare earth.</p>
            <h2>What pollution does rare earth development cause? How can we reduce its environmental impact?</h2>
            <p>The rare earth industry causes a lot of pollution. From mining to processing, it harms the environment. It can destroy plants, cause soil to wash away, and unbalance natural systems. The processing also pollutes water and air.</p>
            <p>Because of this, many rich countries and regions like Europe, the US, and Japan have a lot of rare earth but often do not mine it. Instead, they choose to buy raw rare earth from China at lower prices.</p>
            <p>To reduce the harm the rare earth industry does to the environment, there are several things we can do. These include making mining and processing methods better, improving pollution control and environmental checks, and creating new ways to get rare earth elements more effectively from old electronics to use again.</p>
