            <h1>Zelenskyy Asks Trump for Peace Through Strength Before White House Meeting</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked US President Donald Trump to show "peace through strength" to Russia. He said this before an important meeting at the White House, using words similar to what Trump himself often says.</p>
            <p>Trump is soon going to meet with Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House. They will talk about how to end Russia's attack on Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Zelenskyy called the White House meeting "very serious." Before the meeting, he tried to flatter Trump by using Trump's famous idea of "peace through strength."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote on X (formerly Twitter): "Only strength can make Russia want peace. President Trump has this strength. We must take every right step to achieve peace."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that they will "have time to discuss the structure of security guarantees, which is truly the most important topic."</p>
            <p>This morning, many European leaders had a first meeting with Zelenskyy in Washington. Zelenskyy also met with Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters on his flight to Washington: "We must make sure we have peace, a lasting peace, and it must be fair and just."</p>
            <p>Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said before going to the White House that "a small window for talks is opening." She also supported the idea of security guarantees.</p>

            <h1>China Invites Putin to Military Parade, EU Envoys May Not Attend</h1>
            <p>The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong has learned that China will hold a large military parade next month. European diplomats in Beijing are talking about whether they should not go. This is because Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to be there, and Russian soldiers might also take part.</p>
            <p>The South China Morning Post reported that five people familiar with the situation said European Union diplomats in Beijing were invited to the parade and other events on the same day. However, Putin's presence worries them a lot, because Russia has increased its attacks on Ukrainian land.</p>
            <p>One of these people said that as the war in Ukraine continues, some European diplomats feel uncomfortable about "being in the same place as troops who invaded Ukraine." This is true even if it's not yet certain whether Russian soldiers will be in the parade.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin said in June that Putin would visit China from August 31 to September 3. He will take part in the military parade to remember the end of World War II and will also attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting.</p>
