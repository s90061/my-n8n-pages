Taiwanese businesspeople and companies in the Philippines are helping poor children go to school. They are giving out school bags and supplies. Public schools in the Philippines are free, but families still need to buy uniforms, shoes, and school items. This can be too expensive for many poor children, so they cannot attend school.

A group of Taiwanese businesspeople and a non-profit group called "Metro World Child" gave 300 new school bags and supplies to children in a poor area. A representative from the Taiwanese group said they love the Philippines and told the children to keep studying and help others when they grow up. Metro World Child has worked in this community for 25 years, helping children escape a life of drugs and poverty.

Also, China Airlines' branch in the Philippines gave 230 school bags, supplies, uniforms, and socks to children in another poor area. A local school principal said these donations are very helpful because most children come from very poor families and often walk without shoes.

**Han, Chu, Lu, Chiang Share Stage in Taipei to Support Li Yen-hsiu Against Recall**

In Taipei, important figures from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, including Chairman Chu Li-luan and Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu, came together. They were joined by Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen and Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an. They gathered to support KMT legislator Li Yen-hsiu, who is facing a recall vote.

Mayor Lu said that recalling a hard-working official like Li Yen-hsiu is a waste of NT$1.6 billion of public money, caused by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). She believes this money could be used to help the economy. She wore a "I disagree" T-shirt to show her opposition to the recall.

President Han said that this large recall effort is not true democracy, but "political murder." He warned that if it succeeds, it could damage Taiwan's democracy and lead to the DPP having too much power. Chairman Chu said that every legislative seat is important for the KMT and urged everyone to stand up and support their representatives.
