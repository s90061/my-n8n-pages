            <h1>US Considers Economic Help; Argentina Stock Market Rises</h1>
            <p>Today, the stock market in Argentina went up a lot. This happened after the US government said it was thinking about giving new financial help. This help is to support the difficult reform plans of Argentina's President Javier Milei.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced today that his department is looking into a new "system" for 20 billion US dollars. This money would help Argentina's struggling economy. Less than an hour after this news, some stocks on the Buenos Aires stock exchange's platform rose by almost 10%.</p>
            <p>This means that the total help the US President Donald Trump's government plans to give Argentina is 40 billion US dollars (about 1.2 trillion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Bessent told reporters in Washington, "We are preparing a 20 billion dollar system. It will work with our currency swap agreement. This money will come from private banks and national wealth funds. I believe this money will focus more on the bond market."</p>
            <p>Last week, Bessent announced that Washington was talking with Argentina about setting up a currency swap system. This would allow Argentina to use 20 billion US dollars. He also said that the US Treasury Department has started buying Argentine pesos in global markets to support Argentina's money.</p>

            <h1>ESPN: Westbrook Joins Kings, Will Play His 18th NBA Season</h1>
            <p>Sacramento (CNA News) â€“ Today, October 15, the agent for NBA star guard Russell Westbrook told the sports news company ESPN that Westbrook has agreed to sign with the Sacramento Kings. People close to the situation say he is expected to officially join the team later this week.</p>
            <p>ESPN reported that Westbrook kept in touch with the Kings during the off-season. He waited patiently in the free agent market. Finally, he reached an agreement with the Kings to play his 18th season in the NBA.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Westbrook has good relationships with Kings stars Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Zach LaVine, among others.</p>
            <p>Westbrook will turn 37 in November. He has been chosen for the NBA All-Star game 9 times in his career. He was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2017. He also holds the record for the most triple-doubles in NBA history, with 203.</p>
            <p>Also, Westbrook and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James are the only two players in NBA history to have at least 25,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, and 8,000 assists in their careers.</p>
            <p>Westbrook has scored a total of 26,205 points in his career. If he scores just 506 more points, he will pass the famous player Oscar Robertson. He would then become the highest-scoring point guard in NBA history.</p>
            <p>For total assists in the NBA, Westbrook is ranked 8th. He only needs 75 more assists to become the 8th player in league history to reach 10,000 career assists.</p>
            <p>Westbrook is an experienced NBA player. In the last three seasons, he played 216 games, starting 145 times as a substitute. In each of these seasons, he was in the top 10 for the Sixth Man of the Year award.</p>
            <p>Last season, Westbrook played 75 games for the Denver Nuggets, starting 36 of them. He averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.4 steals per game. His shooting percentage was 44.9%. In the 2024-25 season, his two-point shooting percentage was a high 52%, which is the best in his career for a single season.</p>
            <p>Westbrook joining the Kings will add much-needed players to their backcourt. This is because he can play both as a starter and as a substitute. Last season, the Kings' bench players ranked 28th in the league for points scored and 29th for assists. His experience might help the team play better.</p>

            <h1>China Limits Rare Earth Exports; US Treasury Secretary Calls Allies to Unite</h1>
            <p>Washington (CNA News) â€“ Today, October 15, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that China's limits on rare earth exports are "fighting against the world." He stated that Washington and its friends "will not be told what to do or controlled."</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Bessent told reporters today at a press conference, "This should be a clear message to our allies: we must stand together, and we will do so."</p>
            <p>He made these comments after global financial leaders met earlier this week in Washington for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank's autumn meetings.</p>
            <p>Bessent also asked for cooperation, saying, "We should work together to reduce risks and make our supply chains more diverse. We need to reduce our reliance on China as quickly as possible."</p>
            <p>On October 9, China's Ministry of Commerce announced rules to control the export of rare earths and related technologies. It also said that some logic chips, memory chips, and artificial intelligence (AI) with possible military uses would need special approval for each export.</p>
            <p>Because of this, US President Donald Trump threatened on October 10 to impose a 100% tariff (a tax on imported goods) as a response to Beijing's decision to limit rare earth minerals exports.</p>
            <p>China is the main producer of rare earths in the world. Rare earths are important materials used to make special magnets for industries like cars, electronics, and defense.</p>
            <p>Bessent said that Washington "would rather not" take possible opposing actions against China. He also said he expects more talks with Beijing this week.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Bessent also told the financial news channel CNBC that he is still "optimistic" about trade talks with Beijing. This is despite the recent increase in trade tension between the US and China over rare earth exports.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that both sides also held working-level discussions during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings.</p>
            <p>He also added that Trump still plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon.</p>
