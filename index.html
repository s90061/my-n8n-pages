            <h1>US Media: Only One of Three Iranian Nuclear Sites Destroyed by Air Strikes</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 17 (CNA) â€“ NBC News reported today, citing current and former US officials, that a new US report shows that only one of Iran's three nuclear sites was mostly destroyed during air strikes in June. The other two sites were not as badly damaged.</p>
            <p>The three nuclear sites attacked by the US military were Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.</p>
            <p>According to NBC, two current officials said that the attack on the Fordow nuclear site has stopped its ability to enrich uranium for up to two years. The US government believes this.</p>
            <p>The report also said that the other two nuclear sites that were attacked did not get as much damage. Their ability to enrich uranium only went down a little bit. Iran could start this work again in a few months if they want to.</p>
            <p>Reuters could not quickly check if NBC's report was true.</p>
            <p>Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the White House, told Reuters in an email that "Operation Midnight Hammer" has completely destroyed Iran's nuclear abilities. She said that the President also said this, and experts have agreed.</p>

            <h1>Zelensky: Ukraine May Sell Drones to US to Buy US Weapons; Talks with Trump Happening</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 17 (CNA) â€“ Ukraine's President Zelensky told the "New York Post" that he and US President Trump are thinking about a deal. In this deal, the US government would buy drones from Ukraine, and in return, Ukraine would buy weapons from the US.</p>
            <p>Zelensky said that his recent talks with Trump were about an agreement. This agreement would help both countries improve their flight technology.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ukrainian drones have been used in war. They can now fly up to 1300 kilometers into Russia and hit targets there.</p>
            <p>On July 16, Zelensky told the "New York Post," "Americans need this technology. You need to have it in your collection of military items."</p>
            <p>Zelensky said that drones are a very important weapon. They have helped Ukraine fight against Russia's invasion for more than three years.</p>
            <p>Zelensky said, "We are ready to share this experience with the United States and other countries in Europe." He added that Ukraine is also talking about this with Denmark, Norway, and Germany.</p>
