            <h1>Nanya Technology and Etron Form NT$500 Million Joint Venture for AI Memory</h1>
            <p>Nanya Technology, a memory chip company, announced today that it has formed a joint venture with Etron Technology to create a semiconductor design company. Nanya Technology can invest up to 40 million shares, with a maximum investment of NT$400 million, and own up to 80% of the company.</p>
            <p>Nanya Technology stated that the goal of this joint venture is to quickly develop custom high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and expand into the artificial intelligence (AI) market.</p>
            <p>Etron also announced that its company and its subsidiary, Ardentec Design, have signed a joint venture agreement with Nanya Technology. Ardentec Design and Nanya Technology will invest NT$500 million in the new company, with a share ratio of 20:80.</p>
            <p>Etron explained that the joint venture with Nanya Technology aims to meet the fast growth of the new AI edge computing market. It will provide valuable, high-performance, and low-power custom high-bandwidth memory solutions to expand various applications in AI edge computing.</p>
            <p>Etron believes that providing custom high-bandwidth memory solutions through the joint venture company will be good for its shareholders.</p>
            <p>Nanya Technology said in an investor meeting in early July that AI-related high-bandwidth memory products began to increase in price in 2024. The non-AI application market makes up about 90% of the total memory market. In June this year, the market reached a balance between supply and demand and prices started to rise. They expect prices to continue rising in the second half of the year.</p>

            <h1>EU Monitor: Global July Was 3rd Hottest on Record</h1>
            <p>Scientists from the European Union's climate monitoring group, Copernicus Climate Change Service, said today that July this year was the third hottest July ever recorded globally. During this month, Turkey experienced a high temperature of 50.5 degrees Celsius, which was the highest temperature ever measured in the country.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that even though record global temperatures had a short break, July this year still continued the trend of extreme weather. Scientists say this is due to global warming caused by humans.</p>
            <p>According to the European Union's (EU) climate monitoring group, Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the average global surface air temperature in July this year was 16.68 degrees Celsius. This is 0.45 degrees Celsius higher than the average for the same period from 1991 to 2020.</p>
            <p>Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus Climate Change Service, said: "As things stand, the recent series of global temperature records has paused after July of the year before last became the hottest July on record. But this does not mean that climate change has stopped. In July, we still saw the effects of global warming, such as extreme heat and floods."</p>
            <p>Even though July this year was not as hot as the hottest and second hottest Julys (the year before last and last year), the average global surface temperature was still 1.25 degrees Celsius higher than in 1850-1900. This was the time before the industrial period when humans started burning a lot of fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels creates greenhouse gases, which are the main cause of climate change.</p>
            <p>Also, in the 12 months from August 2024 to July 2025, the average global temperature was 1.53 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels. This has gone beyond the 1.5-degree Celsius warming limit set by the Paris Agreement. This agreement started in 2016 and aims to stop global warming. Last year was the hottest year ever recorded globally.</p>
            <p>Currently, the global temperature increase has not officially gone over the 1.5-degree Celsius limit. This limit refers to the average global temperature over many decades. But some scientists believe that it is no longer possible to keep global warming below this level. They are asking governments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions faster to lower how much the temperature goes over the limit and to stop more extreme weather events.</p>
            <p>Copernicus Climate Change Service has been recording temperatures since 1940 and compares them with global data that goes back to 1850.</p>

            <h1>Business Federation Asks if Giving Money to People Can Help Economy Amid Tariff Worries</h1>
            <p>The United States started its temporary 20% tariff on Taiwan goods today, August 7th, US Eastern time. Hsu Shu-po, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, said today that he hopes the government will work to lower Taiwan's tariff rate to be the same as Japan and South Korea. He also said that the challenge of the US equal tariff might hurt economic growth, so we need to think about whether giving money to everyone can boost local spending and help Taiwan's economy become stable again.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-po spoke before the 7th Brand Golden Sail Awards ceremony today. He said that President Lai Ching-te and his team have already stated that the 20% tariff is temporary. He believes the government is working hard to lower the tariffs. Businesses also hope Taiwan's tariffs can be reduced to the same level as Japan, South Korea, and the EU. This would truly help Taiwanese industries. If the tariffs are not lowered, traditional industries might lose about 3% to 9% in sales. They could also face problems like losing orders and people losing their jobs.</p>
            <p>When asked if the progress of Taiwan-US talks should be made public, Hsu Shu-po said that Japan and South Korea have both faced issues with opening up their agricultural markets. Taiwan might also have to open up some of its agricultural markets. But more importantly, the talks must also consider food safety. He also hopes the government will tell people and industries how the tariffs will affect them, to reduce the impact.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-po pointed out that the US equal tariff affects the fastener industry the most. This is because over 40% of fastener sales to the US. Car parts, plastic products, and plumbing hardware are also affected. The government should talk more with businesses and help industries deal with this. This includes keeping exchange rates stable, helping businesses sell to markets in Southeast Asia and Europe, and inviting international buyers to Taiwan. At the same time, he hopes the government will see the business community as strong support when negotiating with other countries, combining everyone's strength.</p>
            <p>US President Trump announced a 100% tariff on semiconductors imported into the US, but companies that have factories or are building factories in the US can avoid this tariff. Hsu Shu-po said that the 100% semiconductor tariff will not affect Taiwanese companies like TSMC much, because companies that have invested or have plans to cooperate in the US can avoid it. The stock market also went up a lot today. However, the effect of the tariffs on small and medium-sized companies still needs to be watched.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-po said that if the 20% equal tariff is not lowered, there might be job losses in the short term. However, the exact situation will depend on how much each company can handle. He believes that the President and the Executive Yuan team will do everything they can to negotiate Taiwan's tariffs down to the same level as Japan, South Korea, and the EU, so that Taiwanese companies can compete internationally.</p>
            <p>In addition, people are paying attention to the idea of giving NT$10,000 to everyone. Hsu Shu-po said that the Legislative Yuan has already passed a special law for this. Now, Taiwan is facing challenges like the US 20% equal tariff, which might cause economic growth to slow down. So, it needs to be considered whether giving NT$10,000 can boost local spending and help Taiwan's economy become stable again.</p>
