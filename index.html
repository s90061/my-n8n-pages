            <h1>New Taipei Fisherman's Wharf Fireworks Show Attracts Nearly 60,000 People</h1>
            <p>The "Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf Midsummer Fun" event series in New Taipei City started tonight with a beautiful fireworks show. Nearly 60,000 people came to watch. Deputy Mayor Liu He-ran said that there will be more fireworks shows on August 17th and 24th, and he hopes people will not miss them.</p>
            <p>Liu He-ran said that New Taipei City has 28 fishing ports. Since 2019, the city government has been working on the "Hi Fishing Port" plan. This plan changes fishing ports based on what they are used for and their special local features. The goal is to make fishing ports useful for tourism and other different things. So far, 22 fishing ports have been changed, and all of them are expected to be changed by next year.</p>
            <p>Because the Danjiang Bridge will be finished soon, this year's "Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf Midsummer Fun" event is bigger than before. It started tonight with the fireworks show. There will also be fireworks shows on August 17th and 24th. During the event, there will also be fashion art shows, student art displays, and folk song concerts. This will make the fishing port a place for entertainment, relaxation, modern art, and old memories.</p>
            <p>After that, the first fireworks show, called "Eternal Love Song," started with bright colors. It mainly used pink and rose-red colors to create a romantic feeling. People watching were very surprised and happy.</p>
            <p>The Fisheries Department said that this year's fireworks are bigger and more amazing than before. The show has three parts: "Almost Lovers," "Sweet Love," and "Vows of Happiness." The fireworks go from the ground up to the sky, creating many romantic visual layers. This gives a stunning view over the Tamsui River and a feeling of full happiness and love. Nearly 60,000 people came to the fishing port to watch the fireworks.</p>

            <h1>KMT Legislator Says President Giving Water is Like Feeding Deer in Nara; DPP Legislator Calls it Malicious</h1>
            <p>News reports say that Lin Pei-xiang, a legislator from the KMT party, said on a TV show that President Lai Ching-te giving drinks to workers looked like feeding deer in Nara. Guo Kuo-wen, a legislator from the DPP party, said today that the President's visit to the houses lasted more than an hour. But Lin Pei-xiang only used one picture, leaving out the beginning and end, and joked that it was "feeding deer in Nara." Guo said this was meant to mislead people.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, President Lai visited the disaster relief center in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan areas. He also went to places like Jiali to check on damaged houses that were being repaired. News reports said that Lin Pei-xiang commented on a CTI TV show today that the President giving drinks to workers looked like feeding deer in Nara.</p>
            <p>Guo Kuo-wen said that President Lai's visit to the houses lasted over an hour. But Lin Pei-xiang only showed one picture, leaving out the context, and made a joke about "feeding deer in Nara." Guo said this was a bad way to influence public opinion. He said it's okay to talk about current events, but this kind of comment shows a high and mighty attitude towards hard-working construction workers. He added that this explains why Lin was criticized before for being "marginalizing" people.</p>
            <p>Lin Chun-hsien, a legislator from the DPP party, said that yesterday, President Lai visited and cared about the repairs of two houses. He also brought sports drinks to comfort the workers. After checking the sites, President Lai walked around the area and gave sports drinks to people on the street and to the construction workers at nearby sites. He cared for the people affected by the disaster and thanked the construction teams for working hard on their day off.</p>
            <p>Lin Chun-hsien said that central and southern Taiwan were hit badly by a typhoon and then by several heavy rain systems. When facing a disaster, the most important thing is to work together to get through the difficulties. He pointed out that comments about current events must be based on facts. Political arguments do not help with disaster recovery, and disasters should not be used for political gain.</p>
