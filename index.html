            <h1>US Officials Raid Hyundai Car Factory, Detain 450 People Including Koreans</h1>
            <p>Today, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said that US police and immigration officers raided a Hyundai car factory in Georgia. They held up to 450 foreign people who were living in the country without permission.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that some news had said earlier that this factory was a place built together by LG Energy Solution, a battery maker, and Hyundai Motor. During the raid, US immigration officers held some South Korean people there.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Justice's Atlanta office announced the raid on X, a social media platform. LG Energy Solution did not want to say anything about it. Hyundai Motor has not answered yet.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that on September 4th, US immigration officers raided a large electric car factory of Hyundai in southeast Georgia. They also closed a nearby building site for an electric car battery factory.</p>
            <p>Lindsay Williams, a spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said that federal officers worked at the 1,214-hectare factory area west of Savannah. He said the officers mainly focused on the battery factory building site.</p>
            <p>Georgia Highway Patrol closed the roads to the Hyundai factory area. The Georgia Department of Public Safety said in a statement that highway patrol officers were sent to help federal officers.</p>
            <p>Videos on social media showed workers in yellow safety vests standing in a line. A man wearing a mask and a vest with "Homeland Security Investigations" (HSI) written on it spoke to them. He said, "We are Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole place."</p>
            <p>He said, "We need to stop all building work now. All work on the site must stop immediately."</p>
            <p>President Trump's government started many ICE operations to send many people back to their home countries. Immigration officers have raided farms, building sites, restaurants, and car repair shops.</p>

            <h1>US and Japan Exchange Trade Agreement Documents, Also Include Investment Profit Sharing</h1>
            <p>Japanese official Akazawa Ryosei visited the US starting on the 4th to talk about tariffs. During his visit, Japan and the US exchanged two documents. One document wrote down their agreement from July. The other was a note about Japan's investment in the US, which included how investment profits would be shared.</p>
            <p>NHK, a Japanese TV channel, reported that the first document was a "joint statement" that wrote down what both sides agreed on July 22nd.</p>
            <p>The statement said that Japan will buy 75% more US rice within its "Minimum Access (MA)" limit. It will also buy US farm products like soybeans, corn, fertilizers, and biofuel ethanol worth 8 billion US dollars (about 246 billion New Taiwan Dollars) each year.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that Japan will buy US energy products, including liquid natural gas, steadily for a long time. This will be worth 7 billion US dollars (about 216 billion New Taiwan Dollars) each year. Japan might also buy liquid natural gas from Alaska, USA, in the future.</p>
            <p>Also, the statement mentioned that Japan will buy 100 Boeing airplanes from the US. According to Japan's official "Defense Force Development Plan," Japan will buy more US-made defense equipment and computer chips worth billions of US dollars each year. Also, US-made cars that have passed US safety checks can be sold in Japan without extra tests.</p>
            <p>The second document was a "Memorandum of Understanding" about Japan's investment in the US. In late July, when Japan and the US talked about tariffs, Japan promised to invest 550 billion US dollars in the US.</p>
            <p>This note said that Japan believes investing 550 billion US dollars in the US is best for its economy and national safety (defense). This investment will be in areas like computer chips, medicines, important minerals, shipbuilding and energy, and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>An investment committee led by the US Secretary of Commerce will suggest where to invest. Then, the US President will make the final decision.</p>
            <p>The investments will happen at any time during US President Donald Trump's term, which ends before January 19, 2029. If Japan honestly follows the note, the US will not raise the agreed tariff rates.</p>
            <p>According to this note, profits from these investments will first be shared equally, 50-50, up to a certain amount. After that, 90% will go to the US and 10% to Japan.</p>
            <p>The White House announced today that President Trump signed an order based on the agreement with Japan. This order lowers the tariff on Japanese cars from 25% to 15%. It also makes Japan a country that gets equal tariff reductions, meaning the 15% tariff will not be added on top of other fees.</p>
            <p>Akazawa Ryosei, the Minister in charge of Economic Revitalization, who represented the Japanese government in tariff talks with the US, signed a "Memorandum of Understanding" today with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. This note was about the 550 billion US dollars investment in the US that both sides had agreed on before.</p>
