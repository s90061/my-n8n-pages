            <h1>Trump and UK Prime Minister Hold Press Conference, Discuss TikTok Call with Xi Jinping</h1>
            <p>Today, former US President Donald Trump confirmed that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping tomorrow, September 19th. They will discuss changing the ownership of the popular short video app TikTok.</p>
            <p>Trump has often delayed a law that would stop people from using TikTok. This law wants to make its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sell TikTok because of worries about national security.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Trump announced that a deal was made and said he would talk to Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>Trump is currently visiting the UK. Today, he held a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. At the event, he said, "We will talk to President Xi on the 19th. We want to see if we can finish something about TikTok, because it is very valuable."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that he believes TikTok helped him become more popular with young voters, which helped him win the 2024 election.</p>

            <h1>International Oil Prices Go Down as Concerns About US Economy Remain, Despite Interest Rate Cut</h1>
            <p>Today, international oil prices went down. This happened because investors are still worried about the future of the American economy. This is even after the US central bank, called the Federal Reserve (Fed), cut interest rates for the first time this year yesterday.</p>
            <p>Brent crude oil futures dropped by 51 cents, which is 0.8%. The price ended at $67.44 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell by 48 cents, or 0.8%. Its price finished at $63.57 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>UN Security Council to Vote on New Sanctions Against Iran's Nuclear Program</h1>
            <p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) will vote tomorrow. This month's head of the UNSC said that the UK, France, and Germany have suggested bringing back sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. The vote will decide if these sanctions will restart.</p>
            <p>In 2015, the US, UK, France, Germany, and other countries made a deal with Iran. It was called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the "Iran nuclear deal." This agreement strictly limited Iran's nuclear work, and in return, some sanctions against Iran were removed.</p>
            <p>This important Iran nuclear deal has now stopped working. This is mainly because the United States left the agreement alone in 2018, during Donald Trump's first time as president. After that, the US brought back sanctions on Iran.</p>
            <p>Now, France, the UK, and Germany have told the UNSC that Iran has broken the 2015 deal. They say Iran has not kept its promises to limit its nuclear weapons development. For example, its amount of enriched uranium is now more than 40 times what the deal allowed. Because of this, they want to change the current situation and bring back sanctions on Iran.</p>
            <p>Sources in diplomacy say that to keep things as they are (meaning to continue removing sanctions on Iran), 9 countries need to vote for it. But it is expected that this number will not be reached. So, sanctions on Iran are likely to start again.</p>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview that he expects international sanctions on Iran to start again by the end of this month at the latest. Macron's comments were shown on Israeli TV today.</p>
            <p>Important Western countries and Israel have often said that Iran is trying to make nuclear weapons. However, Iran says this is not true.</p>
