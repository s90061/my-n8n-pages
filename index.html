            <h1>New Taipei City Air Defense Drill on July 17: Stop Cars, People Find Shelter</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Zhao Minya, New Taipei, July 16) Northern Taiwan will have an air defense drill tomorrow afternoon from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM. New Taipei City's Department of Transportation announced that the whole city will practice "stop cars, people find shelter" for air defense evacuation. People who take the same bus after the drill finishes do not need to swipe their card when getting off during the drill.</p>
            <p>New Taipei City's Department of Transportation said in a press release today that during the air defense drill, buses and New Buses will stop their service. Vehicles that are moving should stop by the side of the road or near a bus stop. Drivers and passengers on the vehicles should follow the police or civil defense officers to evacuate and find shelter.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation reminded passengers that if they want to get back on the original bus after the drill, they do not need to swipe their card when getting off during the drill. This will prevent them from being charged extra. If they do not wish to get back on the original bus, they must swipe their card when getting off during the drill to avoid affecting future transfer discounts.</p>
            <p>For YouBike public bicycles, the borrowing service will be stopped during the drill, but people can still return bikes. After "Blue Highway" boats dock, passengers and pier staff must follow the police or civil defense officers to evacuate and find shelter.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation said that High-Speed Rail, Taiwan Railways, MRT, and highways will operate as usual. Travelers leaving stations and vehicles leaving highway exits need to follow air defense shelter rules.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation advised citizens that if they hear an air raid siren and are walking outdoors, they should immediately go into an underground space or an air defense shelter nearby. Vehicles that are moving should pull over and follow directions until the drill ends.</p>
            <p>New Taipei Metro Corporation stated that all New Taipei Metro lines and stations will continue to operate normally. During the drill, passengers arriving at stations should follow the instructions of the drill staff to find shelter. At circular line stations or elevated light rail stations, passengers can find shelter inside the station as instructed. If it is a ground-level light rail station, passengers need to follow police guidance to a specific shelter location. Also, during the drill, all transfer parking lots will allow vehicles to enter but not exit.</p>
            <p>New Taipei City Police Department said that when the air raid siren sounds, the air threat warning system will start. It will send a national alert text message to citizens. The message will include a "link for air defense shelter navigation" to help people go to the nearest shelter.</p>
            <p>In addition, New Taipei City Police Department shared that the iPolice APP's home page has an "Air Defense Shelter Area." It includes a map of all shelters in the city, information on how many people each can hold, and a one-click navigation function. This can help citizens quickly find and go to a suitable shelter.</p>

            <h1>Installing Video Cameras in Airplane Cockpits: IATA Leader Says It Helps Investigate Accidents</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Singapore, July 16, combined foreign reports) Willie Walsh, who leads the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said today that putting video cameras in airplane cockpits to help investigate accidents is a "strong idea."</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Walsh made these comments after the first report on an Air India plane crash last month was released. This report said that the plane's engine fuel switch had been turned off.</p>
            <p>The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) of India released its first report on July 12. The report did not give a final decision or say who was responsible. But it mentioned that one pilot asked another pilot why the fuel was cut off, and the second pilot said he did not do it.</p>
            <p>This accident happened on June 12. 241 people on the plane died, and only 1 person survived. Also, 19 people on the ground died.</p>
            <p>Walsh used to be a pilot for a commercial airline. He said he understands why pilots might not want video cameras in the cockpit. "This topic has not been talked about within IATA yet. But from my personal view, I believe there is a strong reason to put video cameras in the cockpit to help accident investigations. If we have video records plus voice records, it will likely help investigators a lot to find out why accidents happen."</p>
            <p>When asked if IATA would suggest changing the cockpit design to stop engine fuel switches from being turned off by mistake, Walsh said IATA will wait for a more detailed report and will not guess.</p>
            <p>Walsh said, "I think it is important that we let accident investigators do a full and proper investigation. We should wait for them to release their report, and then deal with the issues at that time."</p>
            <p>However, he also praised this first report, saying that it "had more information than most people expected."</p>

            <h1>To Deal with US Tariffs: Ministry of Economic Affairs Helps Industries like Machinery and Plumbing Find Buyers</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Liu Chian-ling, Taipei, July 16) To help businesses deal with the impact of US tariffs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said it will invite more buyers from all over the world to Taiwan for talks. In the second half of this year, it will help match buyers with industries that are more affected by tariffs, such as machinery, metal products, plumbing hardware, hand tools, and fasteners. At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to open a Taiwan Trade and Investment Center in the US in the second half of this year. This center will offer businesses complete services for their investments.</p>
            <p>The Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan will hold a public hearing tomorrow. It will be about "Taiwan-US Government Equal Tariff Negotiations and Our Government's Response." The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, along with other related government bodies, are invited to attend.</p>
            <p>According to a written report from the Ministry of Economic Affairs today, Taiwan and the United States are still talking. Based on an order signed by US President Trump on July 7, Taiwan will still have a 10% tariff rate before August 1.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that it will follow the rules of protecting the country's and industries' interests. It will work hard to make trade between Taiwan and the US more balanced and improve trade systems between both sides. This will create many different kinds of partnerships in trade and technology between Taiwan and the US in the future.</p>
            <p>To help businesses deal with the tariff impact, the Executive Yuan has started a "Taiwan Export Supply Chain Support Plan to Respond to US Tariffs." The Ministry of Economic Affairs said it will spend NT$46 billion. This money will provide businesses with funds they need for operations, such as better guarantees for export loans, and interest subsidies for small and medium-sized businesses for working capital or buying new machines. It will also help companies set up new display centers and warehouses overseas and support them in changing their research and development and replacing old equipment.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry of Economic Affairs launched the "Global Business Opportunities Linking Mobilization" plan. This plan will bring more global buyers to Taiwan for business talks. Following the success of the "TAIWAN SELECT Global Order-Winning Conference" in April this year, in the second half of the year, the ministry will help businesses in industries hit hard by tariffs, such as machinery, metal products, plumbing hardware, hand tools, and fasteners, to find suitable buyers.</p>
            <p>To help companies expand globally, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said it will continue to lead Taiwanese businesses to explore global markets. It will focus on trade partners in Central and Eastern Europe, Japan, the United States, and the Philippines. Currently, "Taiwan Trade and Investment Centers" have been set up in the Czech Republic and Japan. There are also plans to set up a center in the US in the second half of this year. These centers will offer businesses complete services for their investments.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs stressed that it will keep watching changes in global trade, like US tariff policies. It will listen to the needs and problems of all kinds of businesses. The government's plans will be more suitable and effective. The goal is to keep the economy stable and let industries work hard without worry.</p>
