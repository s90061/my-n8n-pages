            <h1>Europe and US Trade Agreement Details Revealed, European Stocks Mostly Up</h1>
            <p>Today, the United States and the European Union shared the details of their trade agreement. In the future, most goods from the EU going to the US will have a 15% tax. This means the uncertainty about how much tax the US would add is now over. Because of this, most major stock markets in Europe closed higher today.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 21.06 points, which is 0.23%. It closed at 9309.20 points.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine's Security Plans: Reuters Says Europe Might Send Troops Under US Command</h1>
            <p>Today, the US military said that military leaders from the United States and some European countries have finished looking at military options for Ukraine. They will give these ideas to their country's national security advisors to think about. Sources said that one idea is to send European troops to Ukraine, and the US would lead and control them.</p>
            <p>US President Trump has promised to help protect Ukraine based on any agreement that ends Russia's war there. Reuters had reported before that military planners from the US and Europe had started to look into ways to keep Ukraine safe after the conflict.</p>
            <p>The US military said in a statement, "These options will be given to each country's national security advisors. They will consider them as part of ongoing talks."</p>
            <p>Defense leaders from the United States, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine met in Washington from August 19 to 21.</p>
            <p>Reuters was the first to report that the plans to be given to the national security advisors are now complete.</p>
            <p>On August 18, Trump promised to provide security to Kyiv at a meeting. Ukraine and its European friends were happy about this, but many questions still need answers.</p>
            <p>Officials said that US and European planners need time to find out which plans are possible militarily and which ones the Kremlin would accept.</p>
            <p>Sources told Reuters that one option is to send European troops to Ukraine, but the United States would be in charge of leading and controlling them.</p>
            <p>To help reach a peace agreement, Western countries want NATO countries to be able to send troops. However, Russia's foreign ministry has said no to this idea.</p>
            <p>Trump had said publicly that he would not send US troops to Ukraine. But on August 19, he seemed to open the door for the US to be involved militarily in other ways.</p>
            <p>The United States could offer air support in different ways. This includes giving Ukraine more systems to defend against air attacks and setting up a no-fly zone with US fighter jets.</p>

            <h1>Israel Prepares to Take Gaza City, Tells Hospitals and Aid Groups to Plan for People to Leave</h1>
            <p>Today, the Israeli military said they have told medical staff and aid groups in northern Gaza to start planning how to help local people leave. Israel is getting ready to begin a military attack to take over Gaza City, which is in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that, according to an Israeli military statement, Israeli military officers this week told "medical leaders and international groups in northern Gaza Strip... to get ready for people to move to the southern Gaza Strip."</p>
            <p>This week, Israel's Ministry of Defense approved the plan to attack and take Gaza City. They also called up about 60,000 reserve soldiers. This makes people worry even more that the terrible humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip could get much worse.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that the Israeli military has told all involved parties to start making plans to move hospital equipment to the southern Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "Officials told medical leaders that hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip are being changed to receive sick and injured people. More important medical equipment is also being moved there."</p>
