This was Taiwan's first gold medal at this Asian Soft Tennis Championship.</p>
            <p>Zhu Wen-qing, the head of the Soft Tennis Association, said this mixed doubles gold medal made the whole team feel very happy.

            <h1>Jimmy Kimmel's Show Stops After Comments on Kirk Shooting, Hollywood Supports Him</h1>
            <p>The TV channel ABC has stopped Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show. This happened after he spoke about the shooting of Charlie Kirk. Kirk was a conservative political figure. Today, Hollywood people are supporting Kimmel. They are also saying that the White House is trying to stop people from speaking freely.</p>
            <p>ABC, which belongs to Disney, said that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will not be on TV for an unknown time. This is because at least one TV station did not want to show it. Also, the main TV regulator threatened to look into Kimmel's comments.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that Jimmy Kimmel has often criticized former President Trump. On his show on September 15, he talked about Charlie Kirk being killed. Kimmel said that Kirk's friends were using his death to get political advantages.</p>
            <p>The Writers Guild and the Screen Actors Guild said that stopping Kimmel's show because of his comments is against the right to speak freely. This right is in the constitution. They also said that ABC should not let the government make them do this.</p>
            <p>This is another important event after other media people, university staff, teachers, and business workers faced problems for talking about Kirk's death.</p>
            <p>Kirk was killed last week in Utah. He was 31 years old. A 22-year-old person has been accused of the crime. However, nobody knows why the crime happened yet.</p>
