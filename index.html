            <h1>Taichung Rain Breaks 13-Year Record; 14 Hiking Trails in Dakeng Closed Due to Damage</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain from a southwest air current caused the amount of rain in Taichung City to break a 13-year record on that day. In the Dakeng scenic area, 14 hiking trails were damaged in many places. The trail facilities were broken, and the roads connecting to them collapsed. The Taichung City Government announced that all 14 trails are now closed.</p>
            <p>Because of continuous heavy rain, the 14 hiking trails in Taichung City's Dakeng scenic area suffered a lot of damage. This includes broken trail facilities and collapsed roads to the trails. The Taichung City Government's Scenic Area Management Office said today in a written statement that their first check showed trail number 1's exercise area has no power. Trails 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 have many places where soil and rocks have fallen down slopes, and trail facilities are broken.</p>
            <p>Considering the safety of hikers and the unstable ground after the disaster, the Taichung City Government announced on July 31 that all 14 Dakeng trails are completely closed. They ask people not to go hiking in the Dakeng mountains for now, to keep themselves safe. They will update information about opening the trails again as the repairs progress.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Civil Affairs Bureau said earlier that the amount of rain in Taichung City on July 31 was the highest in 13 years. As of 3 PM today, the Taichung City Government's emergency center has received 5 reports of landslides, falling rocks, or damaged drainage systems on hillsides and farm roads in Beitun, Fengyuan, Wufeng, and Dongshi districts. Workers have been sent to check the sites and machines are being used to clear the farm roads. One house in Wuqi District had some flooding, but the water has now gone down.</p>
            <p>Due to continuous rain, there were landslides and road collapses recently. The Construction Bureau has been working hard to fix them. Except for a collapsed slope under Dahuhu Bridge on Zhucun Road in Taiping District, which exposed the bridge supports and caused the bridge to be closed, all other city roads maintained by the Construction Bureau have been cleared and are open for traffic. Workers are still cleaning soil and rocks from the roads.</p>

            <h1>Issey Takahashi Comes to Taiwan to Promote New Film, Says His Happiness Score is 100%</h1>
            <p>Japanese actor Issey Takahashi came to Taiwan to promote his new movie. The movie talks about family, happiness, fate, and love. He thanked the role he played for giving him good experiences. He feels very happy now. He said, 'Just being alive now makes me happy, so my happiness score is 100%.' </p>
            <p>Issey Takahashi and director Kazutaka Watanabe attended the press conference today for their new movie, 'Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe - The Confessional Room'. Kazutaka Watanabe said the movie was filmed in Italy. He explained, 'That place has many world heritage sites, showing a very bright side. But it also has dark and shady places. Elements of the Black Death were used a lot in the movie.' </p>
            <p>Issey Takahashi said that the movie tried many new things. He said, 'We did not change the original story, but we added some new content. We connected them very well. In this movie, you can see the world of the story and new parts of it.' </p>
            <p>In 2023, Issey Takahashi played Rohan Kishibe in 'Rohan at the Louvre'. This time, in 'Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe - The Confessional Room', he plays the same role again. He will go into a dark confessional room, facing the deep secrets and sins of people's hearts. He will show the character's deeper feelings and a strong presence.</p>
            <p>Issey Takahashi thanked the people of Taiwan for their support. He said, 'At the Q&A session after the movie, I saw a lot of positive support and love from the Taiwanese audience. Their love was so strong that they almost grabbed me and said, "I really love your work." ' </p>
            <p>Issey Takahashi shared that playing this role has almost changed his whole life. He said, 'When I was 18, I was very confused. I didn't know what kind of person I wanted to be. But I met this role, and it made me start thinking, 'Should I become the person society expects me to be?' I like how the character strongly believes in pursuing things. Even if people say he's strange, it doesn't matter. I want to pursue what I like and not care what others think.' </p>
            <p>Issey Takahashi admitted that after he started working, he met many fake things and people who pretended to be someone else. He said, 'In this role, I found his true self, and I also want to find my own true self.' </p>
            <p>The movie talks about happiness. Issey Takahashi said he has always been happy, but he also started to think, 'If happiness continues all the time, it will feel very normal, almost like being in hell. You should experience some sadness, feel a bit worried and troubled sometimes. Only then can you truly feel the sweet taste of happiness.' </p>
            <p>When asked about his happiness score now, he smiled and said, 'Being alive now is happiness. Actually, my happiness score always changes. Right now, I can say my happiness score is 100%.' </p>
