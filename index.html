            <h1>Typhoon Yangliu approaches, Yushan Protected Area closed, Cingjing Guest House closed</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's weather office has issued a sea warning for Typhoon Yangliu. The Yushan National Park office said that starting at 5:30 AM on August 12, people cannot enter the park's protected areas. Also, the Cingjing Guest House will close from 2 PM. The Cingjing Green Green Grassland will only allow people to leave, not enter. Only about 500 visitors are left there.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation issued a sea warning for Typhoon Yangliu this morning. The Yushan National Park office said that when a typhoon warning is issued, entry permits that were given before are no longer valid during this time. After the typhoon, if people want to enter the protected area again, they must apply again. The park will announce when it is safe to enter again after the typhoon warning is lifted and they check for damage.</p>
            <p>The Yushan National Park office reminds hikers who are already in the mountains to check for the latest information. They should get ready to respond, contact their emergency contact person quickly, and plan to leave the dangerous areas or find a safe place. Hikers who have not yet gone up the mountain should cancel their trips right away to avoid accidents in the mountains.</p>
            <p>According to the Yushan National Park office's data at 11 AM today, a total of 86 groups and 299 people applied to enter the park. Out of these, 18 groups with 83 people were told not to go up the mountain and did not. 8 groups with 25 people have already come down. 10 groups with 22 people are staying in safe places in the mountains. 6 groups with 20 people are taking shelter where they are. 36 groups with 132 people are currently coming down. 8 groups with 17 people entered the park, but the office could not contact them.</p>
            <p>The Cingjing Farm Guest House, run by the Veterans Affairs Council, will close from 2 PM today. The Green Green Grassland will only allow visitors to leave, not enter, from 2 PM. The sheep and horse shows in the afternoon will still happen. Cingjing Farm said that the sun was shining this morning, but there were fewer visitors, only about 500.

            <h1>KMT Legislators: More than half of Taitung residents oppose wind power development, demand developers withdraw plans</h1>
            <p>The East Wind Power Company is planning to hold a meeting in the Taitung Nanè¿´ area. At this meeting, they will talk about the environmental effects of their wind power project. On August 12, Legislator Huang Chien-pin from the Kuomintang (KMT) party said that a survey shows more than half of Taitung residents do not support building wind turbines along the coast. He said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Environment should immediately tell the company to stop this project. He believes the project has no public support and will harm the environment. He wants the company to cancel the project.</p>
            <p>In the morning, KMT legislators Huang Chien-pin, Wu Tsung-hsien, Cheng Tien-tsai, and independent legislator Kao Chin Su-mei held a press conference at the Legislative Yuan. They said that wind power companies are still trying to build wind turbines on Taiwan's beautiful east coast, even though local people are strongly against it. More than half of Taitung residents do not want wind turbines on the east coast. The legislators asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Environment to immediately tell the companies to stop all development.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-pin pointed out that the "Dongcheng" and "Dongfeng" land-based wind power projects are led by Taiya Wind Energy Company. These projects plan to build 58 large wind turbines in Chenggong Township, Changbin Township, Taimali Township, Dawu Township, and Daren Township in Taitung. This has caused strong disagreement from local people. They are worried that the projects will hurt the local environment, the lives of residents, and the traditional areas of indigenous tribes.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-pin said that the wind turbines would be placed along Taiwan's most beautiful coastlines, which are Provincial Highway 9 and Provincial Highway 11. If these areas are filled with large wind turbines, Taiwan's famous beautiful sea view facing the Pacific Ocean will become a line of big man-made fans. This would destroy a shared memory for all Taitung people. The many different types of plants and animals along the coast would also be greatly harmed by the wind turbines. The low-frequency noise from the wind turbines could also affect the health and daily lives of residents, and even impact the traditional lands of indigenous people.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-pin stated that a survey by a national polling company shows that 50.7% of Taitung residents do not support building wind turbines along the Taitung coast. This proves that most Taitung people are against wind power that harms the coastline, and stopping it immediately is what the public wants. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Environment should immediately tell the companies to stop developing wind power. This is because there is no agreement from the public and the projects would harm the environment. They should not push any more development and should cancel the projects.</p>
            <p>Kao Chin Su-mei pointed out that data on "Taipower System Generating Capacity for Each Unit" clearly shows that wind power is not very effective. She said that building wind farms on the west coast in the past caused damage and proved that wind power is not a good source of energy. So, she asked why the government still insists on damaging Taiwan's most beautiful east coast to build wind farms that are not very effective.</p>
            <p>Kao Chin Su-mei strongly opposes building wind farms that are not effective. She also asked all levels of government and companies that are developing projects to follow the Indigenous Peoples Basic Act. This is very important if their projects affect traditional indigenous lands or tribes. They must make sure indigenous people have the right to be consulted and agree to the projects.</p>
            <p>Cheng Tien-tsai noted that the leaders and chairpersons of seven Amis tribes in Changbin Township, Taitung County, have signed a joint statement. This statement asks the government and companies to immediately stop and cancel the development projects. They also ask them to stop any actions that the tribes have not agreed to. As an Amis legislator, he fully supports the four main demands of the local tribes: they are against building large wind turbines in their traditional areas, they want the Indigenous Peoples Basic Act's right to consultation and agreement to be followed, and they are against separate deals that divide the tribes.</p>

            <h1>Hung Shen-han: Estimated tariff impact on workers has decreased from 120,000 to 42,000 people</h1>
            <p>On August 12, Minister of Labor Hung Shen-han said that due to ongoing talks with the government, the tariffs from the US have gone down. They were 32% and are now 20%. Because of this, the number of workers who might be affected has also gone down. In April, it was thought that 120,000 workers could be affected. Now, it is estimated that 42,000 workers might be affected.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Executive Yuan talked about the US equal tariffs and plans to help industries. Deputy Premier Cheng Li-chiun said that the impact on jobs from these tariffs includes things like reduced work hours or lower pay. She stressed that 42,000 affected people does not mean all of them will lose their jobs. The government has also introduced various support measures.</p>
            <p>Regarding the US equal tariffs, Minister of Labor Hung Shen-han said on Facebook today that the impact on jobs includes different types of effects, such as reduced work hours or losing jobs. He explained that "42,000 affected people" does not mean all of them will lose their jobs. The Ministry of Labor will give special funding to help workers in affected industries who are still employed. They will try their best to keep these workers in their jobs so they do not become unemployed.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han pointed out that trade talks have lowered the equal tariffs. In April, the tariffs were the original rate plus 32%. Now, in August, they are the original rate plus 20%. The talks are still ongoing. According to experts, the number of workers who might be affected has gone down from 120,000 in April to 42,000 now. The Ministry of Labor will not be too happy or relaxed about this. They will still carefully prepare for all possible problems.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han stated that looking at Taiwan's current unemployment rate, the rate in June this year was the lowest for that month since 2001. The number of people working was also the highest for that month in history. The Ministry of Labor will continue to closely watch all labor signs. They will have all plans ready to help workers deal with the effects of the equal tariffs.</p>
            <p>Finally, Hung Shen-han mentioned that the Ministry of Labor started preparing for the tariffs in April. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan also approved the "Measures to Support Stable Employment for Workers in Response to International Situations." This plan was created by the Ministry of Labor based on special laws. The goal is to do their very best to help workers keep their jobs stable during these changing times.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han emphasized that the Ministry of Labor will quickly finish the legal work needed. They will also adjust the support plans as needed to make them stronger. They will do their best to help and support workers who might be affected by the equal tariffs. This is to help them with the challenges of uncertain job situations.</p>
