            <h1>Typhoons and Heavy Rain in July and August: Chen Chi-mai Says Recovery in Indigenous Areas Will Be Stronger</h1>
            <p>Mayor Chen Chi-mai of Kaohsiung City said today in a city meeting that three aboriginal areas were greatly damaged by heavy rain. He asked the correct departments and local offices to help them rebuild. He also told these departments to ask house owners to put in smoke alarms by themselves.</p>
            <p>In the city meeting, Chen Chi-mai heard a report from the Indigenous Peoples Commission. It talked about how the three aboriginal areas â€“ Maolin, Taoyuan, and Namasia â€“ are now getting better after the heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai said that the aboriginal areas were very damaged by the heavy rain. He asked the important departments and local offices to help these three aboriginal areas rebuild quickly.</p>
            <p>Also, school is starting soon. Chen Chi-mai reminded the Education Bureau to make sure all schools keep their areas clean, manage how students get to school, and ensure good health and safe school lunches. He also said that for the referendum on August 23rd, all preparations should be done well, and the police department should keep public safety.</p>
            <p>Finally, Chen Chi-mai pointed out that the Kaohsiung City Government changed a rule last August. This rule is called the "Kaohsiung City Fire Prevention Self-Government Ordinance." It says that if a home does not have an automatic fire alarm system, the owner must put in a "residential fire alarm." If they do not do this after a set time, they will have to pay a fine.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai said this rule will begin on September 1st this year. He asked the Fire Department, Public Works Bureau, and Civil Affairs Bureau to tell more people about it. They should remind owners of houses and apartments that it is important to install smoke alarms themselves.</p>

            <h1>Over 20,000 People Moved: "Tears of a Fire God" Musical Adds More Shows</h1>
            <p>The musical "Tears of a Fire God" tells stories about firefighters, their families, friends, and their work. Since it first opened, more than 20,000 people have watched it and cried because they were so moved. Story Works and Crazy Musical Studio have announced that they will perform more shows in Taipei and Chiayi.</p>
            <p>Story Works shared today in a news release that the musical "Tears of a Fire God" was changed and directed by Huang Chih-kai, who is the art director and also wrote the song words. Wang Hsi-wen, who often wins important awards, made the music and directed it. The actors include Yang Ta-cheng, Fang Yu-hsin, Wang Wei, Chou Chia-kuan, Lo Mei-ling, Shih Yuan-chieh, and 23 other skilled musical actors. On stage, they perform with a lot of energy, mixing music and acting to tell a story that has both strong feelings and sad moments.</p>
            <p>The main actor, Yang Ta-cheng, said he had planned to stop working in theater for a while. But this play moved him greatly. He felt it was very important to help bring this play to a good end. Fang Yu-hsin also said that during practice, she deeply admired firefighters for always being brave and not asking for anything back. She said, "In the play, I need to use a ladder truck to save people. But I am actually scared of high places. However, I think when a life is waiting to be saved, my own fear feels very small."</p>
            <p>The musical "Tears of a Fire God" will be performed from August 22nd to 24th at the Taipei Performing Arts Center. It will also be performed on September 6th at the Chiayi Performing Arts Center.</p>

            <h1>Thailand Builds Buddhist Temple Similar to Angkor Wat; Cambodia Calls It Cultural Theft</h1>
            <p>Not long before Thailand and Cambodia had a border disagreement in late July this year, the two countries started arguing. The argument was about a Buddhist temple that is being built in Thailand. This temple looks very much like Angkor Wat, which is a very old and important place in Cambodia. Because of this, some people said it was copied.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Asia reported that the temple, called Wat Phu Man Fah, is in Buriram province, Thailand. It is about 3 hectares in size and built with sandstone bricks. Many parts of it, like the statues of the snake god "Naga," the carvings on the walls, and the walkways around the main building, look very similar to Angkor Wat.</p>
            <p>Angkor Wat was built in the 12th century. It is a sign of the Khmer Empire, which was very powerful in Southeast Asia a long time ago. Khmer people in Cambodia care deeply about it. It is even on Cambodia's flag.</p>
            <p>In May, Thailand and Cambodia had a fight over land, and their relationship quickly got worse. People in both countries felt less positive about each other. The argument about Wat Phu Man Fah also grew stronger. For Cambodia, this temple looked like Thailand was trying to cause problems.</p>
            <p>In a meeting of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in July, Phoeurng Sackona, Cambodia's Minister of Culture and Arts, spoke. She said that building Wat Phu Man Fah was a clear example of stealing culture and an unethical copy. She warned that such actions would set a bad example and could make world heritage sites less special.</p>
            <p>The government of Thailand said that Wat Phu Man Fah did not copy Angkor Wat. They said the temple was built following old Thai buildings and traditions. They also said they did not want to make the problems between the two countries worse.</p>
            <p>Thailand was strongly influenced by the Khmer Empire in the past. There are many old buildings in the Khmer style in Thailand. Some of these buildings are close to the border between Thailand and Cambodia. This can easily lead to arguments about which country truly owns the cultural style.</p>
            <p>As the argument about Wat Phu Man Fah became more public, many more tourists came to visit.</p>
            <p>A woman in her 50s who lives and works near Wat Phu Man Fah said that not many religious people visited the temple before. But recently, on weekends, thousands of tourists come. Many of them come because they feel proud of their country.</p>
            <p>The head monk of Wat Phu Man Fah was worried about this. He said that the temple was built to help people have more faith. He said, "I am happy that more people are coming, but this should not be used for political arguments."</p>
