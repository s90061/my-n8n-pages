            <h1>Keelung: Police Officers Can Take 1 Day of Official Leave to Help in Hualien Disaster Relief Before October 15</h1>
            <p>Hualien County's Mataian Creek dam overflowed and caused serious damage to Guangfu Township. The head of Keelung City Police Department, Lin Hsin-hsiung, announced today that police officers and staff from the city and different police stations can take 1 day of official leave if they volunteer to help with disaster relief on a working day. This offer is valid until October 15.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsin-hsiung said in the LINE group "Keelung Police Supervisors Group" this morning that because of the severe disaster in Guangfu Township, Hualien, all staff from the Keelung City Police Department and its stations can have 1 day of official leave if they volunteer to help with recovery work on a working day.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsin-hsiung also said that staff who want to go to Hualien can tell their units. They do not need to show proof later. Each unit should agree first, making sure it does not affect their normal duties. The units will make a list of those who go. Within 3 days, staff from the city police department will send the list to the personnel office for approval. Police substations can report to their division for approval.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsin-hsiung said this plan is valid until October 15. He asked all division heads to tell their staff and also asked the personnel office and all division's personnel units to help fully.</p>

            <h1>Coast Guard Administration: Special Budget for National Security Resilience is Very Urgent</h1>
            <p>Media reported that the special budget for national security resilience is not urgent. The Ocean Affairs Council Coast Guard Administration said today that China's "grey zone" actions keep bothering Taiwan. The yearly budget and current staff and equipment are not enough to deal with this. They asked everyone to support the Coast Guard's urgent need for a special budget.</p>
            <p>The Liberty Times reported that the Legislative Yuan's budget center recently looked at the Executive Yuan's "Special Budget Plan for Strengthening Economic, Social, and Public National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations." It questioned if the "strengthening national land defense capability" part of the special budget was urgent, which was similar to what blue and white party lawmakers said.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration explained in a press release this afternoon that Taiwan continues to face military threats from China. The situation in the seas is becoming more serious. The Ocean Affairs Council must handle many challenges for national security, public safety, and peace. Especially, China's "grey zone" actions keep trying to find weaknesses in Taiwan's defense. The yearly budget and current staff and equipment are not enough to deal with the difficult international situation and the growing "grey zone" threats.</p>
            <p>At the same time, it is very important to include more than NT$29.5 billion in the budget under the "Special Budget for Strengthening Economic, Social, and Public National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations." This money will fully support the Coast Guard's modernization and overall ability improvement.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration said that to solve the problem of not having enough resources on land and at sea, the Ocean Affairs Council has told the Coast Guard Administration to improve its abilities in air, sea, and land. This includes stronger air power for the Coast Guard, modern radars, and checking all sea areas to build a complete monitoring network.</p>
            <p>Also, they will increase the number of ships at the front line to respond more flexibly to China's "grey zone" strategies. They will also work hard to make their support equipment better.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration said they hope to quickly build infrared thermal imaging systems and other facilities along all coasts of Taiwan. This will improve how they protect the country at night when it's hard to see with just eyes. They also want to add land, sea, and air detection abilities so that Coast Guard officers can protect the seas better and in a more complete way, dealing with China's many types of threats.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration emphasized that the government offering the special law for national security resilience and preparing a special budget shows the country's strong decision. It is also a promise to the people of Taiwan: to see the threats and be ready to face them. They need to quickly build new ships and bring in unmanned vehicles and infrared monitoring devices to make their ability to enforce laws in the sea stronger.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration asked everyone to support the urgent need for the Coast Guard to get this special budget. This will make the ocean not just a border, but also Taiwan's first line of defense for safety.</p>

            <h1>Danish Military Confirms Unknown Drones Spotted at Military Sites for Two Nights</h1>
            <p>The Danish military said today that unknown drones have been seen flying over several military sites in the country for two nights in a row. For the past week, people in different parts of Denmark have continuously seen unknown drones.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Danish military said in a statement: "The military can confirm that several drones were seen at night over various military locations, and we have moved military forces to respond."</p>
            <p>The Danish military did not give more details about these events or how the army responded.</p>
            <p>Danish media reported that no airports in the country were closed at night.</p>
            <p>Since September 22, there have been many reports of unknown drones in Denmark and Norway. This caused several airports to close for some time. The Danish government has suggested that Russia might be involved.</p>
            <p>On September 27, the Danish military also said that unknown drones were seen at "several military locations" during the night of September 26 to 27, but they did not give more details.</p>
            <p>The Danish police confirmed that on the evening of September 26, "1 to 2 drones" were seen flying near and over the Karup military base. This is Denmark's largest military base, where all army helicopters, air space monitoring equipment, flight school, and support units are located.</p>
            <p>A NATO spokesperson said that after the drone incidents, NATO has increased its readiness in the Baltic Sea area.</p>
