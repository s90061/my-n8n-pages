            <h1>Boeing Fighter Jet Factory Workers to Strike After Second Failed Talks</h1>
            <p>In the Midwest of the United States, thousands of union workers at two Boeing fighter jet factories in Missouri and Illinois will start striking early tomorrow. This comes after they said no to a new work contract from Boeing.</p>
            <p>The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) shared a statement. It said, "Around 3,200 skilled IAM union members at Boeing factories... voted on August 3, 2025, to reject the company's new, changed four-year work agreement."</p>
            <p>The union stated, "The strike will begin at midnight on Monday, August 4."</p>
            <p>Boeing, a very big aviation company, first offered a 20% pay raise over four years and more days off. Workers rejected this offer a week ago. Boeing said their new offer would double the pay raise.</p>
            <p>Dan Gillian, who is a Vice President at Boeing Air Dominance and manager of the St. Louis factory in Missouri, said in a statement: "We are sad that our employees voted against this offer. This offer included an average pay raise of 40% and also fixed their main worries about different work hours."</p>
            <p>Gillian added, "We are ready for the strike. We have started our full plan to make sure that employees who are not striking can continue to help our customers."</p>
            <p>Boeing, a company with a long history, has been in trouble since last year. This is because of problems with how they make products and check their quality. Also, a seven-week strike stopped work at two of Boeing's main factories.</p>
            <p>IAM is one of the biggest unions in North America. It represents about 600,000 members in industries like aerospace, defense, shipbuilding, transport, healthcare, and manufacturing.</p>

            <h1>Hsu Wei-ling Tied for 6th at LPGA British Open, Her Best Career Result</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's top female golfer, Hsu Wei-ling, finished the final round of the LPGA British Open today with 70 strokes. She got 3 birdies, 1 eagle, and 3 bogeys. Over four days, she scored 282 strokes, which is 6 strokes under par. This put her in a tie for 6th place, her best result ever in this competition.</p>
            <p>The British Open has a total prize of 9.5 million US dollars (about 280 million New Taiwan Dollars). It is the last of the five biggest yearly tournaments in the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour. This year, it was held in Wales. Taiwan's Hsu Wei-ling and Yani Tseng successfully made it to the next stage.</p>
            <p>Hsu Wei-ling started the final round today from the first hole. She made two bogeys right away. Luckily, she got a birdie on the 4th hole to make up for it. Then, she got a great eagle on the par-5 6th hole, which helped her get back on track.</p>
            <p>After the game, Hsu Wei-ling spoke to the media. She said she felt a bit nervous at the start and played too fast in the first two holes. But after getting a birdie on the 4th hole, she felt a bit more relaxed. After getting the eagle on the 6th hole, she finally got back to her usual game rhythm.</p>
            <p>This year was Hsu Wei-ling's eighth time playing in the British Open. Her best result before was tied for 23rd place in 2017. This year, she not only got tied for 6th place but also won 302,000 US dollars (about 9.05 million New Taiwan Dollars) in prize money.</p>
            <p>Hsu Wei-ling said that she didn't play well on holes 14-17 during the first three days. "So today, I told my caddy that if I could get through these four holes steadily, it would be fine," she explained. "That's why I chose to play more carefully. Because of this, I was able to relax and get a birdie on the last hole."</p>
            <p>After four hard days at the British Open, Hsu Wei-ling decided to take at least one week off. She smiled and said, "The wind here was really strong, so strong that it affected even putting. I've played three competitions in four weeks in Europe. I really need to rest. Now my knee muscles feel very sore."</p>
            <p>Hsu Wei-ling was planning to play in the LPGA Portland Classic, which starts on August 14. However, because of her good result at the British Open this week, she has moved up to 52nd place on the LPGA points list. This means she can definitely take one or two more breaks.</p>
