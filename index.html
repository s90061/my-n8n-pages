            <h1>UN Assembly Votes to Support a Palestinian State Without Hamas; Israel Calls it Shameful</h1>
            <p>The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution today. It supports a plan for two states for Israel and Palestine. But it does not include Hamas. Israel said this will make the armed group continue the war.</p>
            <p>The resolution from the UN General Assembly got 142 votes for it. 10 countries, including Israel and the US, voted against it. 12 countries did not vote.</p>
            <p>This resolution clearly condemns Hamas. It also asks the armed group to give up its weapons.</p>
            <p>The resolution's full name is "New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution." It clearly states that "Hamas must release all hostages." The UN General Assembly also condemns "Hamas's attacks on civilians on October 7, 2023."</p>
            <p>The resolution also calls for "everyone to work together to end the war in Gaza. It asks for a fair, peaceful, and lasting solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine, based on the two-state plan."</p>
            <p>Hussein al-Sheikh, the Vice Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed this. He said it "shows that countries around the world want to support our people's rights. It is an important step to end the occupation and create an independent state."</p>
            <p>But Israel said the UN General Assembly's vote to support a "Palestinian state without Hamas" is shameful. They said it will make the armed group continue the war.</p>
            <p>Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for Israel's Foreign Ministry, wrote on X (a social media platform): "This resolution does not help bring a peaceful solution. Instead, it encourages Hamas to continue the war. Israel thanks all the countries that did not support this shameful decision in the Assembly."</p>

            <h1>Trump: Will Send National Guard to Memphis to Fight Crime</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that he will send the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee. This is his newest plan to fight crime strictly. But some people who criticize him say this action is too strict and like a dictator's power.</p>
            <p>The Republican president has already sent the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington. He also promised to send them to other cities, like Chicago and New York.</p>
            <p>Some local people are happy about the National Guard patrolling. But other people complain. They say the National Guard is not good at dealing with crime. They also say this action is mainly against immigrant groups.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to Fox News and said: "We are going to Memphis. Memphis has a big problem. The mayor is happy, and the governor is happy... We will solve the problem like we did in Washington."</p>
            <p>Memphis is a city where most people are Black. It has a mayor from the Democratic Party. The governor of Tennessee is from the Republican Party.</p>
            <p>This week, Trump's government started a new police action in Chicago. It focuses on immigrants who they call "the most dangerous criminals." Trump has also often said he would send the National Guard to Chicago. He argued with JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, on social media.</p>
            <p>Trump says that sending the National Guard and removing people in Washington and Los Angeles saved the cities from crimes by immigrants. This is one of his main promises for his election campaign.</p>

            <h1>WB Boxing World Championships: Chen Nien-Chin Loses in Semi-Finals, Still Wins Bronze Medal</h1>
            <p>At the WB Boxing World Championships in Liverpool, UK, Taiwan's "anti-cancer female boxer" Chen Nien-Chin fought against Navbakhor Khamidova from Uzbekistan in the women's 65kg semi-finals today. Chen Nien-Chin lost 2 to 3, but she still won a bronze medal.</p>
            <p>This was the first World Championships held by World Boxing (WB) after the International Olympic Committee approved it. More than 60 countries and 500 boxers joined the competition.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's good boxer Chen Nien-Chin faced Navbakhor Khamidova in the semi-finals today. They had fought before in the quarter-finals of last year's Paris Olympics, where Chen Nien-Chin won 5 to 0.</p>
            <p>Today, they fought again. Khamidova was ready. In the first round, she threw many strong punches and hit Chen Nien-Chin well. Four out of five judges gave her 10 points.</p>
            <p>In the second round, Chen Nien-Chin attacked more. Both boxers hit each other many times in the ring. No one clearly had an advantage. Three out of five judges still gave Khamidova 10 points. After the first two rounds, Chen Nien-Chin was behind by a score of 1 to 3.</p>
            <p>In the final round, Chen Nien-Chin tried to make a comeback. Khamidova also seemed a bit tired. Chen Nien-Chin hit her opponent successfully many times at the start of the round. But in the last minute, her opponent improved her defense. This made it hard for Chen Nien-Chin to find chances to attack. Even though four judges gave Chen Nien-Chin 10 points in the third round, she still lost by a total score of 2 to 3.</p>
            <p>Coach Ko Wen-Ming said that being behind in the first round was important. He said the opponent was experienced, so it was hard to catch up. He felt it was a pity, but he still wanted to encourage Nien-Chin for winning the bronze medal.</p>
            <p>After Chen Nien-Chin stopped in the semi-finals, only Huang Hsiao-Wen from Taiwan is left in the women's 54kg semi-finals. She is expected to fight against Lim Ae-ji, a good Korean boxer who won a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, at 7:45 PM Taiwan time.</p>
