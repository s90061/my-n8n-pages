            <h1>United States May Give Safety Help, Zelenskyy Calls It a "History-Making" Choice</h1>
            <p>Before meeting with US President Donald Trump tomorrow, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today praised the United States' decision to give safety help to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that he said on social media X, "The United States is ready to be part of giving safety help to Ukraine. This is a very important decision for history."</p>
            <p>He wrote, "With our shared hard work, this safety help must be very practical. It needs to give protection on land, in the air, and at sea. Also, European countries must be part of it."</p>
            <p>A group of Ukraine's European friends, including leaders from the UK, France, and Germany, had an online meeting earlier today. Zelenskyy shared this message after their meeting.</p>

            <h1>Macron: Will Ask Trump About Safety Help for Ukraine</h1>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron said today that European leaders will ask US President Donald Trump how much he supports providing safety help for Ukraine. Macron also said he does not believe Russia truly wants peace.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that some European leaders will go with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington tomorrow to meet Trump. Macron made these comments at his summer home after a phone call to agree on their shared position.</p>
            <p>Macron said, "We want to show a united front between Europeans and Ukrainians." He also said they would ask how ready the US is to help with safety guarantees for Ukraine in a peace deal.</p>
            <p>He added that just as they cannot talk about Ukraine's land without Ukraine, they also "cannot talk about European safety without European countries being involved."</p>
            <p>Macron stressed that European leaders should be at all future high-level meetings about the Ukraine situation.</p>

            <h1>US Special Envoy: Russia Agrees Ukraine Can Get Safety Help Like NATO's Collective Defense</h1>
            <p>US President Trump will meet with Ukrainian and European leaders tomorrow to decide the details of possible safety help for Kyiv. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said today that Trump might offer Ukraine protection similar to NATO's, and Russia is open to this idea.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Witkoff told CNN's "State of the Union" show, "We got this agreement: the US can give protection like Article 5... This is the first time we heard the Russians agree to this."</p>
            <p>Witkoff was talking about Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This article says that an armed attack on one member country should be seen as an armed attack on all members. He said that this kind of safety help could replace Ukraine becoming a NATO member, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has always been against.</p>
            <p>Russia started a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In recent months, Russia has been slowly gaining ground in this war, which has caused the most deaths in Europe in 80 years.</p>
            <p>Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio were in the room when Trump and Putin met in Alaga, USA, on August 15. Today, before tomorrow's meetings with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies, both men gave several TV interviews.</p>
            <p>Rubio told Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures" show, "We believe we have made some progress, and now we must continue with this."</p>
            <p>"In the end, this should lead to a meeting of three leaders: Zelenskyy, Putin, and President Trump. We might finish this there. But before we get to that stage, we need to make this closer to that goal."</p>
            <p>Russian officials are against Western troops being in Ukraine, but they did not say no to giving safety help to Kyiv. When Trump and Putin appeared together after their meeting, Putin said, "I agree with President Trump. He said today that Ukraine's safety must be guaranteed no matter what. Of course, we are ready to work on this."</p>
            <p>Witkoff told Fox News Sunday that Russia has also agreed to pass a law stating they will not take more Ukrainian land by force.</p>
            <p>He said, "The Russians agreed to make a law after a peace deal is made. This law will prevent them, or show that they will not try to take more Ukrainian land. This will also show that they will not attack any European borders."</p>
