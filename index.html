            <h1>Markets Watch Trade Talks and Russian Energy Exports, International Oil Prices Slightly Down</h1>
            <p>International oil prices went down a little today. This is because there has not been enough progress in trade talks in the US. Also, new rules from the European Union have not stopped Russia from selling its energy. This makes people still worry about how much oil is needed.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August delivery went down by 14 cents, to $67.20 per barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price for Brent crude oil for September delivery went down by 7 cents, to $69.21 per barrel.</p>
