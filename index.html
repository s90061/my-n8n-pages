            <h1>Trump Says 100% Tariff on Chips; Companies Confused, Want Guidance</h1>
            <p>New York, August 7 (Central News Agency) â€“ Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump said he would put a 100% tax on all computer chips and semiconductors coming into the US. This made the prices of big chip companies' stocks go up. But many smaller companies are confused and want to know what might happen.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Limor Fried, who started and is an engineer at Adafruit Industries, a small electronics company in New York, said, "We are still waiting for official instructions."</p>
            <p>Adafruit uses chips from US companies and sellers. They also get chips directly from companies in the Philippines and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Fried said that if these chips do not get a tax exemption, "it will make our design costs higher. This is because semiconductors are the most expensive parts when we build our products... For many of these taxes, we usually have to wait until we get the bill to know the real effect. Then we change our prices to cover the extra costs."</p>
            <p>The US imports a small number of chips directly. This is because most chips not made in the US are already put into products like cars and Apple iPhones before they come to the US.</p>
            <p>Martin Chorzempa, an expert on China at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, "The real question for companies is: Will parts be taxed? This means, do chips inside devices need to be taxed separately?"</p>
            <p>On August 6, when Trump said he would put a 100% tax on chips and semiconductors imported to the US, he also said that companies that promise to build factories in the US, or are already doing so, will not have to pay these import taxes.</p>
            <p>Investors in Wall Street saw this news as good. It was good not only for US companies like Intel and Nvidia. It was also good for big Asian chip makers like TSMC and Samsung, who are working hard to build factories in the US.</p>
            <p>However, for smaller chip companies in Europe and Asia, this created more uncertainty. These companies are not very connected to the AI boom. But the semiconductors they make are still used widely in important things like cars or washing machines.</p>
            <p>Infineon Technologies, a big German semiconductor company, said in an email on August 7, "The company cannot guess about possible semiconductor taxes and Trump's statement. This is because no official documents have been released yet."</p>
            <p>Chorzempa pointed out that these manufacturers "may not be big enough to get an exemption. And they probably do not have enough money or profits to support big investments in the US."</p>
            <p>The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said today that they "really want to know more about the chip taxes. This includes how wide the exemptions will be and how they will work."</p>

            <h1>Trump to Meet Armenia and Azerbaijan Leaders for Peace Summit</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 7 (Central News Agency) â€“ US President Donald Trump announced that tomorrow he will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. He calls this a "historic peace summit." Its goal is to stop the long conflict between these two former Soviet countries.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump posted today on his social media site, Truth Social. He said that Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev "will be with me at the White House for a formal peace signing ceremony."</p>
            <p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have been enemies for decades. They have fought two times over the Karabakh region, which is a disputed area. In 2023, Azerbaijan quickly took back this area from the Armenian army. This made over 100,000 Armenians leave the area.</p>
            <p>The two countries have had many talks to find a peace solution. This includes talks last month in the United Arab Emirates. But it has been hard to make progress.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote, "These two countries have been at war for many years, and thousands of people have died."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Many leaders in the past tried to end the war between the two countries, but they did not succeed, until today, luckily, there is 'Trump.' My government has been talking with both sides for some time." He added, "These two brave leaders did the right thing, and I am very proud."</p>
            <p>Trump has said that he believes his efforts to help solve different international problems deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
            <p>He said that Washington will sign agreements with both countries. They will "work together to find economic chances, so we can fully use the potential of the South Caucasus region."</p>

            <h1>New Taipei Promotes E-sports for Seniors; Classes Start in September</h1>
            <p>New Taipei, August 8 (Central News Agency) â€“ New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih announced today that e-sports classes for older adults will start in September at the New Taipei E-sports Base. This is a mix of social welfare and the e-sports industry. It creates a place for learning e-sports not just for young people. It also lets older adults play games and feel good about their achievements.</p>
            <p>Today, the New Taipei City Government held an "All Ages Play Together, Happiness Never Stops" e-sports event at the New Taipei E-sports Base. Mayor Hou Yu-ih formed teams with older adults and young people. They played "G9: Alliance of Spies," "Street Fighter 6," and "Just Dance Unlimited." They showed their fast reactions and teamwork.</p>
            <p>Hou Yu-ih said that before, he mostly saw young people at the e-sports base. Now, he is very happy to see older adults also having fun there. He said that e-sports is not just a competitive sport. It is also a way to relax. Also, games can make family relationships better. He hopes every older adult can enjoy the happiness that e-sports brings.</p>
            <p>Hou Yu-ih said that by the end of July this year, there were 789,042 people aged 65 or older in New Taipei City. This is almost 20% of the city's total population. To deal with a society with many very old people, New Taipei City has senior clubs in every neighborhood. It also has 612 community care points. Now, they are adding e-sports. This will improve older adults' digital skills and thinking abilities. It will also help with hand-eye coordination and managing emotions. This helps create a "co-create, co-age, co-good" life for seniors.</p>
            <p>Ye Yu-nu, who is over 70, said in an interview that she used to not like her children and grandchildren playing video games. Family relationships became tense for a while. After her son-in-law talked to her, she watched and saw that e-sports helped her grandchildren relax and think. It did not hurt their schoolwork. It even helped her grandchildren connect what they learned in school with games and find their own path. Ye Yu-nu also uses e-sports to train her hand-eye coordination and improve her thinking. She often invites friends to play against her.</p>
            <p>Zhu Ke-fen, the head of the New Taipei E-sports Industry Association, said that the e-sports learning program for older adults shows being active, taking on challenges, and bringing different generations together. With help from professional coaches and interactive classes, older adults can improve their digital skills and have more fun in life. It also helps them have more conversations and connections with their children and friends.</p>
            <p>The Social Welfare Department of the New Taipei City Government said that these e-sports classes for older adults will start in September. The exact times are still being planned. They expect to have 3 classes and accept 60 students. Registration will be from August 13 to August 27. The list of accepted students will be announced on August 28. If too many people sign up, students will be chosen by a computer lottery. Information on how to sign up will be posted on the New Taipei City Social Welfare Department's Facebook page or the New Taipei E-sports Base's Facebook page.</p>
