            <h1>Kuo Li-yang Wins Gold at Speed Skating World Championships, First Taiwanese to Do So</h1>
            <p>During the World Speed Skating Championships in China, Taiwanese athlete Kuo Li-yang won a gold medal today. He competed in the adult men's 200-meter time trial and finished in 17.599 seconds. This is the first time a Taiwanese person has achieved this. After the race, he was very happy and said, "It feels great!"</p>
            <p>The 2025 Speed Skating World Championships started today in Beidaihe, China. Kuo Li-yang, who is only 22 years old, won a silver medal last month at the World Games in Chengdu for the men's 200-meter track pursuit. Now, at the World Championships, he was the best in the adult men's 200-meter time trial.</p>
            <p>Kuo Li-yang won the gold medal with a time of 17.599 seconds. Jhoan Guzman from Spain won the silver medal, and Vincenzo Maiorca from Italy won the bronze medal.</p>
            <p>Kuo Li-yang had always come close to winning a gold medal at the World Championships but never did. After the race, he told Central News Agency that when he heard his time, he saw his coaches cheering in the rest area. He then guessed that he had won the gold medal. "It feels great," he said, "because the 200-meter race really depends on how well your opponent performs on the day. A small mistake can make a big difference, so I'm glad I did well this time."</p>
            <p>Kuo Li-yang started skating when he was in kindergarten. He officially became an athlete in elementary school and loved the excitement of racing against others. Now, he has finally become a real "world champion." He smiled and said he is very thankful for his family's support and for his first coach, Lin Yung-hsiang, who helped him with training and body preparation. "He helps me stay calm, and I feel much more relaxed when he is there," Kuo said.</p>
            <p>His coach, Liu Yu-shen, said that they expected Kuo Li-yang to at least win a medal. Today, he performed at 120% of his ability, fighting hard from start to finish. Especially near the end, he did a rare move where he leaned across the finish line, showing how much he wanted to win. His way of handling the turns was also excellent, which was key to winning the gold medal.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-shen also said, "When we tested the wheels, we found the right ones for him, which gave him more confidence. We are very happy for him."</p>

            <h1>Ukrainian Immigrant Grows World's Tallest Sunflower, Shows Love for His Homeland</h1>
            <p>In Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA, a Ukrainian immigrant named Alex Babich grew a sunflower that reached about 11 meters (35 feet) tall. On September 10, it was confirmed to be the tallest sunflower in the world by Guinness World Records. The sunflower is Ukraine's national flower, so this flower shows his connection to his home country and his future family.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Alex Babich, who is 47 years old, moved to the United States in 1991 when he was 14. This was after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine. Seven years ago, he started growing sunflowers to show his love for his home country.</p>
            <p>Babich's first sunflower grew to about 4 meters (13 feet) tall. Later, one grew to about 4.5 meters (15 feet), and then another reached about 5.8 meters (19 feet). Soon, he started to wonder, "How tall can I make this grow?"</p>
            <p>Finally, Babich grew this sunflower in his backyard in Indiana. It was as tall as a utility pole. He said it took "years of trying and failing" to set this world record.</p>
            <p>Babich gave the world's tallest sunflower the nickname "Clover." This is because his 10-year-old son would climb a scaffold and place lucky four-leaf clovers on its leaves to bring it good luck.</p>
            <p>Babich described "Clover" as "one of my children." He said, "I take care of it outside every day."</p>
            <p>He also said, "I will pass away one day, but the story of this flower will continue. My children will tell this story to my grandchildren."</p>

            <h1>Cross-Strait Standard Dance Competition in Shanghai Shows the Style of Older Dancers</h1>
            <p>The second "Cross-Strait International Standard Dance Friendship Competition" happened today in Shanghai. Wang Hongzhi, a standard dance expert who brought this type of dance from Taiwan to China, said that most of the dancers in this competition were middle-aged and older. He thought this was very meaningful because earlier dance competitions in mainland China usually had only children and teenagers.</p>
            <p>The 2025 "Cross-Strait International Standard Dance Friendship Competition" took place on September 13 at the Xiangyuan Hilton Hotel in Shanghai. There were 156 dancers from Taiwan and 266 dancers from mainland China. Also, 40 judges from both sides were there. The competition started at 8 AM and continued until the evening.</p>
            <p>Wang Hongzhi, the standard dance expert who has worked in China for 35 years, said that this year's event was the second one and was bigger than the last. He also said that the dancers performed very well. He believes this event connects dance lovers from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, helps them share culture, and creates a good way for both sides to interact.</p>
            <p>Wang Hongzhi mentioned that Taiwan started standard dance earlier, but mainland China has made quick progress. Now, dancers from both sides have a similar skill level, so the competition was very strong.</p>
            <p>Wang Hongzhi also noticed that many dancers in this competition were middle-aged and older. This was interesting because previous competitions in mainland China mostly had children and teenagers. He said that standard dance is for everyone, regardless of age or gender, and he felt this competition was very important.</p>
            <p>The Yuen An Group, a company that has done business in mainland China for 32 years, organized this dance competition. The founder, Zhang Xiuyan, said that the event helps with exchange between the two sides and gives older dancers a chance to perform. This year, the event was supposed to be in Taipei, but it was difficult for many dancers to travel there, so it was held in Shanghai again. She said, "We still hope that, like the Twin City Forum, it can be held in Taiwan one year and Shanghai the next."</p>
            <p>Speaking about the Twin City Forum that will be held in Shanghai this year, Zhang Xiuyan said that unofficial exchange is still very important. She believes that exchange between the two sides can become deeper through the Twin City Forum. She also thinks that unofficial exchanges like this dance event, where people have fun and learn about each other, should continue to grow.</p>
            <p>The competition had different groups: teacher-student, senior/elite, parent-child, and city exchange. It mainly focused on senior dancers aged 45 and above, even up to over 60. In the parent-child group, a mother and daughter from Shanghai won first place.</p>
            <p>Zhang Sihan, an 11-year-old dancer from Shanghai, said she started learning Latin dance in kindergarten and has been doing it for six years. Her mother, Liu Yan, said she learned to dance just to join her daughter in the competition. She only studied for two weeks and then danced with her daughter, winning first place.</p>
            <p>When asked about the differences in this competition, Zhang Sihan said that the Taiwanese dancers were also very good and very friendly.</p>
