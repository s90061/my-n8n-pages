Amazon has unveiled a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to help businesses better manage their supply chains. The tool, named Supply Chain by Amazon (SCBA), offers features like predictive analytics to anticipate disruptions and automated inventory management. Amazon claims SCBA can help companies reduce costs, improve delivery times, and increase overall efficiency.

The system uses machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data, including weather patterns, economic indicators, and historical sales figures, to forecast potential problems. This allows businesses to proactively adjust their strategies and avoid costly delays or stockouts. Amazon is initially targeting larger enterprises, but plans to eventually offer scaled-down versions for smaller businesses. Critics have voiced concerns about Amazonâ€™s growing dominance in the supply chain sector, arguing that it could stifle competition and disadvantage smaller retailers.

**Paris Implements Car-Free Sundays in City Center**

Paris is now holding car-free Sundays in its central districts in an effort to reduce pollution and promote pedestrian and bicycle traffic. The initiative, which takes place on the first Sunday of each month, bans private vehicles from a large area encompassing iconic landmarks like the Louvre Museum and the Eiffel Tower. Only pedestrians, cyclists, and certain authorized vehicles are allowed.

The city government hopes the program will encourage residents and tourists to explore Paris in a more environmentally friendly way. Initial reactions have been largely positive, with many praising the quieter streets and improved air quality. Some business owners, however, have expressed concerns about potential disruptions to deliveries and reduced customer access. The city is monitoring the programâ€™s impact and considering expanding it to other areas in the future.

**Remote Work Trend Leads to "Digital Nomad" Visa Boom**

The rise of remote work has fueled a surge in "digital nomad" visas, offered by countries seeking to attract foreign workers who can contribute to the local economy while enjoying a new lifestyle. These visas typically allow individuals to live and work in a country for a year or more, provided they meet certain income requirements and have health insurance.

Countries like Portugal, Spain, and Costa Rica have become particularly popular destinations, offering appealing climates, affordable living costs, and strong internet infrastructure. The influx of digital nomads can bring economic benefits, such as increased spending in local businesses and a boost to the housing market. However, some communities are also grappling with the potential downsides, including rising rents and pressure on local resources. As remote work becomes increasingly prevalent, the competition for digital nomads is expected to intensify.
