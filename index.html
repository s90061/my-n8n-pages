            <h1>Israel Plans Full Control of Gaza City, UN Deeply Worried</h1>
            <p>Early this morning, Israel's security group approved a plan to fully control Gaza City. Even though many people inside and outside the country are criticizing the war, which has been going on for almost two years, Prime Minister Netanyahu had already said Israel wants to have military control over the whole Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>News reports from Reuters, AFP, and Bloomberg say that Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement. It said that as part of the plan to "defeat" Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces "will get ready to take control of Gaza City. At the same time, they will give help to people who are not in the war zone."</p>
            <p>The statement also said: "The security group voted to approve five rules to end the war. These rules are: take away Hamas's weapons, bring all hostages back, dead or alive, make the Gaza Strip free of military forces, Israel's control over the safety of the Gaza Strip, and create a new government that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority."</p>
            <p>The statement also mentioned that most members of the security group believe that "the other plans suggested by the government cannot defeat Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic group, nor can they bring the hostages back."</p>
            <p>Gaza City is in the northern part of the Gaza Strip and is the largest city there. The United Nations said that if reports about Israel possibly making its military actions bigger in Gaza are true, they would be "very worried."</p>
            <p>Two people from the Israeli government said that any decision by the security group needs to be approved by the full government. The full government might not meet until the 10th.</p>
            <p>Sources who did not want to be named said that before the security meeting, one idea they thought about was to take control of parts of Gaza that are not yet under military control, step by step.</p>
            <p>This source added that people in certain areas of Gaza might get warnings to leave. This would give them a few weeks to go before soldiers move in.</p>
            <p>Taking full control of Gaza would change Israel's decision from 2005. At that time, Israel took its citizens and soldiers out of Gaza. But it kept control over Gaza's borders, airspace, and public services.</p>
            <p>It is not clear yet if Netanyahu wants long-term control or a short-term action. Israel has said many times that its goal is to break up Hamas and free the hostages.</p>
            <p>Hamas said in a statement that Netanyahu's words were a "clear betrayal" of the talks between both sides.</p>
            <p>The statement also said: "Netanyahu's plan to make the attacks bigger clearly shows that he is trying to get rid of and give up on those who are held captive."</p>
            <p>An official from Jordan told Reuters that Arab countries "will only support what the Palestinians agree to and decide." He added that "a legal Palestinian group" should be in charge of safety in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The White House has not yet said anything about Israel possibly taking full military control of Gaza. U.S. President Trump did not say if he supports or is against it.</p>
            <p>The Israel Defense Forces now control about 75% of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have lost their homes, and their houses are now ruins. Gaza City is one of the areas hit by air attacks. But ground troops have mostly stayed away because Israelis believe Hamas is holding the remaining 50 hostages there. It is thought that 20 of these hostages are still alive.</p>

            <h1>El Al's Paris Office Sprayed with Red Paint, Israel Asks France to Punish</h1>
            <p>The entrance of El Al, an Israeli airline's office in Paris, was sprayed with red paint. Pro-Palestinian messages were also written on it. Today, Israel asked French officials to act against this "wild act."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that from last night to this morning, anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian words were written at the entrance of the El Al office. These included "Free Palestine" and "El Al Genocide Airline." The sidewalk was also covered in red paint.</p>
            <p>Miri Regev, Israel's Minister of Transportation, wrote on social media platform X: "I condemn this wild and violent act against El Al. I expect French police to find the people who did this and punish them strictly."</p>
            <p>Regev said this happened because French President Emmanuel Macron recently gave a "big gift" to Hamas, an armed Palestinian group. She was clearly talking about Macron's announcement last month that France would recognize a Palestinian state.</p>
            <p>Joshua Zarka, Israel's ambassador to France, visited the place. He called this damage a "terrorist act" that tried to "scare El Al employees and Israeli citizens, make them afraid, and make them feel unwelcome."</p>
            <p>Israeli TV channel N12 reported that El Al said no one was in the building when it happened. So, it did not put employees in danger.</p>
            <p>The company added: "El Al proudly shows the Israeli flag on the tail of its planes. It speaks against any kind of violence, especially actions that show hatred for Jewish people."</p>

            <h1>Mime Interprets Granny Tiger, Wild Kids Physical Theatre Performs at Culture Expo</h1>
            <p>The Wild Kids Physical Theatre performed the famous Taiwanese folk tale "Granny Tiger" using mime. This was part of the Culture Expo arranged by the Ministry of Culture. It was their first time performing in Japan. The show made Japanese adults and children very excited. Some children even said they learned more about Taiwan because of it.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture's "We TAIWAN: Taiwan Culture in Osaka - Kansai Expo" officially started last weekend. A picture book exhibition called "Taiwan Picture Books, We Like It!" was part of it, shown at the Children's Book Forest. It had 50 Taiwanese picture books with Japanese translations. People loved it. For example, some visitors were very surprised that every book had its story translated into Japanese. Also, Japanese parents brought their children to read together.</p>
            <p>Besides the picture book exhibition, there will also be performances for two weekends in a row. The Wild Kids Physical Theatre will perform first, from the 8th to the 10th. They will show "Mime Performance - Granny Tiger." After that, Bach Art will perform "Chamber Music feat. Reading Picture Books." This will turn the static books into lively shows.</p>
            <p>Yao Shang-te, the leader of Wild Kids, said he chose to bring "Granny Tiger" to Japan because he was scared of the Granny Tiger song when he was a child. But later, he found out that the story of "Granny Tiger" in picture books has many different versions.</p>
            <p>Yao Shang-te said that for this show, they chose the "Granny Tiger" version by Wang Chia-chen and Wang Chia-chu. He hopes that by using mime, which doesn't use scary language, children will remember Granny Tiger as cute.</p>
            <p>In the story, Granny Tiger wants to eat the little girl. But she is beaten by three magic bags that mice gave to the girl. Granny Tiger then runs back to the mountains and never dares to eat people again. During the live show, Yao Shang-te chose 6 children from the audience to play mice. They acted out the part where the magic bags scare Granny Tiger away.</p>
            <p>After today's show, the audience reacted very well. A pair of Japanese sisters, aged 4 and 5, told the staff that it was "very fun." They also said they learned more about Taiwan because of this event. Many Japanese adults were even more involved than the children. When the little mice attacked Granny Tiger, they also made attacking moves. When Granny Tiger ran away, they clapped and cheered.</p>
            <p>Yao Shang-te and his team said that the most important thing for them during live shows is how they interact with the audience. They change each show right away based on past experiences and what is happening at that moment. This is the Wild Kids Physical Theatre's first time performing in Japan. They are very excited to meet Japanese children and see their reactions.</p>
            <p>To go beyond language limits, the Wild Kids Physical Theatre changed their usual way of performing, which used language to help explain. This time, they will go back to pure mime, using only body movements, facial expressions, and sounds made by moving. Also, they specially used 3D technology to make a large new Granny Tiger mask. They also added special parts to the mask to make the whole show more lively.</p>
            <p>Ito Mayumi, the director of the Children's Book Forest, said that the story of "Granny Tiger" is similar to "Little Red Riding Hood" from the Brothers Grimm tales. Also, there are similar stories in Japan. So, choosing "Granny Tiger" will not feel strange to Japanese children. She believes they will be very excited about this story, which is both cute and a little bit scary.</p>
            <p>From August 15th to 17th, Bach Art and Taiwanese mothers from Osaka will perform "Chamber Music feat. Reading Picture Books" together. To visit the exhibition and join the activities, you must first apply to enter the "Children's Book Forest Nakanoshima" on its official website, as per the entry rules.</p>
