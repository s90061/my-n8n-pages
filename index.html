            <h1>Tainan Nan-hua Gets 350 Millimeters More Rain; Expert Wu Der-rong Says Central and Southern Taiwan Still Face Heavy Rain Risk</h1>
            <p>According to the weather agency, by 8 AM today, Tainan's Nan-hua District received the most rain, with 350 millimeters. Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that the southwest monsoon will bring many days of rain to central and southern Taiwan today and tomorrow. This area is on the side facing the wind.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration's information shows that by 8 AM today, Tainan City's Nan-hua District had the highest total rainfall at 350 millimeters. Other areas included Kaohsiung City's Jiaxian District with 243 millimeters and Pingtung County's Wutai Township with 201 millimeters.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column today that the latest European weather model shows the southwest monsoon will affect the area today and tomorrow. This means central and southern Taiwan will have many rainy days. The atmosphere is unstable, which will cause local showers or thunderstorms. These will bring a lot of rain that could cause damage. There is also a chance of small areas with strong weather, such as lightning, strong winds, and very heavy rain. The area affected will become larger in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Der-rong reminded people in mountain areas to be careful of landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides. People in low-lying areas should watch out for floods. Eastern Taiwan, which is on the other side of the wind, will not be affected as much, with only a few short periods of rain. When it does not rain, the weather will be hot and humid.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Der-rong pointed out that the newest European model shows the southwest monsoon will become weaker and move north on August 5th. This will change the pattern of many days with heavy rain. However, the air will still be unstable, and there might still be some heavy local rain. People in central and southern Taiwan need to be careful about how this rain affects possible disasters. From August 6th to 10th, the Pacific high-pressure system will cause sunny and very hot summer weather everywhere. In mountain areas, there might be occasional short rains in the afternoon. The highest temperature across Taiwan will go above 38 degrees Celsius. People should protect their skin from the sun and try not to get heatstroke.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Der-rong also said that the latest weather agency's "Typhoon Storm Area Probability Map" shows that the weak typhoon Krovanh is moving away quickly to the northeast of Japan. Another area of low pressure in the tropics is south of Japan. It is part of the monsoon weather system, and the wind changes a lot vertically, so it is developing slowly. It is expected to be named weak typhoon Bailu today. It will follow Krovanh to the northeast because of the southwest monsoon, and neither typhoon will affect Taiwan.

            <h1>Is a Monthly Rent of NT$70,000 Only Getting "Zombie Fortresses"? A Big Rent Fight in San Francisco</h1>
            <p>In the San Francisco Bay Area, high rent is not a new thing. Rent prices have been going up since the internet boom in the 1990s. They only went down a little during financial problems and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>About three years ago, when this reporter first came to San Francisco, the city was quiet because of the pandemic. Rent felt expensive, but it was not hard to find a place. There were all kinds of places to rent, like studios, apartments, townhouses, and single-family homes.</p>
            <p>However, lately, finding a good place to live in the San Francisco Bay Area is as hard as finding a good full-time job.</p>
            <p>Rebecca Hsu, a tech worker from Taiwan who finished school at UC Berkeley, is getting ready to move to San Francisco. She wants to find a room or studio with an elevator for $2,500 a month (about NT$75,000). But she found very few choices. For example, there were very old shared apartments on hills, or a few places in the Tenderloin area, which is known for homeless people and open drug dealing.</p>
            <p>She was surprised that an old shared apartment room in a far-off place, which only had space for a single bed and a desk and no closet, had four or five groups of people looking at it at the same time. It was rented out in just two days.</p>
            <p>She remembered the places in the Tenderloin area very well: "When I walked into that building, it felt like I was entering a zombie fortress."</p>
            <p>The competition for two-bedroom and three-bedroom places is even more intense. This reporter asked on social media groups about this, and many people replied.</p>
            <p>Sofia and her husband have one child. They want to find a two-bedroom apartment in a safer part of western San Francisco for less than $4,200 a month. They have to compete with tens of other people. To please the landlord, they even write very nice letters about themselves and include their resumes.</p>
            <p>Some people said that in the past, tech workers could easily find places to rent because they had good jobs. But now, the tech job market is not stable, so some landlords do not want to sign contracts with them. Others shared that even though four people together earned $350,000 a year, five landlords still said no to them.</p>
            <p>Tina, who has been a landlord in the San Francisco Bay Area for more than 20 years, told the reporter that in the past, she only heard about this kind of crazy situation when buying a house. "For renting, at most, houses would be rented out very quickly. But this is the first time I have heard of people offering to pay more money to get a place."</p>
            <p>Data from Apartment List, an online rental website, shows that the average apartment rent in San Francisco in June went up by 11% compared to last year. This was the highest increase in the whole United States. In the same time, the average rent across the US went down by 0.7%.</p>
            <p>Maggie Chien, a real estate agent in Silicon Valley, noticed that the demand for rentals in the San Francisco Bay Area has really gone up a lot recently. If landlords get new renters, the rent can go up by about 10%. If they let the old renters stay, the rent can go up by about 5%.</p>
            <p>Maggie Chien has many properties around Stanford University, which is about an hour's drive from San Francisco. She said that now, many people come to every house viewing. Two weeks ago, 30 people came to see a three-bedroom house that cost $5,000 a month. The number of applications for rentals is about three times what it was during the pandemic.</p>
            <p>She explained that one of the main reasons for the big increase in rental demand recently is that companies and schools have returned to working and learning in person.</p>
            <p>Also, the rising rates for home loans (mortgages) are having an effect. Eric Chang, who manages properties, said that if you buy a house near the Apple, Nvidia, or Google campuses, the total amount you have to pay each month is about three to four times more than the rent. In this time of high interest rates, paying off loans is very difficult, so more people might choose to rent and wait to buy later.</p>
            <p>The confused rental market also shows that industries are changing, and there is still a serious lack of housing in the area.</p>
            <p>The many different jobs in the San Francisco Bay Area are largely based on the technology industry. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now bringing new skilled workers and money into the area. At the same time, the biotechnology industry is quickly getting smaller after growing very fast before the pandemic. These big changes are causing a lot of movement in society.</p>
            <p>Also, about 85% of the land for homes in the San Francisco Bay Area only allows building single-family houses. Many areas also limit how tall buildings can be to 40 feet (about four floors). This means the land is not used very well.</p>
            <p>Over the past year or so, this reporter has started to see more apartment buildings being built. These buildings are only for renting, and their prices are set by the market.</p>
            <p>A recent survey by local news showed that San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has a very good approval rate of 73% after his first 100 days in office. However, on the important issue of "providing enough affordable housing," only 36% of people surveyed said they approved. This was the lowest score among all issues, showing that housing problems are a big challenge for the city.</p>
            <p>Rebecca Hsu looked at 15 places before she found a decent one. She said that in Taiwan, NT$20,000 (about US$650) could rent a good private studio in Taipei's Xinyi District. But in the San Francisco Bay Area, it often costs NT$80,000 (about US$2,600) easily.</p>
            <p>It is clear that as more and more tech workers start to feel pressure when trying to rent a place, the San Francisco rental market will become even more exclusive, mostly for people with higher incomes. (Editor: Chen Yen-chun) 20250803</p>

            <h1>Former Special Prosecutor Smith, Who Charged Trump, Will Be Investigated</h1>
            <p>US media reported today that US officials have started an investigation into Jack Smith, a former special prosecutor. Smith was in charge of two federal criminal cases against President Trump.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Office of Special Counsel told The New York Times that they are looking into whether Smith might have broken the "Hatch Act." This law stops government workers from doing political activities while they are at work.</p>
            <p>It was reported that Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, had asked the Office of Special Counsel to investigate Smith's actions. He wanted to know if Smith tried to affect the 2024 election.</p>
            <p>The Office of Special Counsel, which oversees how federal employees act, did not quickly reply to AFP's request for a comment.</p>
            <p>Smith was chosen as a special prosecutor in 2022. He accused Trump of planning to change the results of the 2020 election and of keeping secret documents improperly after he left office.</p>
            <p>Trump said both accusations were false. He claimed these actions were politically motivated and said that the Justice Department was being used as a weapon against him.</p>
            <p>In the end, neither of these cases went to trial. After Trump won the presidential election in November 2024, Smith dropped all the charges. This was because of a rule from the Justice Department that says they do not charge a sitting president.</p>
            <p>Smith resigned before Trump could do what he had promised during his campaign, which was to fire him.</p>
            <p>Under the Hatch Act, the most serious punishment is losing your job. But this rule does not apply to Smith because he has already resigned. (Translation: Chen Yu-ting/Review: Liu Wen-yu) 20250803</p>
