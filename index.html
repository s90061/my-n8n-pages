            <h1>Li Yu's "The Story of Wenzhou Street" Shows How Taipei People Lived and Their Strong Spirit</h1>
            <p>The first collection of short stories by the late writer Li Yu, called "The Story of Wenzhou Street," shows the lives and strong spirit of people in Taipei after 1949. This book has recently been published again.</p>
            <p>A book discussion event was held on September 6th at the "Tai Jing Nong Humanities Center" in Taipei. United Literature Publishing House organized it. Writer Yang Jia-xian gave the main talk, and Mei Jia-ling and Tang Juan introduced the event. During the event, they discussed parts of Li Yu's "The Story of Wenzhou Street" and her only long novel, "The Story of the Golden Monkey."</p>
            <p>Yang Jia-xian said that Li Yu's works seem calm on the surface, but inside, they are full of fear and the difficulties of a changing time. Li Yu liked to write about wars, including real battles. She also wrote about "love as a battlefield," "playing mahjong like a game of strategy," and "inner struggles." This reminds some people of another writer, Eileen Chang.</p>
            <p>Yang Jia-xian also said that Li Yu did not like Eileen Chang. Li Yu felt that Chang's characters always went downhill, and their times, lives, and spirits were very dark. Yang Jia-xian believes that even if Li Yu's stories are dark, her characters do not keep falling. They always have a strong spirit that lifts them up.</p>
            <p>Mei Jia-ling, a special professor at National Taiwan University, said that she often uses Li Yu's works in her classes. She has also included Li Yu's works in her collections of chosen stories, and many students have learned a lot from them. Mei Jia-ling also talked about the friendship between Li Yu's father and Tai Jing-nong. This friendship is seen in Li Yu's novels, which describe the pain and fear that cultural people felt after 1949. At the same time, her stories helped the next generation understand their own land.</p>
            <p>The poet Tang Juan spoke about Li Yu's deep interest in culture. He also talked about her "three-distance" style of writing, which includes deep, high, and flat perspectives. This style shows a unique, clear, poetic, and calm quality in her writing.</p>
            <p>Li Yu was born in Chongqing in 1944. In 1949, she moved to Taiwan with her family. She studied Foreign Languages at National Taiwan University. She earned a Ph.D. in Chinese Art History from the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States. While in the U.S., she and her husband, writer Kuo Sung-fen, took part in the Diaoyu Islands movement. In 1983, she won the China Times Literary Award. She then returned to writing and published a series of works, including "The Story of Wenzhou Street."</p>
            <p>The introduction to "The Story of Wenzhou Street" says that the book shows Li Yu's deep care for modern history. It describes the sadness of war and exile, and the people hurt by politics during the White Terror and the Cultural Revolution. It tells the sad story of how a generation of educated people faced trouble and had to move. It also looks for personal and group memories in a lost time and place.</p>

            <h1>A Person Dies After a Great White Shark Attack in Sydney; Drones Search Beaches</h1>
            <p>Government officials in Australia have said that a surfer died from a shark attack at a Sydney beach yesterday. Because of this, authorities today sent out drones and helicopters. They are watching the waters near two well-known beaches in Sydney to look for the great white shark.</p>
            <p>The event happened yesterday in northern Sydney, which is the main city of New South Wales. It was about 100 meters from Long Reef Beach. The man was surfing with his friends at the time.</p>
            <p>Police said that other friends pulled the experienced surfer out of the water. However, he had lost too much blood and died from his injuries right there.</p>
            <p>Sydney is the biggest city in Australia by population. After this shark attack, two beaches in the city stayed closed today.</p>
            <p>The last time a deadly shark attack happened at a Sydney beach was in February 2022. The first attack happened in 1963.</p>
            <p>The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) said that Surf Life Saving NSW, the main water rescue group in the state, sent out drones and helicopters today. They are checking the area to find the shark.</p>
            <p>The department also said in a statement that more "smart bait buoys" have been placed in the area. These buoys use satellite technology. They send a message to the authorities right away if a shark bites the bait.</p>
            <p>The department, which is looking into the case, said that government shark experts looked at pictures of the victim's surfboard. After this, "they believe the great white shark that caused the attack was about 3.4 to 3.6 meters long."</p>
            <p>According to official information from Sydney's Taronga Zoo, yesterday's incident was the fourth deadly shark attack in Australia this year. In March, a surfer died after a shark attack in shallow water at a faraway beach in Western Australia.</p>
            <p>Based on the International Shark Attack File from the University of Florida, Australia had the second-highest number of unprovoked shark attacks in 2024, after the United States.</p>

            <h1>OPEC+ Will Meet to Talk About Oil Production; People Are Watching to See if They Will Produce More</h1>
            <p>Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other important countries in OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies) will decide how much crude oil to produce at a meeting today. Experts say that the meeting's results are still not certain. They also say that it is possible they might decide to produce more oil.</p>
            <p>This meeting of the "Voluntary Eight," which are eight major oil-producing countries, is happening while oil prices keep falling. This is because people in the market expect there will be too much oil supply in the next few months.</p>
            <p>To keep oil prices from falling too much, OPEC+ has agreed to produce less oil many times in recent years. Together, they have reduced production by almost 6 million barrels per day.</p>
            <p>Since April, the V8 membersâ€”Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Omanâ€”have changed their plan. They are now focusing on getting back their share of the market. They have slowly agreed to a series of steps to increase oil production.</p>
            <p>One week ago, most experts thought that the V8 members would keep their oil production the same in October.</p>
            <p>Because oil-producing countries outside of OPEC+ are producing more oil, and taxes are lowering the demand, oil prices are now low. They are around 65 to 70 US dollars per barrel. This year, prices have fallen by 12%.</p>
