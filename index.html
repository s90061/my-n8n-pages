            <h1>Tainan Encourages Livestock Farms to Rebuild and Upgrade After Typhoon Damage</h1>
            <p>A typhoon called Danas caused damage to over 100 livestock farms in Tainan. The city's Agriculture Bureau looked into this. They found that farms with modern facilities were better able to handle the storm than old-style farms. So, the city is telling farm owners to use special aid money after the storm to make their farms better.</p>
            <p>Today, the Tainan City Agriculture Bureau invited two people to a press conference. They were Tseng Sheng-cheng, who leads the Pig Farmers Association, and Huang Bing-xun, who is in charge of the Egg Chicken Association. They shared how modern facilities helped their farms during the disaster.</p>
            <p>Ms. Xu Xing-jun, who is the head of the livestock section in the Agriculture Bureau, said that Tainan is the fourth biggest area for livestock in the country. It provides a lot of meat and eggs. She said that because of the typhoon and heavy rain, it might take up to six months for the supply of livestock products to return to normal.</p>
            <p>Ms. Xu also said that the Ministry of Agriculture has announced special help for livestock farms affected by Typhoon Danas and other heavy rains. This help can pay for new or fixed animal sheds, compost areas, offices, or storage places. It can also help with other farm equipment. The city government will help farmers apply for this money quickly so the farms can start producing again.</p>
            <p>Tseng Sheng-cheng said that his pig farm in Baihe changed to modern equipment earlier. This was part of a government plan to upgrade farms. Because of this, his farm had very little damage from the typhoon and is working normally now. He advises other farm owners to use this chance to change to the newest modern equipment. This will help their businesses last a long time.</p>
            <p>Huang Bing-xun said that his chicken farm in Yanshui also had modern equipment. This helped it survive the storm. Compared to other old-style chicken farms that were badly hit, his farm was "protected because it changed." He asked farm owners to use the help offered by the government.</p>
            <p>Ms. Xu explained that to make the farming industry stronger, the city government has helped farms with two plans. One is a four-year plan to help pig farms, and the other is a two-year plan to upgrade chicken farms. These plans have made farm management better, lowered labor costs, and made farms safer from diseases. They also help farms deal with bad weather and keep animals and equipment inside safe.</p>
            <p>She said that the Agriculture Bureau wants damaged farms that are rebuilding to also add environmentally friendly and energy-saving facilities. This will help them deal with very bad weather and become modern, lasting businesses.</p>

            <h1>Shihlin Electric: We Are Part of AI Data Centers; Some Orders Are Confirmed Until 2028</h1>
            <p>Today, Mr. Hsieh Han-chang, the CEO and General Manager of Shihlin Electric, a big power equipment company, said something important. He said that Shihlin Electric is involved in making parts for AI data centers that come in movable containers. They provide full power systems. Their transformers are selling well because of three main reasons. Some of their orders are already set until 2028.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsieh also talked about new areas the company is working on. Besides making equipment for advanced CoWoS packaging, they also help with cooling systems for AI servers. They work with other companies to provide parts like controllers and drivers.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Shihlin Electric had a meeting with investors. Mr. Hsieh talked about working with Tecom and Foxconn. He said that AI data centers using container-like parts are becoming popular. Big companies around the world are building these. Shihlin Electric has a lot of experience and is a main supplier of power equipment for these big companies' data centers in Taiwan. They are definitely part of this trend. They have also joined another group to provide full power systems for these container-type data centers.</p>
            <p>People in the industry say that Shihlin Electric helps big international companies like Amazon by providing power equipment for their data centers in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Looking at their main power businesses, like switchboards and transformers, Mr. Hsieh said that the transformer business grew a lot in the first half of this year. The switchboard business was stable. The main demand comes from Taiwan Power Company's plans to make the power grid stronger and replace old equipment. He thinks this will create a need for medium and large transformers for the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsieh explained that the growth of high-tech semiconductor factories in Taiwan has increased the demand for transformers. Shihlin Electric has 70% of the market share in this area. Also, Shihlin Electric sees good chances to sell to the United States market in the next 5 to 10 years. The US is their biggest market outside Taiwan. They also sell to other places like Canada, Southeast Asia, and Japan.</p>
            <p>When looking at the global transformer market, Mr. Hsieh noted that besides the US, Japan also has a very high demand. This is mainly because the AI industry needs more power equipment. Also, smart power grids are becoming common, and these need more stable power. Shihlin Electric is working hard to make the delivery time for their transformers shorter, aiming for 80 weeks. This is much faster than their competitors.</p>
            <p>Regarding changes in taxes on imported goods, Mr. Hsieh said that Shihlin Electric is talking to each customer. Even though the price has gone up, some customers are willing to pay all the extra tax, and some are willing to pay half.</p>
            <p>Looking at how far ahead their orders are, Mr. Hsieh said that some of Shihlin Electric's orders are confirmed until 2028. Orders for 2026 are definitely fine, and orders for 2027 are "almost certain."</p>
            <p>For new transformer factories, Shihlin Electric said that a new factory for large T3 power transformers will start making products in mid-September. This factory will focus on 500kV transformers. They are also planning a fourth new transformer factory, which they expect to finish planning by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>According to their data, in the first half of this year, power distribution products made up about 72% of Shihlin Electric's total sales. Car parts were about 14%, automatic equipment and parts were about 11%, and other products were about 3%. Currently, sales in the North American market are about 15% of their total business.</p>

            <h1>Chiayi County Greenhouses Damaged by Typhoon; Agriculture Department Connects Farmers with Companies for Removal</h1>
            <p>In early July, Typhoon Danas damaged 2,938 greenhouses and net houses in Chiayi County. This covered an area of 961 hectares. Today, the Agriculture Department said it has found 19 companies to help farmers remove the damaged structures. The Environmental Protection Bureau is also helping to clear away old farm plastic. This will help farmers start growing again sooner.</p>
            <p>It has been a month since the typhoon, but fallen greenhouses can still be seen everywhere in Chiayi County. Ms. Lee Chiu-ying, who leads the farming section of the Agriculture Department, told the Central News Agency that the county government has a list of 19 companies that can remove the damaged structures. Farmers can ask these companies for help. If the iron parts of the greenhouses can be recycled by the company, farmers might not need to pay. However, if the recycled iron is not worth enough to cover the removal cost, farmers will still need to pay.</p>
            <p>Also, the Environmental Protection Bureau is helping farmers take away old farm plastic and nets damaged by the typhoon. But farmers must sort the plastic by type, tie it up, and fold it neatly. This makes it easier to process and use again later.</p>
            <p>Ms. Lee said that the Ministry of Agriculture has a plan to help farmers rebuild greenhouses damaged by Typhoon Danas in 2025. This plan gives money to farmers. As of August 20th, local farmers' associations in Chiayi County have received 465 applications to rebuild greenhouses. 135 of these applications are already finished.</p>
            <p>Wu Shih-yen, a farmer from Taibao City, said that he just found a company to remove his damaged greenhouse. Because so many greenhouses were damaged, it took more than a month for his turn to come. He has already applied to the government to rebuild his greenhouse in a different place.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu said that to rebuild a greenhouse, he first needs to pay 20% of the cost as a deposit to the company. The cost of building a greenhouse can be millions to tens of millions of New Taiwan dollars, depending on its size. Many farmers find it hard to get this deposit money, and he is one of them.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Wu said he had greenhouses on 9 "fen" of land. More than 4 "fen" of his greenhouses fell down in the typhoon. He feels lucky that he still has half of his land to farm. Some farmers lost everything, and they truly have nothing left but sadness.</p>
