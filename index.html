**New York Mayor Democratic Primary: Mamdani Wins Majority**

After three rounds of counting votes, Zohran Mamdani, a New York State Assembly member, has become the Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York City. He won with more than half of the votes. If other candidates who are not as liberal cannot agree on one person to run, Mamdani, who is very popular, might become New York City's first Muslim mayor in November.

Mamdani announced on Facebook that he got 56% of the votes in the third round. This was more than his main competitor, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who got 44%. This means Mamdani has won the Democratic nomination. The Associated Press (AP) also confirmed that Mamdani won the primary election.

Mamdani, who is 33 years old, is from Uganda with Indian roots. He moved into politics six years ago as a state assembly member. He calls himself a democratic socialist. His campaign focuses on the high cost of living in New York City. He wants to make living more affordable. His ideas include stopping rent increases for some apartments, building affordable housing, and providing free public buses and early education for children.
