            <h1>Recall Movement in Taitung Helps Public Awareness Grow, Shows New Political Sides</h1>
            <p>Taitung (CNA) The recall case in Taitung has made local people more aware of civic duties. Not only have young people joined in, but also many people who were not involved in politics before, like doctors, university teachers, cultural workers, and foreign missionaries, have come forward. They are now at the front line, showing a new way for people to be involved in politics.</p>
            <p>The recall activities lasted for six months. Besides political parties and politicians, many new faces appeared. Sometimes, one person stood on the street holding a sign. Sometimes, a group of volunteers greeted people in the rain. Some even spoke on stage. This was very different from noisy election events in the past, showing a new kind of public action.</p>
            <p>Hung Tsung-kai, who is now the head of the Eastern Joint Services Center of the Executive Yuan and ran for Taitung mayor twice for the Democratic Progressive Party, said that many young people he had never seen at election events before were part of this recall movement. Even the members of the recall office often did not know each other. The volunteers who spoke and took part in activities were different each time, showing wide and natural support from the public.</p>
            <p>Chen Chia-pin, the co-leader and spokesperson for this recall case, owns a convenience store. He had never been involved in politics before, but he decided to go out and become one of the main people making the movement happen.</p>
            <p>It was not just young people. Foreign monks, university professors, doctors, and bookstore owners also came out to ask people to vote, showing that people from many different areas were waking up to their civic responsibilities.</p>
            <p>Father Augustin Olbert, an 89-year-old monk from the Bethlehem Mission Society who has become a Taiwanese citizen, said when he signed up for the second stage of the recall that Taiwan is his home. Even though he was weak, he had to stand up for his home. He voted yesterday afternoon and said he was very happy and grateful to be able to vote in Taiwan. He mentioned that in Switzerland, voting is a duty, and if you don't vote, you get a fine. He said, "Good citizens should care about their country's matters. They cannot ignore things, so they must vote. It is our responsibility."</p>
            <p>Liu Han-ting, the head of Hematology and Oncology at Taitung Christian Hospital, rarely took part in political activities in public before. After the recall case entered its second stage in March this year, he started to ask people on social media to sign up. From April, he also went out to speak on the streets and spoke at small public gatherings. He said that if he only focused on his hospital work and did nothing for society, "that would be a debt to God."</p>
            <p>Professor Tseng Shih-chieh, who used to be the vice president of National Taitung University and the dean of the College of Education, wrote letters and posted on Facebook asking his students to "help me complete my retirement gift - join the second stage of signing." After he joined the civic action, his social media followers quickly increased by 1,500 people. He told a CNA reporter that Dr. Jane Goodall, a famous conservationist from the UK, once told him, "When everyone works together, they can make a change." He strongly believes that small drops of water will eventually become a big flow, changing Taiwan and also Taitung. (Editor: Huang Shih-ya) 1140727</p>
