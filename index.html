            <h1>Ukraine Factory Attacked by Drones; Poland Says Russia Attacked on Purpose</h1>
            <p>A factory in Ukraine was attacked by Russian drones on July 15th. This factory belongs to Barlinek Group, a company from Poland that makes wooden floors. Six people were hurt, and two of them were badly injured. Poland said Russia attacked on purpose, targeting people who are not soldiers. Poland also said this shows that the war between Russia and Ukraine is getting closer to the Polish border.</p>
            <p>The attack happened on the evening of July 15th. Russia sent many drones into Ukraine. Poland's Foreign Minister, RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski, wrote on social media that Russian drones attacked the Barlinek Group factory in Vinnytsia. He quoted the factory manager, who said, "This was an attack done on purpose from three sides at the same time."</p>
            <p>PaweÅ‚ WroÅ„ski, who speaks for Poland's Foreign Ministry, told Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper that five drones attacked the factory from different directions. He said, "This shows it was not a mistake. It was clearly an attack on a place for normal people."</p>
            <p>On July 16th, the prosecutor's office in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, announced that they have started an investigation into this attack by Russia on a civilian factory. They are looking into it as a war crime.</p>
            <p>Barlinek Group is a well-known company from Poland that makes wooden floors. They sell their products to 75 countries around the world. According to Polish Business Insider, about 40% of Barlinek's products are made at the Vinnytsia factory, which opened in 2007. The company also has two other factories, one in Poland and one in Romania.</p>
            <p>This is not the first time Russian forces have attacked a Polish company's building in Ukraine. In September 2023, a factory in Ukraine belonging to Fakro, a Polish company that makes windows, was also hit by Russian rockets. At that time, the damage was about 7 million Euros, which is around 239 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Poland's Foreign Minister, RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski, said strongly, "Russian President Vladimir Putin's bad war is getting closer to our border."</p>

            <h1>Former US Ambassador: Taiwan's Plan to Grow Drone Power Will Make Beijing Hesitate</h1>
            <p>Nicholas Burns, who used to be the US Ambassador to China, said today that he believes China will hesitate to act. He said this because he saw how Ukraine is fighting against Russia's much larger army. He also saw that Taiwan is thinking about making many more drones and attack missiles by itself.</p>
            <p>Today, Nicholas Burns spoke at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. He was a speaker in a discussion about "Charting a Course in the Indo-Pacific," which means setting a path for strategy in that area.</p>
            <p>People at the meeting asked how the war in Ukraine and other events might change China's plans for Taiwan. Burns, who is now a leader of the Aspen Strategy Group, answered. He said that seeing Ukraine fight against a much bigger army, and seeing Taiwan consider making many more drones and attack missiles, will surely make China hesitate. He added, "This is a good thing."</p>
            <p>Burns also said that when he was the US Ambassador to China during President Biden's time, former President Biden successfully convinced Japan to make its own defense stronger. He also saw that the topic of "what happens to Taiwan" became a main point of discussion about safety in Japan and the Philippines. Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also warned other countries that if the Taiwan Strait were blocked, it could cause big problems for the world's economy.</p>
            <p>Burns believes that "this pressure on China is a good thing." He thinks that the Trump government needs to be careful about this situation.</p>
            <p>Also at the same forum, Kevin Rudd, who used to be the Prime Minister of Australia, said that Taiwan is now very important for China's army strategy. He said, "If Taiwan falls, China's military power will grow even more. We must think about these problems very carefully." He believes that "this idea is becoming popular in the United States and among its friends."</p>
            <p>In recent years, China has often put military pressure on Taiwan and held special military drills. The situation in the Taiwan Strait is watched closely by the whole world. News reports say that Romeo Brawner Jr., the head of the Philippine military, said in April that if Taiwan, which is close by, is "attacked," the Philippines "cannot avoid" being part of the fight.</p>
            <p>Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, also gave a speech in Okinawa earlier this month. He was helping a candidate from his party, the Liberal Democratic Party. He said that because China's military activities around Taiwan are increasing, everyone must think about how to deal with it.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Man Caught in Guatemala for Money Laundering, Will Go to US for Trial</h1>
            <p>Police in Guatemala recently arrested a Chinese man who they believe was involved in money laundering. They started the process to send him to the United States because the US asked them to. The man is accused by US justice officials of taking money from drug sales and using international money laundering to send it back to drug groups in Mexico.</p>
            <p>On July 17th, Guatemala's Ministry of Justice released a statement. It said that working with the national police, they successfully arrested a Chinese man named Wenshen Xu. They also found out that he used other names like Alex, Alex Xiu, Alex Tsui, and Chino.</p>
            <p>Mr. Xu is now held in Guatemala. The United States has formally asked for him to be sent to the Eastern District Federal Court in Virginia, USA, for a trial. In the US, Mr. Xu is accused of three crimes: planning to launder money, hiding money from crimes, and helping to hide where illegal money went.</p>
            <p>US investigations show that Mr. Xu was part of a large money laundering group that worked across China, the US, Mexico, Colombia, and other countries. This group helped drug criminals "wash" money they made from selling drugs like cocaine. His job was to collect cash from drug sales inside the US. Then, he used different ways to make the money seem "legal." Finally, he sent it back to bank accounts controlled by the drug groups in Mexico.</p>
            <p>Previous reports from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that Mexican drug money laundering groups are using Chinese underground financial systems more and more. They also use cryptocurrency trades and pretend to be real businesses. They do this to avoid rules about money in different countries.</p>
            <p>Guatemala's Ministry of Justice said again that they promise to fight crime that crosses borders. This is especially true for crimes like money laundering and drug dealing. They will keep working with other countries through international legal help to fight crime.</p>
            <p>Right now, the case to send Mr. Xu to the US is being looked at by the courts. After the court makes its decision, he will be given to the US to be tried there, as the law says. The police in Guatemala are keeping many details secret. They have not said where he was caught or where he is being held now.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the US and countries in Central and South America have worked together more to fight crime that crosses borders. Drug smuggling and money laundering often involve laws from many countries. So, it is hard for police and legal departments in different countries to work together quickly and easily.</p>
            <p>Guatemalan news reports say that the US court will look into more details about how Mr. Xu laundered money using methods common in Chinese underground banking. Also, legal groups in different countries should pay attention to whether these big drug money laundering groups are growing and reaching other countries in Latin America.</p>
