            <h1>Trump: US Wants to Get Back Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that the United States is trying to get back Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. He also criticized how the government of former President Biden left Afghanistan in 2021, calling it messy.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump spoke at a press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump said the US gave up the base for no good reason. He added, "We are trying to get it back."</p>
            <p>In the past, Trump has said that Bagram Base is very important because it is close to the border between Afghanistan and China. Earlier this month, he also said that Biden's government was "very foolish" to pull US troops out of the base in 2021.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, at today's press conference, Trump also said that one reason the US wants the base back is because it is only "1 hour" away from where China makes nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump also suggested that he might use what the US government has to get Bagram Base back from the Taliban, who now control Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters, "We are trying to get the base back because they need things from us. We hope to get that base back."</p>

            <h1>UK May Recognize Palestine, Trump Disagrees with UK Prime Minister</h1>
            <p>After talking about the war in Gaza, US President Trump said today that he does not agree with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This is about the UK's plan to recognize Palestine as a country.</p>
            <p>It was Trump's second day visiting the UK. He held a press conference with Starmer at Chequers Court, the Prime Minister's official home. Trump said, "On this point, I disagree with the Prime Minister. It is one of the few things we disagree on."</p>
            <p>In July, Starmer announced that if Israel does not agree to a ceasefire in Gaza and other conditions, the UK will work to recognize Palestine at the UN General Assembly in September.</p>
            <p>At today's press conference, Starmer and Trump mostly showed that they agreed on things, except for a few points like the Palestinian state.</p>
            <p>France, Canada, and other Western countries plan to take action at the United Nations next week. However, the United States has strongly said no to countries recognizing Palestine as a country.</p>
            <p>Starmer said that during their talks, they also discussed the worsening situation in Gaza. Both agreed that "peace must happen, and a clear plan must be made."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I want this war to end, and I want the hostages to be set free."</p>
            <p>Trump called the war in Gaza "a difficult situation." But when reporters asked many times if he would tell his friend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to stop bombing Gaza, Trump did not answer directly.</p>
            <p>Starmer said the situation in Gaza is "unacceptable." He also said, "We must get help into Gaza faster."</p>
            <p>He added that recognizing Palestine as a country should be part of a bigger "peace plan." This plan also needs to make sure that Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, cannot be part of a new government. But Starmer did not say when the UK would officially recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>British media said today that before the UN meeting, Starmer might decide on the final plan to recognize Palestine as early as this weekend.</p>

            <h1>Ukrainian Soldiers Attack in the East, Take Back 7 Villages, and Capture 100 Russian Soldiers</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian soldiers recently started a new attack in the east. They have successfully taken back 7 villages and more than 160 square kilometers of land. They also made Russia's plans to attack in the Donetsk region weaker.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy shared on social media that the attack is mainly happening around Pokrovsk and Dobropillia in the Donetsk region. The fighting there is strong. According to a report from the head of Ukraine's army, Oleksandr Syrskyi, over 100 Russian soldiers have been captured since the attack began. More than 1,300 Russian soldiers have died in the Pokrovsk area.</p>
            <p>Recently, Zelenskyy went to the front lines in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine to see the troops. He said that Ukrainian soldiers have made it harder for Russia to start a big attack there. He also asked other countries to put more rules on Russia. This would help Ukraine use its army power and long-range weapons to make Russia seek peace.</p>
            <p>Between July and August, Russian soldiers attacked more strongly in places like Pokrovsk, Dobropillia, and Myrnohrad. The US research group "Institute for the Study of War" (ISW) said that on August 12, Russian soldiers took about 110 square kilometers of land in one day. This was their biggest gain in over a year.</p>
            <p>However, last week, Ukraine's Azov Regiment released a video. It showed them capturing 17 Russian soldiers near Dobropillia. They also said that they and other groups captured 69 soldiers in total. From public information, it looks like Russia's attacks have slowed down recently.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Zelenskyy warned during an interview with Sky News in the UK that Russia is getting ready for two big attacks.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that US officials shared that Russian President Vladimir Putin told Washington he plans to fully control the entire Donbas region in 2 to 3 months.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's last big public attack was in the summer of 2023. At that time, they tried to cut off Russia's supply line from the southeast to Crimea, but they did not succeed. Some people think that Ukraine talked too much about their attack and did not realize how well Russia had prepared its defenses. This made the attack fail.</p>
            <p>After that, Ukraine's army became less active on the front lines. The government also used the word "counter-offensive" less often. In 2024, Ukrainian soldiers attacked Russia's Kursk region, which again got international attention. But the situation in eastern Ukraine is still very difficult, and Russian soldiers have taken several places.</p>
