            <h1>Chinese-Made Training Plane Crashes into School in Bangladesh Capital, 19 Dead, Over 100 Injured</h1>
            <p>On July 21, a training plane made in China crashed into a school in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. Firefighters said that at least 19 people died. The government of Bangladesh also reported that more than 100 people were hurt in the accident.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that officials stated the crash happened at Milestone School and College, which is in the Uttara area, north of Dhaka.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the Chinese-made F-7 BGI training plane crashed shortly after taking off at 1:06 PM local time (3:06 PM Taiwan time).</p>
            <p>Videos taken at the crash site showed a big fire near a grassy area. Thick smoke went high into the sky, and many people watched from a distance.</p>
            <p>Reuters TV showed images where the plane seemed to hit the side of a building, making a large hole and damaging iron windows. Firefighters sprayed water on the broken plane parts.</p>
            <p>Dhaka Medical College Hospital took in some of the injured people. Bidhan Sarker, head of the hospital's burn unit, said, "A third-grade student was already dead when brought in, and three other injured people, aged 12, 14, and 40, were brought to this hospital."</p>
            <p>TV images also showed people screaming and crying at the accident site, while others tried to calm them down.</p>
            <p>Masud Tarik, a teacher at the school where the accident happened, said, "When I went to pick up my child at the school gate, I noticed something coming from behind... I heard an explosion, turned around, and only saw fire and smoke."</p>
            <p>Muhammad Yunus, the leader of Bangladesh's interim government, said that they will take "necessary actions" to investigate why the accident happened and "make sure all kinds of help are given."</p>

            <h1>Jeju Air Crash Investigation Suggests Pilots Turned Off Wrong Engine; Families and Pilots Are Unhappy</h1>
            <p>On July 21, sources familiar with the crash investigation revealed that there is "clear evidence" that the pilots of Jeju Air, a Korean airline, turned off the engine that was less damaged after a bird strike. This accident happened last December and killed 179 people. The investigation is led by South Korea.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that sources said the cockpit voice recorder, computer data, and physical evidence from the engine switches found in the plane wreckage show something important. The pilots took emergency steps after hitting a bird shortly before they were supposed to land. They turned off the left engine instead of the right one.</p>
            <p>The sources told Reuters, "The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so the investigation's conclusion will not change." The sources did not want to be named because the investigators have not yet released an official report with this evidence.</p>
            <p>A government official said that checking the airplane engines that were found showed no problems before the bird strike and the crash.</p>
            <p>On December 29 last year, a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 plane crashed at Muan International Airport. All but two of the 181 people on board died. This was the worst plane crash in South Korea's history.</p>
            <p>According to a third source who was at a briefing, investigators told the families of the victims on July 19 that the bird strike badly damaged the right engine. They also said there was indirect evidence that the pilots turned off the left engine, which was less damaged.</p>
            <p>Korean news groups, including MBN TV and Yonhap News Agency, reported this information on July 19 and 20.</p>
            <p>On July 19, South Korean investigators canceled a press conference where they were supposed to give updates on the engine investigation.</p>
            <p>Lawyers for the victims' families said that the families were told about the report before the press conference was planned. However, they are against releasing it because the report seems to blame the pilots but does not look into other reasons for the crash.</p>
            <p>The crashed Jeju Air plane went off the runway at Muan International Airport during an emergency landing. It hit a concrete wall that held navigation equipment. This caused the plane to catch fire and have some explosions.</p>
            <p>Representatives for the victims' families and the Jeju Air pilots' union said over the weekend that the investigation should focus on the concrete wall itself. Aviation experts believe the concrete wall might be the main reason for the many deaths and injuries.</p>
            <p>The Jeju Air pilots' union stated that the Korea Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) is "misleading the public." This is because ARAIB says the left engine had no problems, even though bird remains were found in both engines.</p>
            <p>The pilots' union claims that ARAIB has not provided scientific or technical proof that the plane could land safely with only the left engine. They say ARAIB is trying to make the pilots a "scapegoat."</p>
