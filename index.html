            <h1>Army Uses Special Systems to Help Hualien Disaster Relief</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, September 29) A lake formed by a landslide, called a "landslide dam lake," overflowed in Hualien's Matai'an River, causing a disaster. The Army announced today that it has sent 2,500 soldiers to help with the rescue efforts. To make sure the rescue work is effective, the Second Combat Zone sent out mobile digital microwave and satellite systems. These systems can connect to regular cell phones, police and fire radios, and low-earth orbit satellites. This helps communication and control work smoothly all day long.</p>
            <p>The Army Headquarters said in a press release tonight that the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Combat Zones continue to help Hualien recover. They have sent about 2,500 soldiers and 472 pieces of equipment from 13 different types for recovery work after the disaster. They hope to help people in the disaster area return to normal life before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
            <p>The Army also said that the forward command post for the rescue is working hard on the rescue plans and schedule. They have also prepared everything needed for soldiers from other areas, such as rotating staff, food, housing, and transport. This helps speed up the recovery process. While soldiers are working hard, leaders are asked to make sure the soldiers are well taken care of. They should check on their physical and mental health. Also, by giving people proper time for work and rest, the overall rescue effort will be better.</p>
            <p>The Army explained, "Operations depend on command, and command depend on communication." Disaster relief is like an operation, so keeping communication and command open 24 hours a day is very important. To make sure rescue efforts work best in the shortest time, the communication team from the Second Combat Zone sent out mobile digital microwave and satellite systems. These systems provide old-style and internet phone services. They can connect to regular cell phones, radios used by police and fire departments, and special low-earth orbit satellites. This keeps information and command flowing smoothly all day.</p>
            <p>Also, the Army has given out all-frequency radios. These help commanders on the front lines in the disaster area to talk with police, firefighters, and rescue groups right away. This connects military and civilian communication systems, making sure orders and information are sent quickly. This helps the forward command post get information about the disaster quickly and accurately. It also helps them organize rescue workers, equipment, and other resources better.</p>
            <p>The Army stated that to help volunteers move around, the command center's transport unit gathered vehicles from the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Combat Zones. They sent 3.5-ton trucks to pick up and drop off volunteers and deliver meals. So far, they have made 39 trips and helped 897 people.</p>
            <p>The Army emphasized that they will keep sending more soldiers for disaster relief as needed by local governments. They will speed up the recovery work and make sure the safety and well-being of the soldiers on the front lines are taken care of. This will keep the rescue teams in the best condition. They will work together with local governments and people to quickly help the disaster area recover and help those affected return to a stable life.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs: Diverting Matai'an Stream is to Make the River Stable, Not to Confuse with Landslide Dam Lake</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, September 29) The landslide dam lake in Hualien's Matai'an Stream caused serious floods in Guangfu Township. Some people asked why the riverbanks of Matai'an Stream were broken and not fixed. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the riverbanks were already fixed. The main reason for the disaster this time was that too much water flowed over the riverbanks, more than they were designed to hold. It was not a problem with the riverbanks themselves. The purpose of diverting the water is to make the river flow steadily. Also, the place where they are doing the diversion work is different from where the landslide dam lake is. So, people should not mix them up on purpose.</p>
            <p>The flood from the landslide dam lake in Hualien's Matai'an Stream caused a big flood in the downstream urban area of Guangfu. The riverbanks in Guangfu Township were also washed away for 2 kilometers. After two days of hard work, the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs successfully changed the path of the Matai'an Stream water that was flowing into the city. They led it into a deep channel this morning.</p>
            <p>About the questions that the Matai'an Stream riverbanks were broken and not fixed, the Ministry of Economic Affairs posted on Facebook today. They said that the Guangfu No. 2 and No. 3 riverbanks were already fixed by the Water Resources Agency before the typhoon. The main reason for this disaster was that too much water flowed over the riverbanks, more than they were made to hold. It was not a problem with the riverbanks themselves.</p>
            <p>Regarding why the landslide dam lake was not dealt with before if the water could be diverted, the Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out that the locations are completely different. The area where the diversion work is happening is the Guangfu section on the right side of the lower Matai'an Stream. Its purpose is to make the river flow steadily. The landslide dam lake is in the upper part of the Matai'an Stream where there are no roads. People should not confuse these two things on purpose.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that today, the water from Matai'an Stream was successfully guided into a deep channel this morning. This helps to lower the risk of floods. After this, they will start full recovery and dredging work.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs thanked the hardworking staff and teams on the front lines who are doing rescue and repair work. They used 151 pieces of equipment and over 200 people to build an earth dam. This reduced the risk of flooding and protected the safety of the people.</p>
