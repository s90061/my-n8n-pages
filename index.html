Apple has announced new artificial intelligence (AI) features for its iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. These new tools, called "Apple Intelligence," are designed to make using devices easier and more personal. They will help users with many daily tasks, making their digital life more productive.

The AI features can assist with writing by checking grammar and suggesting better ways to phrase sentences. Users can also ask the AI to summarize long articles or emails quickly. For creative tasks, the AI can generate unique images from simple text descriptions, which can be useful for communication or just for fun. Siri, Apple's voice assistant, will also become much smarter. It will understand requests better and be able to help with tasks across different apps, such as finding a specific photo or scheduling an event.

A key part of Apple's new AI is its focus on privacy. Many of the AI processes happen directly on the device, meaning personal data does not need to be sent to the cloud. For more complex tasks that require cloud computing, Apple says it uses secure servers that protect user information. These advancements show how technology continues to change the way people live and work every day.

**Venice Starts New Fee for Day-Trippers**

The popular Italian city of Venice has introduced a new fee for day visitors. From now on, people who visit Venice for just one day will need to pay â‚¬5 (about $5.40). This new rule is part of the city's efforts to control the large number of tourists and protect its historical center.

The aim of the fee is to make tourism more sustainable and improve the quality of life for local residents. Venice has faced problems like overcrowded streets and damage to its buildings because of too many visitors, especially during peak seasons. The city hopes this fee will help manage the flow of tourists and encourage more visitors to stay longer, which also helps the local economy.

Not everyone has to pay the fee. People who live in Venice, those who stay overnight in hotels, and children under 14 are exempt. Visitors who need to pay must book their visit online and receive a QR code, which they might be asked to show at certain entry points. This change is a significant step in how popular cultural destinations manage tourism in the modern world.

**The Ongoing Debate: Working from Home or Office?**

The way people work continues to change, and many companies and employees are still discussing the best balance between working in the office and working from home. After the pandemic, a hybrid model, where people work some days in the office and some days remotely, became very popular. However, many companies are now asking employees to spend more days at their desks in the office.

Businesses often want employees back in the office to encourage better teamwork and strengthen company culture. They believe that face-to-face meetings lead to more creative ideas and stronger relationships among colleagues. For many companies, having a vibrant office environment is seen as important for building a strong sense of community.

On the other hand, employees often prefer the flexibility and convenience of working from home. They can save time and money by avoiding daily commutes and find it easier to manage their daily lives. Many workers have found that remote work allows them to focus better on tasks without interruptions. Finding a solution that makes both employers and employees happy is a big challenge for businesses today, affecting daily routines and city life.`;
