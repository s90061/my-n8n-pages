The New York Times reports that new high tariffs from the United States are expected. However, countries like India, the European Union, Taiwan, and Japan might still make trade agreements to avoid some of these taxes. Even with agreements, US tariffs could still increase a lot. Important industries like semiconductors and medicine might face special tariffs by the end of the month. US tariff revenue has already reached 100 billion US dollars this fiscal year.

**Trump Gives Russia 50 Days for Ceasefire, EU Foreign Minister Says It's Too Long**

US President Trump stated that if Russia does not agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine within 50 days, the US will impose very strict tariffs. However, the EU Foreign Minister, Kaja Kallas, said that while she welcomes Trump's firm stance, 50 days is a long time given that innocent civilians are being killed daily. It was clarified later that Trump likely meant "secondary sanctions" instead of "secondary tariffs." These sanctions would involve targeting countries that continue to trade with Russia.

**Trump Plans Secondary Sanctions on Russia Targeting Energy Buyers, China and India Most Affected**

US President Trump announced that if Russia does not reach a ceasefire agreement in 50 days, the US will impose "secondary tariffs." This actually refers to "secondary sanctions" which would target countries buying Russian energy. If these sanctions are put in place, China and India, who are the biggest buyers of Russian oil, would be hurt the most. Many banks and financial institutions already avoid trading with Russia because they fear US secondary sanctions. India buys 35% of its crude oil from Russia, and China buys 19%.
