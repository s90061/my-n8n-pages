            <h1>Election Commission: Nuclear Power Plant Referendum Cost 1.14 Billion, 31 Recall Cases Cost 400 Million</h1>
            <p>The Central Election Commission announced today the costs for the 31 recall cases for lawmakers and 1 referendum on restarting the third nuclear power plant. The events happened on July 26 and August 23. Because the referendum and recall cases overlapped, they could save money. The referendum cost about NT$1.14 billion, and the 31 recall cases for lawmakers cost about NT$402.8 million.</p>
            <p>Seven Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers had recall votes today: Lo Ming-tsai, Lin Szu-ming, Yen Kuan-heng, Yang Chiung-ying, Chiang Chi-chen, Ma Wen-chun, and Yu Hao. The votes were counted right after the polls closed. Including the 24 KMT lawmakers and the suspended Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an who faced recall votes on July 26, all 32 recall cases were rejected.</p>
            <p>Also, the referendum to restart the third nuclear power plant did not pass. There were 4,341,432 votes for it, which was more than the 1,511,693 votes against it. However, the "for" votes did not reach the required 1/4 threshold of 5,000,523 votes to pass.</p>
            <p>Regarding the election costs, the Central Election Commission said today that each regional lawmaker recall case was estimated to cost about NT$16 million to NT$20 million. But because the referendum on August 23 and some parts of the recall elections on July 26 and August 23 happened at the same time, they saved money.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission stated that the referendum to restart the third nuclear power plant cost about NT$1.14 billion. The 24 lawmaker recall cases on July 26 cost about NT$345.8 million, and the 7 lawmaker recall cases on August 23 cost about NT$57 million.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission also said that the recall case for Kao Hung-an on July 26 cost about NT$31.01 million. By law, this money comes from the local government's budget. This means the Hsinchu City Government had to pay for it, not the central government.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang: We will continue to work together on policies that benefit the country and people, no matter who leads the KMT.</h1>
            <p>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Chu Li-luan asked Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to take over as party leader tonight. In response, Taiwan People's Party (TPP) Chairman Huang Kuo-chang said tonight that no matter if Chu Li-luan, Lu Shiow-yen, or other good people become the KMT chairman, he hopes the KMT and TPP can continue to work together on policies and laws that help the country and its people, without focusing on party differences.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang held a press conference tonight with TPP leaders. They talked about the results of the referendum on restarting the third nuclear power plant and the recall votes for seven KMT lawmakers.</p>
            <p>About Chu Li-luan asking Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to take on the important role of KMT chairman, Huang Kuo-chang said he respects how other parties choose their leaders.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the TPP highly respects and wishes well for whoever will lead the KMT next. He also believes that the KMT will follow its own democratic rules to choose the best person.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang stated that the TPP hopes that no matter if Chu Li-luan, Lu Shiow-yen, or other talented individuals become the KMT chairman, they can continue to work together and move forward on policies and laws that benefit the country and its people, without focusing on party differences.</p>
            <p>Regarding President Lai Ching-te's statement tonight that Premier Cho Jung-tai will stay, but the government team will make four changes, Huang Kuo-chang criticized that President Lai's words and actions do not match. For example, Premier Cho Jung-tai just presented the central government's budget for 2026 this week, but it did not include salary increases for volunteer soldiers or adjustments to police and firefighter pensions. Huang Kuo-chang said this shows no respect for the law passed by the Legislative Yuan. He asked, "What kind of adjustment to executive-legislative interaction is this?"</p>
            <p>As for President Lai's comment at the press conference about improving cross-party discussions, Huang Kuo-chang said that Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus whip Ker Chien-ming used long, pointless speeches to stop communication between the executive and legislative branches. Also, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Kung Ming-hsin did not attend the Interior Committee meeting. Huang Kuo-chang asked how such actions could improve communication between the executive and legislative branches.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang also criticized that the DPP's political influence on the legal system is very clear. He said President Lai still had the nerve to tell the people that "no political influence has affected the legal system." Huang Kuo-chang added that the TPP will create an investigation committee in the parliament in the next session, making it the top priority.</p>

            <h1>Cabinet: Personnel Changes to Start Next Week to Make Policies More Effective</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te said today that he has asked Premier Cho Jung-tai to stay many times, hoping they can work together to protect the country's key tasks. The Executive Yuan said tonight that Premier Cho Jung-tai will follow President Lai's instructions. He will adjust the team, change the order of policies, improve how the executive and legislative branches work together, and make the country's finances stronger. Also, there will be changes in government staff next week to make policies feel more effective.</p>
            <p>President Lai spoke at the Presidential Office tonight about the results of the referendum on restarting the third nuclear power plant and the recall votes for seven lawmakers. He also answered questions from the media. He mentioned that Premier Cho Jung-tai offered to resign many times after the recall votes on July 26. But at this time, trade talks with the US are not finished, and recovery work after typhoons and heavy rains is still happening. Also, this year's additional budget and special budget, as well as next year's central government budget, are being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. Many important national policies also need to move forward steadily. So, President Lai hopes Premier Cho Jung-tai will continue in his role and take on this important responsibility to protect the country's key tasks.</p>
            <p>President Lai also said that to meet the public's expectations and protect the country's key tasks, the government team will make "four adjustments." These include adjusting the team, changing the order of policies, improving how the executive and legislative branches work together, and making the country's finances stronger. This will make the team more efficient and policies more effective.</p>
            <p>Executive Yuan spokesperson Li Hui-chih said through a media group tonight that Premier Cho Jung-tai offered to take political responsibility after July 26. He also felt that the cabinet needed big changes and faster, greater reforms to meet public expectations. However, important tasks for the Executive Yuan right now include recovery from typhoon and flood disasters, responding to trade talks with the US, ongoing support for industries, the 2025 additional budget, the Dannaas typhoon, the plan to build resilience, and next year's central government budget. All these need to be finished by their deadlines and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. Today's national election went smoothly. After this is done, President Lai should carefully plan the cabinet's staff changes to respond to public opinion and speed up reforms.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih said that President Lai wants Premier Cho Jung-tai to stay in his position and work together to protect the country's key tasks. To keep the government stable and move the country forward, Premier Cho Jung-tai has agreed to make the four adjustments as instructed by President Lai. Personnel changes will begin next week. In the future, the top priorities for policies will be the economy, people's lives, helping those in need, and supporting young people. The team will be more efficient, and policies will feel more effective.</p>
