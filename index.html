            <h1>China Tries to Take Congratulatory Message from Taiwan's Taekwondo Team at Universiade; Green and White Parties Speak Out</h1>
            <p>Two people from China tried to take a congratulatory message from Taiwanese athletes at the Universiade in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany today. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) both shared statements today to criticize China's rough actions.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's taekwondo team won a silver medal at the World University Games in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany today. But after they won, two Chinese people tried to take the congratulatory message from the Minister of Education from the athletes. They also argued with Taiwanese media.</p>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party said in a statement that when Taiwan's athletes compete abroad, China uses rough, violent, and uncivilized ways. They not only stopped the congratulatory message but also caused many other problems.</p>
            <p>The DPP said that it is very normal and right for a government to send a congratulatory message to its athletes when they win a medal. All people in Taiwan should work together, no matter who they are, to support Taiwan's athletes. All Taiwanese people see what China is doing, and they should criticize it. Such actions are not civilized and should not happen.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party also shared a strong statement today. They said this behavior is not only wild but also shows no sportsmanship. It will not help improve relations between Taiwan and China.</p>
            <p>The TPP said that Taiwan's taekwondo men's team won a silver medal at the Rhine-Ruhr Universiade, which is something Taiwan can be proud of. Athletes represent their country in international sports events and bring honor to the nation. However, China tried to stop them rudely by taking Taiwan's congratulatory message, which made simple sports exchange less good.</p>
            <p>The TPP said they support the Sports Administration officials for protecting the athletes' and the country's honor. They also asked China to stop similar actions right away and not use politics to stop Taiwanese athletes from doing well in international competitions.</p>

            <h1>Thailand to Send Away Cambodian Ambassador After Claiming New Landmines Injured Soldier</h1>
            <p>Thailand's acting Prime Minister, Phumtham, has accused Cambodia of putting new landmines in a disputed border area. These landmines hurt a Thai soldier. The ruling party, Pheu Thai, said that Thailand has called back its ambassador from Cambodia and will send away Cambodia's ambassador.</p>
            <p>Channel NewsAsia reported that the Pheu Thai Party said on social media that Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has officially complained to Cambodia. They said the landmines found in that area were new and were not there during earlier patrols. They also said Thailand has lowered its diplomatic relations with Cambodia.</p>
            <p>The government of Cambodia did not immediately reply to requests for comments.</p>
            <p>Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that it had not been told about the decision to call back the Thai special official or the plan to send away the Cambodian ambassador.</p>
            <p>According to what the Pheu Thai Party posted on Facebook, acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said that Thailand has lowered its diplomatic relations with Cambodia and will look at the relationship more closely.</p>
            <p>Pheu Thai also said that the government has ordered all border crossing points in the area to close. This will greatly limit the number of people entering the country.</p>
            <p>Pheu Thai said that yesterday's landmine incident hurt the Thai soldier, causing him to lose his right leg. The Thai government had already criticized Cambodia on July 20 for supposedly putting anti-personnel mines along the border between the two countries.</p>
            <p>The former leaders of the two countries also argued. Cambodia's former Prime Minister, Hun Sen, said he did not want to talk to Thailand's former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra.</p>
            <p>On July 20, Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the border conflict by saying that these landmines seriously break international law and go against Thailand's right to control its own land.</p>
            <p>The Thai newspaper "The Nation" reported that on July 16, an explosion near the Chong Bok border area in Ubon Ratchathani province hurt three Thai soldiers.</p>
            <p>The Nation also said that after Thai officials checked, they found that the landmines involved in this event were new and were not part of Thailand's weapons or supplies.</p>
            <p>Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the evening of July 21 that they did not put new landmines there. They stated that the Thai soldiers went off their agreed patrol route inside Cambodia and entered an area that still had unexploded landmines.</p>
            <p>Thai and Cambodian soldiers fought near the Mom Bei area on May 28, and one Cambodian soldier died. Since then, Thailand and Cambodia have been in a difficult military and diplomatic situation. They have sent more soldiers along the land border and have put rules on crossing the border in return.</p>

            <h1>Former Taoyuan City Councilor Wu Tsung-hsien Accused of Stealing Millions in Assistant Fees; Prosecutors Ask for Detention</h1>
            <p>Wu Tsung-hsien, a former Taoyuan City Councilor from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is accused of taking millions of New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) by falsely claiming assistant fees. The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office searched on July 22. Yesterday, they brought in Wu Tsung-hsien and his assistant, Fan Jiang. They asked the court to hold them without allowing visitors. The court decided that assistant Fan Jiang could be released on bail for NTD 300,000, but Wu Tsung-hsien's case is still being looked at by the court.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office said today that Wu Tsung-hsien and his assistant Fan Jiang, along with others, are suspected of claiming assistant fees that were not real. This happened from January 2011 to January 2019, when Wu Tsung-hsien was a Taoyuan City Councilor. The amount of money taken was nearly ten million NTD.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office said that starting July 22, they led the Taipei City Investigation Office of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau. For several days, they searched 11 places and called Wu Tsung-hsien and 9 other people to answer questions. After the questioning, the prosecutors believe that Wu Tsung-hsien and the other 9 people are suspected of crimes under the Anti-Corruption Act. These crimes include public officials using their jobs to take money.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office said that Wu Tsung-hsien and his assistant Fan Jiang are strongly suspected of a crime. There is a risk that they might try to escape or talk to other people involved in the case. So, yesterday and early this morning, the prosecutors asked the Taoyuan District Court to hold them without allowing visitors. For the other people accused, except for another person named Wu who the prosecutor asked to be released, all others were released on bail. The bail amounts were from NTD 30,000 to NTD 100,000.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office said that after the court looked at assistant Fan Jiang's case, it found that he was strongly suspected of a crime and that there was a reason to hold him. However, because important evidence that was not spoken was complete, the court decided that it was not necessary to hold him and allowed him to be released on bail for NTD 300,000. Wu Tsung-hsien's case is still being looked at by the court right now.</p>
