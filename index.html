Despite ongoing problems with getting the necessary parts, electric car maker Tesla announced a record profit for the last three months. The company managed to earn more money than ever before, showing its strength in a challenging global economy. CEO Elon Musk said the results were due to increased production at their factories and a focus on efficiency. However, he warned that supply chain difficulties are likely to continue for the rest of the year. This could mean slower growth in the future, but Tesla remains confident in its long-term prospects. The company's stock price rose slightly after the announcement, reflecting investor confidence in Tesla's ability to navigate the current economic situation. They are also investing heavily in new factories and technologies to secure their position in the electric vehicle market.

**Article 2: Innovation - New AI Tool Helps Doctors Diagnose Diseases Faster**

A new artificial intelligence (AI) tool is helping doctors make quicker and more accurate diagnoses. Developed by researchers at a leading university, the AI can analyse medical images like X-rays and scans to identify signs of disease. This technology could significantly speed up the diagnostic process, allowing patients to receive treatment sooner. In trials, the AI tool has shown promising results, accurately detecting diseases like pneumonia and certain types of cancer. Doctors using the AI reported feeling more confident in their diagnoses, especially in complex cases. The developers believe this tool could be particularly useful in areas with limited access to specialist medical expertise. While the AI is not intended to replace doctors, it aims to provide them with a valuable aid in making critical decisions.

**Article 3: Travel - Italy Introduces New Rules to Combat Overtourism in Venice**

Venice, Italy is introducing new rules to manage the increasing number of tourists visiting the city. The new regulations aim to protect the city's fragile environment and improve the quality of life for local residents. One key measure is a new entry fee for day-trippers, designed to discourage short visits that contribute to overcrowding but not to the local economy. The city is also cracking down on unauthorised tourist activities, such as illegal street vendors and poorly managed tour groups. These measures are part of a broader effort to promote sustainable tourism, encouraging visitors to stay longer, explore less crowded areas, and respect the city's cultural heritage. Local authorities hope that these changes will help preserve Venice for future generations while still welcoming tourists.
