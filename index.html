A growing trend called "quiet quitting" is gaining attention online, particularly on platforms like TikTok. It describes employees who are no longer going above and beyond in their jobs. Instead, they are simply fulfilling their basic job duties and sticking strictly to their working hours. They're not necessarily looking for new jobs, but they're also not actively engaged or invested in their current roles beyond the minimum requirements.

Experts say that this trend often stems from a feeling of being undervalued, overworked, or lacking opportunities for growth within a company. Employees experiencing these issues may feel disillusioned and less motivated to contribute more than what is strictly expected. This can lead to a decrease in overall productivity and innovation within organizations.

For employers, the rise of quiet quitting serves as a wake-up call. It highlights the importance of creating a positive and supportive work environment where employees feel appreciated, challenged, and have opportunities for advancement. Companies need to focus on open communication, recognizing employee contributions, and addressing concerns about workload and work-life balance to re-engage their workforce and prevent quiet quitting from becoming a widespread issue.

**Air Travel Chaos Continues as Airlines Struggle with Staffing Shortages**

Airlines around the world are still facing significant disruptions, leading to flight delays, cancellations, and lost luggage. A major contributing factor is a shortage of staff, including pilots, flight attendants, and ground crew. This shortage has been worsened by the rapid rebound in travel demand after the COVID-19 pandemic, which caught many airlines unprepared.

Many employees left the industry during the pandemic due to job losses and uncertainty. Now, airlines are struggling to recruit and train enough new staff to meet the increased demand. This problem is compounded by stricter safety regulations and health protocols, which can slow down operations and increase costs.

Passengers are bearing the brunt of these challenges, with many experiencing long wait times at airports, missed connections, and difficulties in getting their luggage back. Airlines are working to address the staffing shortages by offering incentives to attract new employees and streamline their operations. However, experts predict that these disruptions could continue for some time, urging travelers to be prepared for potential delays and cancellations.

**Innovative Startup Develops Sustainable Packaging from Seaweed**

A new startup is making waves in the packaging industry with its innovative solution for sustainable alternatives to plastic. The company has developed a process for creating biodegradable packaging from seaweed, offering a renewable and environmentally friendly option for various products.

Seaweed is a readily available resource that grows quickly and doesn't require land, freshwater, or fertilizers. The seaweed-based packaging is completely biodegradable and compostable, breaking down naturally in the environment without leaving harmful microplastics behind. This contrasts sharply with traditional plastic packaging, which can take hundreds of years to decompose and contributes to pollution.

The startup is currently partnering with food and beverage companies to pilot its seaweed packaging for items like snacks, drinks, and takeout containers. The company hopes that its innovative approach will help reduce plastic waste and promote a more circular economy. They believe that their sustainable packaging solution has the potential to transform the industry and contribute to a healthier planet.
