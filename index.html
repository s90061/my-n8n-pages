            <h1>Trump and Putin to Meet; Global Oil Prices Fall More Than 1%</h1>
            <p>(New York, October 16, CNA) International oil prices went down by more than 1% today. This happened because US President Trump said he and Russian President Putin agreed to meet soon in Hungary. They will talk about how to stop the war in Ukraine. This news makes the future of global energy supply less clear.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures dropped by 85 cents, or 1.37%. The price closed at 61.06 US dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures also fell by 81 cents, or 1.39%. They closed at 57.46 US dollars per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Sources Say US Justice Department Wants to Charge Former National Security Advisor Bolton</h1>
            <p>(Greenbelt, Maryland, October 16, CNA) People with information say that the US Justice Department plans to ask a grand jury today to charge John Bolton. He used to be President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that court papers made public last month show Bolton is under federal investigation. This is for possibly handling secret information in the wrong way. The exact charges prosecutors will make are not clear yet.</p>
            <p>If the grand jury decides to charge Bolton, it will be the third time recently that the US Justice Department has charged someone who criticizes Trump.</p>
            <p>Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, did not answer media questions right away. Lowell has said before that Bolton did nothing wrong.</p>
            <p>Bolton used to be the US Ambassador to the United Nations. He also worked as the White House National Security Advisor during Trump's first term. But later, Bolton became one of Trump's strongest critics. In his book last year, he said Trump was not fit to be president.</p>

            <h1>Trump Warns Hamas: Stop Killing or US Will Attack</h1>
            <p>(Washington, October 16, CNA) US President Trump said today that if Hamas keeps killing innocent people in Gaza, the US will "move in and destroy" Hamas. He said this because Hamas shot Palestinian civilians recently, after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump's statement comes after he recently said he was "not too bothered" by these shootings, including public killings, done by the Palestinian group Hamas. He called them "gangster killings."</p>
            <p>Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," "If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which is not part of the agreement, we will have no choice but to move in and destroy them."</p>
            <p>However, Trump did not say exactly who "we" meant. Yesterday, he said that the US does not need to send soldiers to be involved in Gaza matters.</p>
            <p>Since the US-supported 20-point ceasefire agreement started, Israeli troops have partly left Gaza. Hamas has made its control stronger over the cities ruined by war. They are stopping people more harshly and killing those on the streets who are said to be helping the enemy.</p>
            <p>Admiral Brad Cooper, the highest US military leader in the Middle East, asked Hamas yesterday to stop shooting Palestinian civilians and follow Trump's plan.</p>
