            <h1>Zelensky Calls for Talks with Putin as Peace Efforts Stall</h1>
            <p>Today is Ukraine's Independence Day. President Zelensky said that talking with Russian President Putin would be the "best way to move the peace process forward." This is because efforts to end the war through diplomacy are not working well.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Ukraine launched a drone attack today. This caused a fire at a nuclear power plant in Russia.</p>
            <p>US President Trump is trying to arrange a meeting between Ukraine and Russia. But Russia said on August 22nd that a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would not happen soon. This made hopes for peace smaller.</p>
            <p>However, Zelensky said today that "talks between leaders are the most effective way to move the (peace) process forward." He again asked for a meeting with Putin.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Western countries were trying to "find excuses to stop talks." He also criticized Zelensky for "demanding an immediate meeting at any cost."</p>
            <p>Zelensky made a promise at a ceremony. US Special Envoy Keith Kellogg and other Western officials were there. Zelensky promised to "force Russia to make peace."</p>

            <h1>Sung Hsin-hao Wins AUBL MVP; Coach Chen Tzu-wei Happy They Found Their Own Style</h1>
            <p>The National Chengchi University (NCCU) Griffins, champions of the UBA college basketball league, won the championship at the Asian University Basketball League (AUBL) today. Sung Hsin-hao, a key player, was chosen for the best five players and also won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. Coach Chen Tzu-wei was proud that his players showed their own way of playing.</p>
            <p>The NCCU Griffins represented Taiwan at the AUBL games in Hangzhou, China. In today's final game, they played against Tsinghua University from Beijing. Sung Hsin-hao, a star player, scored 29 points, which was the most in the game. He also got 12 rebounds and 6 assists. Another guard, Hsu Te-chi, added 20 points. The Griffins won the game 82 to 79 and took home the championship trophy.</p>
            <p>Coach Chen Tzu-wei, whose voice was hoarse from cheering, told CNA that he thanked team leader Chiang Feng-nien for finding a professional team to help. He also thanked the hard-working coaching staff. He said he always wanted UBA to be recognized internationally. "This time, we did it. Now UBA is getting better. Many schools care more about basketball and keep working hard."</p>
            <p>In this Asian University Basketball League, NCCU guard Sung Hsin-hao played very well. He averaged 21.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. His all-around performance was key to the team winning. Sung Hsin-hao was not only chosen for the best five players but also received the MVP award.</p>
            <p>Chen Tzu-wei said that this new Griffins team, led by Sung Hsin-hao and team captain Hsu Te-chi, has found its own style after Yu Ai-che left. He was very happy that they did not live in the shadow of older players. He especially noted that Sung Hsin-hao and Hsu Te-chi are strong and not afraid of challenges. Together, they made the Griffins stronger than before.</p>
            <p>"After the game, I told them to move past the Yu Ai-che era and write their own stories. This is something that makes me very proud as a coach," Chen Tzu-wei said. He hopes to keep UBA competitive in the future. This will help train new players for Taiwan's basketball world. It will also help them learn how to play with foreign players earlier.</p>
