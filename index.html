            <h1>Bulareyaung Dance Company Celebrates 10 Years, Brings Hunting Discussion to Germany</h1>
            <p>Weimar, September 21 (CNA) â€“ "Is hunting a tradition we should keep, or is it a cruel thing that doesn't fit today's world?" This is a question asked by the Bulareyaung Dance Company (BDC) from Taitung, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. In September, the company performed its dance "Luna" at the Weimar Arts Festival in Germany. They brought old Bunun songs to a European stage. They also started a discussion about whether indigenous hunting is still right in modern times, sharing this idea with people from around the world.</p>
            <p>"Luna" is a famous dance by BDC, first performed in 2018. It uses traditional Bunun songs and mixes them with the dancers' body movements and creative ideas. In September, the dance company was invited to perform "Luna" twice at the Weimar Arts Festival in Germany. The show was almost 70 minutes long and only used the dancers' singing and movements. At the end, the audience in Germany clapped very loudly.</p>
            <p>The founder of the dance company, Bulareyaung Pagarlava, is a Paiwan indigenous choreographer. He was interviewed in Weimar and said that when he created this dance, people in Taiwan were talking a lot about whether indigenous hunting should be legal. So, he thought: "If there is no hunting ground, can someone still be called a hunter? In the same way, if there is no stage, can we still be called dancers?"</p>
            <p>He pointed out that "Luna" does not give an answer. Instead, it lets the dancers and the audience think about the question. While making the dance, the dancers argued about hunting. Some thought it was part of indigenous culture, while others said it was cruel. Some even said, "If you want to eat meat, just buy it at the supermarket." Bulareyaung put these arguments from practice onto the stage. This way, the audience could see different opinions clashing.</p>
            <p>Bulareyaung explained that BDC's main special feature is "co-creation." This means dancers' sudden ideas and life experiences often become part of the dance. For example, the Bunun tradition of "reporting hunting success" was originally a hunter loudly telling others what they caught. In "Luna," this became the dancers sharing stories about their own lives.</p>
            <p>"We let the dancers shout out their own stories. Some shouted that they wanted to fly like an eagle. Others said they wanted to take care of their family." This new way of doing "reporting hunting success" helped dancers who had never hunted feel closer to themselves. It also showed the audience how old traditions can continue in new ways today. This change also touched the elders in the tribe.</p>
            <p>This year is BDC's 10th anniversary. Bulareyaung, who used to dance with Cloud Gate Dance Theatre and Martha Graham Dance Company, is now following his own path. He said that in his younger years, because he was indigenous, he felt sensitive and always thought, "I must not let anyone look down on me."</p>
            <p>When he returned to his hometown, Taitung, to start the dance company, he met many young dancers from different places. He slowly learned to accept all kinds of imperfections. This helped him understand where he came from and become a more real Bulareyaung. He shared with CNA that being able to create and grow with his team members is the biggest success he wants to report for the dance company's 10th anniversary.</p>
            <p>Looking to the next ten years, the dance company has already performed for free in 55 indigenous towns in Taiwan. Bulareyaung said their next goal is to visit all indigenous villages across Taiwan. Many people in distant areas might never get to go to a theater in their whole lives. So, bringing their art back to these home communities is a very important goal for the dance company.</p>
            <p>He also hopes that more people around the world will get to know where the dance company comes from, through their dancing and singing. Bulareyaung always remembers that when he went to the Luona village to learn old Bunun songs, a 91-year-old elder told him that she hoped the dance company could share Bunun songs with the whole world.</p>
            <p>After the Weimar Arts Festival, a local newspaper, "ThÃ¼ringer Allgemeine," wrote that the ideas from the Taiwanese dance company were worth thinking about. It asked, "If hunting is no longer suitable for modern times, how can we stop indigenous cultural traditions from becoming empty shells without life?" The newspaper also praised "Luna" for successfully making the dance a mirror that shows its own traditions.</p>

            <h1>Joseph Wu Tells US Media: UN Should Recognize Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 21 (CNA) â€“ "Newsmax" is a media company that supports US President Trump and has become popular quickly. As the United Nations General Assembly is happening, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu wrote an article for Newsmax's website. He said clearly that "now is the time for the United Nations to recognize Taiwan." He also used the phrase "chip in" in a clever way, asking all countries to see Taiwan's important contributions in areas like semiconductors.</p>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly started on September 9th at the UN headquarters in New York. In his article published today on the "Newsmax" website, Joseph Wu said that Taiwan makes big contributions around the world. However, most international groups do not recognize Taiwan, and Taiwan cannot join the UN system. He said this is sad.</p>
            <p>He stated that Taiwan is unfairly kept out because China intentionally twists the meaning of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758.</p>
            <p>In 1971, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2758. This resolution said that the People's Republic of China was the only legal representative of "China" at the UN, and it removed "Chiang Kai-shek's representatives." After this, Beijing connected Resolution 2758 with the "One China Principle." It wrongly said that this means "Taiwan is part of China" and does not need its own representatives. This stops Taiwan from joining UN groups and activities.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said that this resolution is wrongly linked to the "One China Principle." He added that it is still used as a tool to stop Taiwan from taking part.</p>
            <p>"However, UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan at all. It only talks about who represents China at the UN. This resolution does not say that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China. It also does not give the People's Republic of China the right to represent Taiwan in the UN system."</p>
            <p>He said that the UN, however, gave in to political pressure from China. It used this resolution as an excuse to keep Taiwan out of international groups. Taiwan has spoken out against this unfair act and is getting more and more support.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said that international support for Taiwan is growing stronger. At meetings like the G7 summit and other talks between two or more countries, the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is mentioned more and more.</p>
            <p>Also, the governments and lawmaking bodies of many countries have publicly said that UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 does not decide Taiwan's status. It also does not stop Taiwan from joining UN groups or other international organizations.</p>
            <p>"As the UN celebrates its 80th anniversary, there are only five years left to reach the Sustainable Development Goals. It is time to include Taiwan. This will make the goals of 'leaving no one behind' and 'working together' a reality."</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said that Taiwan asks all countries to "chip in." This means to help recognize Taiwan's rightful place on the world stage and to accept the contributions Taiwan can make.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office in the US said that "Newsmax" started in 1998. It is one of the most powerful conservative media outlets in America. Its website and news channels are very important to politicians and conservative viewers in the US.</p>
            <p>In July, Trump's media company, "Trump Media & Technology Group," launched a TV streaming platform called Truth+ for people around the world. This streaming service will also work with "Newsmax." They hope to make their businesses bigger.</p>

            <h1>Kim Jong Un Praises Trump, Open to Talks But Won't Give Up Nuclear Weapons</h1>
            <p>Seoul, September 21 (CNA) â€“ North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said today through the state news agency, KCNA, that Pyongyang is willing to start talks with the US again. This will happen if the US stops asking North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. He also admitted that he still has "good memories" of US President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>KCNA quoted Kim Jong Un, who said: "If the US can let go of its unrealistic idea of us giving up nuclear weapons, accept the truth, and truly want to live peacefully together, then we have no reason not to sit down and talk with the US."</p>
            <p>Kim Jong Un pointed out that North Korea developed nuclear weapons to protect itself and to survive, because of serious threats from the US and South Korea.</p>
            <p>He said that recent offers for talks from Washington and Seoul were refused. This is because the real aim was still to make North Korea weaker and to change its government, so these offers were not honest.</p>
            <p>Kim Jong Un said that South Korea's plan to end North Korea's nuclear program step by step shows this kind of attitude.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Kim Jong Un admitted that he still has "good memories" of US President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the two leaders met three times during Trump's first time as president. However, later talks did not work out.</p>
            <p>KCNA reported that Kim Jong Un said: "I still have good memories of the current US President Trump." He also shared that he is open to having talks with Washington.</p>
