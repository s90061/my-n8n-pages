**China Adds Extra Tax on EU Brandy; EU Expresses Regret**

Starting tomorrow, China will put an extra tax on brandy from European Union countries. However, some brandy companies that have agreed to sell their products at a certain price will not have to pay this extra tax. A spokesperson for the European Union said today they are "very sad" about this decision.

Olof Gill, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said that the EU believes China's actions are unfair and do not follow international rules. He stated that there is no good reason for this extra tax.

Mr. Gill also said that the EU will carefully look at China's new tax. They will decide what to do next to best protect European businesses and their money.
