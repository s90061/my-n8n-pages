            <h1>Credit Card Spending for 5 Big Banks in August Revealed: CTBC Bank is Number One with NT$66.9 Billion</h1>
            <p>Thanks to the popular summer travel season and many chances for dining and shopping, the total credit card spending for the top 5 banks that issue credit cards reached NT$266.231 billion in August. This is a 4.19% increase compared to last year. Among them, CTBC Bank had NT$66.95 billion in August. Also, they launched a new co-branded card with Uni-President Group, which helped them issue many new cards, reaching 225,000 in August. This made them number one in both total spending and new cards issued.</p>
            <p>CTBC Bank's spending in August was NT$66.95 billion, which is a 10% increase from last year. CTBC Bank said that in August, people spent more on travel abroad, school fees, dining out, and transportation during the summer holidays. These types of spending made up more than 50% of the total spending in August. From January to August this year, the total spending was NT$580 billion, an 8% increase from last year.</p>
            <p>Cathay United Bank's spending in August was NT$65.056 billion, an 8% increase. This growth was mainly because people traveled, ate out, and shopped more during the summer holidays. From January to August, their total spending was about NT$553.9 billion, showing a double-digit percentage increase.</p>
            <p>E.SUN Bank's spending in August was NT$47.848 billion, a 4.7% increase. This was the highest amount for that month in history. The growth came from payments made through apps, spending abroad, travel, and online shopping, all of which grew by double-digit percentages.</p>
            <p>Taipei Fubon Bank's spending in August was NT$47.356 billion, which was a small decrease of 0.9% compared to last year. Taipei Fubon Bank said that the increase in card use in August was mainly for overseas spending and shopping at big stores. These two areas made up almost 40% of their total spending. As autumn begins, Taipei Fubon Bank will continue to focus on travel spending and will work with department store anniversary sales and Double 11 online shopping events to boost spending in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>Taishin Bank's spending in August was NT$39.022 billion, a 5% decrease from last year. But if you add the money spent on income tax payments from June to August this year, the spending actually increased by 3% compared to last year. Looking ahead, Taishin Bank said that with department store anniversary sales starting soon and long holidays coming in October, they expect more spending on dining at department stores and overseas travel.</p>
            <p>As for the number of cards issued, CTBC Bank issued many more cards in August, reaching 225,000. E.SUN Bank was second with 133,000 cards. Cathay United Bank was third with 43,000 cards, Taishin Bank was fourth with 38,700 cards, and Taipei Fubon Bank was fifth with 38,600 cards.</p>
            <p>In August, CTBC Bank announced a big partnership with Uni-President Group to launch the CTBC uniopen co-branded card. This card combines over 30 brands from the Uni-President Group, which helped increase the number of new cards. CTBC Bank stated that they issued 225,000 cards in August, mostly due to the CTBC uniopen co-branded card. They plan to reach a goal of 1 million cards in the first year.</p>

            <h1>Lou Jun-shuo is Going to Be a Dad and Vomited When He Got Home; His Wife Jiao Fan-fan Joked He Was Too Nervous</h1>
            <p>Singer Lou Jun-shuo announced at his concert in Taichung last night that he will become a father. After the concert, he said in an interview that his wife, Jiao Fan-fan, had been mistakenly pregnant twice before. So, he wanted to stay calm this time. Jiao Fan-fan laughed and said that Lou Jun-shuo was so nervous when he found out for sure that he was going to be a dad that he vomited when he got home.</p>
            <p>Lou Jun-shuo said that they don't know the baby's gender yet, but the gender is not important. They just want the baby to be healthy. The couple originally planned to try hard to have a baby at the end of the year, but the good news came faster than they thought. Now, they are trying their best to make sure Jiao Fan-fan doesn't feel stressed. He added, "Seeing her vomit also makes me feel bad for her."</p>
            <p>Lou Jun-shuo mentioned that because Jiao Fan-fan had been mistakenly pregnant twice, he kept telling himself to stay calm when they first found out the good news this time. He said, "When we got to the hospital, the doctor said the dad could come in to see the ultrasound, and that's when it was truly real." Lou Jun-shuo remembered that the first time he heard the baby's heartbeat, he joked and asked the doctor, "Is the baby too nervous?"</p>
            <p>Jiao Fan-fan said that after they confirmed the pregnancy, they went to eat sukiyaki to celebrate. But when Lou Jun-shuo got home, he started to vomit. Lou Jun-shuo said he thought he had stomach flu, but Jiao Fan-fan teased him, saying he was vomiting because he was nervous about becoming a father.</p>

            <h1>Thai Baht Goes Up by More Than 7%, Causing Worry; Anutin Says It Must Be Fixed Now</h1>
            <p>The Thai Baht has gotten stronger against the US dollar by more than 7% this year, and this worries people in trade. Thai Prime Minister Anutin said today that the strong Thai Baht needs to be fixed right away, and they will talk about it. Also, some news reports say that Thailand plans to tax gold buying and selling to stop the Baht from getting even stronger.</p>
            <p>The Thai Baht has gone up by more than 7% since the start of this year. It is now the second best-performing currency in Asia, after the New Taiwan Dollar. Companies like those that trade rice are worried about the strong Baht and are asking the government to do something about the exchange rate.</p>
            <p>Charoen Laothammatas, the head of the Thai Rice Exporters Association, recently asked the government and the Bank of Thailand to take steps to make the Thai Baht exchange rate stable. This is to protect how competitive Thai rice is in the world and to help farmers earn money.</p>
            <p>The "Bangkok Post" reported today that Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the strong Thai Baht must be fixed immediately. He will talk about this later today.</p>
            <p>The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) said that an exchange rate of 34 to 35 Thai Baht for 1 US dollar would be better for Thailand's economy.</p>
            <p>The "Bangkok Post" also said that the country's planning agency expects Thailand's economy to grow by 1.8% to 2.3% this year. However, because of US taxes, economic growth in the second half of this year is expected to slow down a lot. Thailand's economy grew by 2.5% last year, which was less than other countries.</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Post quoted financial news reports saying that Thai officials are thinking about putting a tax on gold trading. This is to stop the Thai Baht from getting stronger, as a strong Baht is hurting exports and tourism.</p>
            <p>The report quoted sources who said that the Bank of Thailand and the Ministry of Finance are discussing taxing online gold buying and selling that uses Thai Baht. The sources added that the government hopes this tax will reduce gold exports and make it more expensive for Thai people to hold gold. They also pointed out that US dollars coming into the country from gold shipments are one reason the Thai Baht is getting stronger.</p>
