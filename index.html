            <p>In the "Women's Tug-of-War" event, the President said that the athletes were not afraid of the rain. From the first round to the final, they won 7 games in a row and took home the gold medal. They also achieved an amazing 6 wins in a row in the world women's tug-of-war event, which is a first in history. In the "Beach Korfball" event, they also won all their games, taking the gold medal with 6 wins in a row.</p>
            <p>For the "Women's Fin Swimming" event, the President said that Huang Mei-chien won a silver medal in her first competition, and He Pin-li also broke the national record. He could not mention all the other athletes one by one, but he said, "You are all the best, you are all Taiwan's heroes."</p>
            <p>The President also asked aloud, "When will the Ministry of Sports be formed?" Huang Mei-chien quickly answered, "September 9th," and there was a lot of applause. President Lai said that on September 9th, which is National Sports Day, the Ministry of Sports will officially open. Besides the existing National Sports Training Center and Sports Science Center, a "National Sports for All Agency" and a "National Sports Industry Development Center" will also be set up.</p>
            <p>The President stressed that sports show a country's strength. He hopes that by creating the Ministry of Sports, its status will be raised. With a new structure and new policies, more resources will be given, and different types of experts will be included to create a better environment. Taiwan is now a global Taiwan. The great performance of Taiwan's heroes makes Taiwan shine even brighter, and he hopes that through sports, Taiwan will become stronger.</p>
            <p>The President mentioned that the Executive Yuan today approved the central government's general budget for 2026. The sports budget alone is more than NT$20 billion. He hopes that athletes will achieve even greater results in the future.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Steelers Leave PLG; League Immediately Welcomes Yankee Engineering as 4th Team</h1>
            <p>PLG announced today that the Kaohsiung Steelers have officially left the league. But at the same time, the league said that "Yankee Engineering," through Yankee Sports and Entertainment, has asked to join and become the league's 4th team. The new season is expected to start as planned.</p>
            <p>After the P. LEAGUE+ (PLG) and Taiwan Professional Basketball League (TPBL) could not agree to work together during the off-season, both leagues decided to continue developing on their own.</p>
            <p>Since early July, many players and coach Chiu Ta-tsung from the PLG Kaohsiung Steelers had their contracts end. The whole team then stopped working, which made people worry about how the PLG would operate in the new season with only 3 teams left.</p>
            <p>Today, PLG said in a statement, "The league received a letter from the Kaohsiung Steelers asking to leave the PLG. After a meeting, this request was approved today. PLG thanks the Steelers for their efforts over the past 4 seasons and for their big contribution to the league and local fans."</p>
            <p>PLG emphasized that in the future, PLG and its teams will aim to create Taiwan's best professional basketball stage. They will continue to work for the good of Taiwan's basketball.</p>
            <p>Soon after, PLG confirmed that "Yankee Engineering," a company from Hsinchu, will join PLG through Yankee Sports and Entertainment. This has already been approved by the executive board, making them the 4th team. In the future, they will form the team based on honest and healthy principles.</p>
            <p>After "sending off the old and welcoming the new" today, PLG now has 4 teams: Taipei Fubon Braves, Taoyuan Pauian Pilots, Tainan TSG GhostHawks, and Yankee Sports and Entertainment.</p>
