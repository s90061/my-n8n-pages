**Two People Arrested for Threatening Prosecutor in Jinghua City Case**

In Taipei, two people have been arrested because they might have threatened a prosecutor. This prosecutor is working on an important case called the "Jinghua City case."

The police said the two people, Dai Ruei-ning and Lin Hui-chu, put pictures and words on social media that were scary. They showed the prosecutor's name and photo, even with fake blood. They wrote things like "a life for a life" and "remember their names."

A court in Taipei decided that these two people must stay in jail and cannot see anyone. This is because the court thinks they might try to hide information or talk to other people involved in the case.

**China Adds Tax on European Drinks, European Stock Market Goes Down**

China has announced that it will put a new tax on a type of alcohol called brandy, which comes from countries in the European Union. This tax can be as high as 34.9%. This decision is called an "anti-dumping tax."

Because of this news, the stock markets in Europe closed lower today. Stocks are like small parts of companies that people buy and sell. When the market "goes down," it means these parts are worth less money.

For example, the main stock market in London went down a little. The markets in Frankfurt (Germany) and Paris (France) also went down by more than half a percent.
