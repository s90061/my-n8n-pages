            <h1>Singapore Calls on Military Units to Respond to Hacker Attacks</h1>
            <p>Singapore's Minister of Defense announced that military units have been asked to help fight a cyber attack. This attack is aimed at important computer systems in the country. Experts believe that a group of spies linked to China is trying to carry out this attack.</p>
            <p>Singaporean news reports that Minister of Defense Ng Eng Hen said selected units will work with the Cyber Security Agency (CSA). This is part of the government's full plan to deal with this threat.</p>
            <p>The report said that Ng Eng Hen described this cyber attack as 'one example of new dangers' that the military must handle.</p>
            <p>So far, there are no reports that Singapore's systems have been broken into.</p>
            <p>K. Shanmugam, who is Singapore's Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law, first talked about this cyber attack on July 18. He called it a 'Advanced Persistent Threat' (APT). This type of attack is very dangerous for Singapore.</p>
            <p>An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a type of cyber attack. In this attack, a hacker gets into a computer system without permission and stays there for a long time without being found.</p>
            <p>Shanmugam said, 'I can say the situation is serious, and it is still happening.' He directly named the hacker group as UNC3886.</p>
            <p>Shanmugam did not give more details in his speech about who supports this group or where the attack came from.</p>
            <p>However, Mandiant, a security company owned by Google, said that UNC3886 is 'a spy group linked to China.'</p>
            <p>Shanmugam said that APT attackers often steal important information and damage important services. These services include healthcare, phones, water, transport, and electricity.</p>
            <p>He added, 'If the attack works, they can do spying and cause big problems for Singapore and its people.'</p>
            <p>Yesterday, China's embassy in Singapore showed 'strong unhappiness' about news reports linking the UNC3886 hacker group to China. The embassy said in a statement that China 'strongly opposes any false accusations against China.' It also said that 'in fact, China is one of the main victims of cyber attacks.'</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy: New Peace Talks Proposed to Russia for Next Week</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that Kyiv has asked Moscow for new peace talks next week. He hopes to make the talks about stopping the fighting go faster.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ukraine and Russia have had two rounds of talks in Istanbul, Turkey, in the past five months. Both sides agreed to exchange prisoners of war. But they have not made big progress in ending the war, which has lasted more than three years.</p>
            <p>In his evening speech to the country, Zelenskyy said, 'We should do everything to stop the fighting. Russia should not avoid making decisions anymore.'</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said that Rustem Umerov, who led Ukraine's team in the first two Istanbul talks, has invited Russia to meet next week. Zelenskyy did not give more details.</p>
            <p>Last week, Rustem Umerov, who was Ukraine's former Minister of Defense, was made the head of the National Security and Defence Council. He was given the job of moving the talks forward.</p>
