            <h1>Japanese Priority Slogan Resonates with Voters; Sanseito Party Becomes Big Winner in Election</h1>
            <p>The far-right Sanseito Party in Japan was clearly one of the biggest winners in today's Upper House election. They gained strong support by warning about a "silent invasion" of immigrants and by promising lower taxes and more money for welfare programs.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Sanseito Party became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic on YouTube. They shared ideas about vaccines and global elite groups. With their message of "Japanese Priority," they entered mainstream politics.</p>
            <p>Three years ago, Sanseito only had 1 seat out of 248 in the Upper House. Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) predicts that the party will win many more seats this election, likely between 10 and 22.</p>
            <p>After the election, the 47-year-old leader of Sanseito, Sohei Kamiya, told Nippon Television (NTV): "'Japanese Priority' means helping Japanese people live better by stopping globalization. I am not saying we should completely stop foreigners from coming, and I am not saying all foreigners should leave Japan."</p>
            <p>Political experts say that Kamiya's message is exactly what voters want to hear. The economy is not doing well, and recently, the Japanese currency has been weak. This has attracted many tourists, but it has also made prices, which were already high, even more expensive for Japanese people.</p>
            <p>Japan's population is getting older quickly. Last year, about 3.8 million foreigners lived in Japan. This is the highest number ever, even though it is only 3% of Japan's total population. This percentage is very small compared to the United States or Europe.</p>
            <p>Kamiya, who used to be a supermarket manager and an English teacher, told Reuters before the election that he was inspired by US President Donald Trump's "brave political style."</p>
            <p>He is also compared to parties like Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the UK's Reform UK. However, in Japan, right-wing populist ideas have not become as strong as they have in Europe and the United States.</p>
            <p>Kamiya said that after the election, he plans to form alliances with other small parties, just like new populist parties in Europe. He will not work with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan for most of the time since World War II.</p>
            <p>Japanese politics has already moved more to the right because Sanseito focuses on immigration. Not long before the election, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government announced a new group to stop "crimes and bad behavior" by foreigners. His party also promised to have "zero illegal foreigners."</p>
            <p>Sanseito is similar to other opposition parties because they also want lower taxes and more money for child welfare. These plans make investors worried about Japan's money situation and its very large debt. However, Sanseito is different from other opposition parties because they are much stronger online. They use the internet to attack the current political system in Japan.</p>
            <p>Kamiya said that Sanseito's success in the Upper House is just the beginning.</p>
            <p>He said, "We are slowly increasing our number of members so that we don't disappoint the public. By building a strong organization and getting 50 or 60 seats, I truly believe our ideas will come true."</p>

            <h1>Israeli Soldiers Fire at People Seeking Aid; 73 Palestinians Dead, Many Injured</h1>
            <p>The Civil Defense agency in Gaza said that Israeli soldiers fired at Palestinian people trying to get humanitarian aid today in the war-torn Gaza Strip. This attack caused 73 deaths and left dozens of people injured.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that at least 67 people died when trucks carrying aid arrived in northern Gaza Strip. Additionally, six more people were reported to have died in the past 24 hours near an aid point in Rafah, in southern Gaza, after being shot.</p>
            <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) stated that their group of 25 trucks carrying food aid crossed from Israel through a checkpoint. Soon after, near Gaza City, they "met a large crowd of hungry civilians who were shot at."</p>
            <p>The Israeli army questioned the number of deaths. They said that thousands of people had gathered in Gaza City. Soldiers then fired warning shots "to remove the direct danger they faced."</p>
            <p>Civilians dying while trying to get aid has become a common event in Gaza. Authorities in Gaza blame the Israeli army for shooting at the large crowds going to aid centers, especially when there is a serious lack of food and basic supplies.</p>
            <p>The United Nations said earlier this month that nearly 800 people seeking aid have died since the end of May. This includes those who died along the routes where aid trucks were traveling.</p>

            <h1>Australian Think Tank: Western Aid Cuts to Southeast Asia Will Increase China's Influence</h1>
            <p>A study released today by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, says that China's power in Southeast Asia will grow. This is happening because the US government under President Trump and other Western countries are greatly reducing their help (aid) for development.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Lowy Institute in Sydney stated that Southeast Asia is in "an uncertain time." This is because Western countries are giving less official money for development, and the US has placed "very harsh" taxes on trade. This makes the region's situation difficult.</p>
            <p>The Lowy Institute also said: "Less Western aid risks giving China a bigger role. However, other Asian countries that give aid will also become more important."</p>
            <p>According to the Lowy Institute's yearly report, the total amount of official money for development that Southeast Asia received in 2023 increased "slightly" to 29 billion US dollars. But since then, Trump has stopped about 60 billion US dollars in development aid, most of which was from US programs for other countries.</p>
            <p>The report states that seven European countries, including France and Germany, and the European Union, have announced they will cut 17.2 billion US dollars in aid. This aid was supposed to be given between 2025 and 2029. The UK also said it would reduce its yearly aid by 7.6 billion US dollars to use that money for defense instead.</p>
            <p>This study predicts that based on recent announcements, the total official money for development going to Southeast Asia will decrease by over 2 billion US dollars by 2026. The study says, "These cuts will greatly hurt Southeast Asia."</p>
            <p>The study also said: "The focus of development money in Southeast Asia seems to be moving to the East, especially to Beijing, but also to Tokyo and Seoul."</p>
            <p>"As Western development aid decreases, China's importance as a partner in the region's development will increase."</p>
            <p>The report pointed out that in 2023, Beijing increased its money for development in Southeast Asia by 1.6 billion US dollars, reaching 4.9 billion US dollars. Most of this money went to large building projects, such as railway connections in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
            <p>At the same time, China's promises for building projects in Southeast Asia grew four times, to almost 10 billion US dollars. This was largely because the deep-sea port project in Kyaukphyu, Myanmar, started again.</p>
