            <h1>US H-1B Visa Fee Jumps Greatly; Doctors Might Not Have to Pay</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 22nd (CNA) â€“ The White House recently said that the fee to apply for an H-1B visa will increase to $100,000. However, some people might not have to pay this fee if it is good for the country. News today says that doctors might be one group who will not have to pay.</p>
            <p>On September 19th, Donald Trump signed an order. This order raised the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000 (about NT$3.02 million). This new rule is now active.</p>
            <p>Reuters reports that a Bloomberg News reporter wrote on social media platform X. The reporter quoted White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. Rogers said that doctors might be included in the group that does not have to pay the fee.</p>

            <h1>Japanese City Limits Daily Phone Use to 2 Hours for Everyone</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, September 22nd (CNA) â€“ The city council in Toyoake, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, today voted yes on a new rule. This rule says people should not use smartphones and similar devices for more than 2 hours a day. This does not include time used for work, studying, or housework. This is the first rule in Japan that limits screen time for all citizens. It will start on October 1st. However, the rule is not strong; there are no punishments if people do not follow it.</p>
            <p>The Nikkei and Yomiuri newspapers reported that the Toyoake city government said smartphones are now important for daily life. But using them too much can cause people to not sleep enough. It can also mean less time with family, affect home life, and stop children from growing well. Because of these reasons, the city government gave the city council this draft rule. It asks people to use smartphones, tablets, and game consoles for less than 2 hours a day when not working or doing chores.</p>
            <p>The city council voted on this draft rule this afternoon. Out of 19 council members (not including the speaker), 12 voted for it and 7 voted against it. So, it passed with a majority of votes.</p>
            <p>The Toyoake city government said this is the first rule in the country that sets a goal for smartphone use for all citizens. It will begin on October 1st.</p>
            <p>This rule is for all citizens. It also applies to children under 18 who go to school in the city. For children, there are also suggested times for using these devices: elementary school students until 9 PM, and middle school students and older until 10 PM. Families are also asked to set their own rules. The rule has no power to make people follow it, and there are no fines.</p>
            <p>The city council also passed an extra decision. This decision said that "2 hours a day" is just a suggestion. It respects different ways of living and family situations. It also said that information should be given to citizens carefully and clearly to avoid misunderstandings. Lastly, the council said the rule's effects should be checked regularly, and changes should be made if needed.</p>
            <p>Masanao Kobuki, the mayor of Toyoake City, said after the rule passed that "under 2 hours" is not a strict rule, but just a guide.</p>
            <p>The Mainichi newspaper reported that the idea for this rule came from a city government meeting in June this year. In that meeting, there was a report that some children who did not want to go to school were staying up all night because they used their phones too much. They could not even go to help centers. Mayor Kobuki wanted to find a solution before September, when school starts and more children might not want to go to school. So, he presented the draft rule at a city council meeting on August 25th.</p>
            <p>Some people inside the government were worried about a "flame war" or strong criticism because of this rule. However, one staff member explained that if they only gave "guidelines," it might be too weak, and no one would pay attention. So, they chose to make it a "rule" to get people talking about it.</p>
            <p>After the news of the rule passing came out, there was a lot of criticism on social media. Some internet users said, "This is the government getting involved too much" and "It's meddling." Some felt that even if the government made a standard, no one would listen. They thought how phones are used should be decided by each family or person, based on age. However, some parents thought it was a good idea. They believed it could help them teach their children and stop them from becoming "addicted to phones."</p>
