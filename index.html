            <h1>A Family of 8 Said They Had Mental Illness to Get Over 50 Million NT Dollars in Insurance; They Are Found Not Guilty.</h1>
            <p>A woman named Ms. Chang and 7 family members were accused of telling psychiatrists they had mental problems to stay in the hospital. They were trying to get 55.7 million NT dollars from insurance. They were charged with a crime. But the first court said there was not enough proof. The court believed the mental problems might be because of family history. So, they were found not guilty. Today, the second court also said they are not guilty, and this decision is final.</p>
            <p>This case started when a prosecutor from Taipei heard about Ms. Chang's family trying to get insurance money in a wrong way. The prosecutor was at a meeting about finance and crime prevention. So, the prosecutor told the Investigation Bureau to look into it. The National Health Insurance Administration also gave medical records and helped understand them.</p>
            <p>In 2020, the Taipei Prosecutors' Office finished its investigation. They believed that Ms. Chang, her husband, her daughter, and 5 other family members, a total of 8 people, pretended to have mental issues to mental doctors. They managed to stay in the hospital and then claimed over 55.7 million NT dollars from insurance. So, they were charged with fraud.</p>
            <p>The first court, the Taipei District Court, decided there was not enough evidence. They said all 8 people were not guilty. The court also shared 7 main reasons for their decision in a press release. One important reason was that all 8 people were diagnosed with mental illnesses by doctors and were put in the hospital. Also, each hospital has its own rules and steps for deciding who needs to be in the hospital.</p>
            <p>The case went to a higher court, the Taiwan High Court. Today, the second court said that one of the 8 people died in January this year. So, the charges against that person were dropped. The other 7 people are still found not guilty. This means the case is now closed.</p>
            <p>The second court said that the accused people were all sent to the hospital by their own doctors. The doctors decided they needed to be in the hospital for observation, treatment, or recovery. The court found it hard to believe that all the doctors made mistakes because the accused people tricked them.</p>
            <p>Also, the second court asked two hospitals, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital and Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, to check the medical records of the accused. The court wanted to know if they were faking or making their illnesses sound worse, and if they really needed to be in the hospital. But both hospitals refused to do this check.</p>
            <p>The second court said there was no other strong proof to show that the doctors and medical teams were tricked into putting the accused in the hospital for observation, treatment, or recovery. So, the court could not agree that the accused people committed the fraud that the prosecutor said they did. The prosecutor asked the court to change the decision to guilty, but the court said no. The case is now officially finished.</p>

            <h1>China's Real Estate Market is Slow, Sales are Half of What They Used to Be</h1>
            <p>(CNA Reporter Li Ya-ya, Shanghai, July 17) China's economy is growing slower, and it has many problems with its real estate market. New information shows that in the first half of this year, the size and value of new homes sold in China dropped a lot. Compared to the best time, which was the first half of 2021, sales are now almost half.</p>
            <p>Recent numbers from China's National Bureau of Statistics show that from January to June this year, the total area of new commercial buildings (including homes and business places) sold was 458.51 million square meters. This is 3.5% less than last year. The total money from these sales was 4.4241 trillion Chinese yuan (about 17.68 trillion New Taiwan dollars). This is 5.5% less than last year.</p>
            <p>The best time for China's real estate market in recent years was in 2021. The numbers show that in the first half of 2021, the area of new commercial buildings sold was 886.35 million square meters, which was 27.7% more than the year before. The total money from sales was 9.2931 trillion yuan, which was 38.9% more.</p>
            <p>In the first half of this year, both the area and value of new commercial buildings sold dropped very fast compared to the first half of 2021. The sales area went down by 48.2%, almost half. The sales value went down by 52.3%, meaning sales were cut in half.</p>
            <p>In the first half of 2021, the money invested in real estate building in China was very high, 7.2179 trillion yuan. But in the first half of this year, the money invested was only 4.6658 trillion yuan. This is a big drop of 35.3%.</p>
            <p>Guosheng Securities released a report on July 16. It said that the money invested in real estate building started to go down in April 2022. In the first half of this year, the investment dropped by 11.2% compared to last year. This is the biggest drop in this period. The report said that building companies are starting fewer new projects mainly because sales are low and it's hard to get money.</p>
            <p>Sheng Laiyun, who is a deputy head at China's National Bureau of Statistics, spoke on July 15. He said that different areas and government groups have been trying to make the real estate market stable this year. They are following the central government's plans. Looking at the numbers, he said the market is moving towards "stopping the fall and becoming stable again."</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheng also said that prices are falling less quickly. Also, it's becoming easier for real estate companies to get money. They are also working to pay off their debts in an orderly way. And the number of unsold homes has been going down for four months in a row. He said that even though the area of homes sold and prices are still going down year by year, this is a normal part of the market changing and finding its lowest point.</p>

            <h1>Women's Football Blood Test Case: Chen Chi-mai Says Government Must Punish By Law</h1>
            <p>(CNA Reporter Lin Chiao-lien, Kaohsiung, July 17) There is a case about Chou Tai-ying, a former famous player and coach for Taiwan's National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's football team. She was accused of forcing players to give blood for research. Today, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai said that NTNU was very wrong. He said the government should punish them strictly by law. He added, "These are people, not animals for experiments. Even animal experiments need approval steps."</p>
            <p>The NTNU women's football blood test case is still a big problem. Today, when Mayor Chen Chi-mai was at a ceremony for a new building at Kaohsiung Vocational High School, he was asked about the case. With a serious face, Mayor Chen said that NTNU acted very wrongly. He believes the university president did not do enough to protect the students. He said the school should be responsible for keeping students safe, but they let this problem continue for a long time. He said, "I strongly disagree with how they handled it."</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen also said that the school broke the law. For blood test research, there must be a review by a Human Research Ethics Committee (IRB). Only medical workers should take blood, and the research should be done with medical organizations. He said what happened seriously broke the Human Research Act and the Medical Care Act. It also seemed like bullying in the school. So, he said the government must punish them strictly according to the law.</p>
            <p>"These are people, not animals," Mayor Chen said. "This was a human experiment, not an animal experiment. It's very unbelievable that they did things so badly." He stressed that even animal experiments need review steps. The school should have checked things carefully at every step. He said the school accepted money from the government but did not do its job well or check things properly. So, they should be punished strictly by law.</p>
