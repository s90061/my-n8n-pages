            <h1>KMT and TPP Congratulate Sanae Takaichi, Hope for Deeper Exchange</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 4 (CNA) Sanae Takaichi has won the election to become the head of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). She might become Japan's first female prime minister. Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) have congratulated her. They hope to continue to have closer communication with the LDP. Many lawmakers from both ruling and opposition parties have shared photos with Sanae Takaichi. They hope she will follow former Prime Minister Abe's ideas and help Taiwan and Japan become even better friends.</p>
            <p>The results of Japan's LDP leadership election were announced today. Sanae Takaichi won against her opponent Shinjiro Koizumi in the second round of voting. She is now the 29th head of the LDP. She may be chosen by the Japanese Parliament to become the first female prime minister in Japan's history.</p>
            <p>Yang Chih-yu, a spokesperson for the KMT, said that the KMT sincerely congratulates Sanae Takaichi on becoming the LDP leader. The KMT hopes to continue to build on the friendship of many decades between the two parties and have deeper talks under Takaichi's leadership.</p>
            <p>The TPP said in a statement that they offer their sincere good wishes to Sanae Takaichi. Japan is a long-time friend of Taiwan. The TPP hopes there will be more chances for communication in the future to make the friendship between Taiwan and Japan stronger.</p>
            <p>Many lawmakers also posted photos with Sanae Takaichi on social media and sent their congratulations. Wang Ting-yu, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said in both Chinese and Japanese that with Sanae Takaichi leading, who follows Abe's ideas, the friendship between Taiwan and Japan could become even better. This is very good news.</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Chiu Yi-ying said that Sanae Takaichi visited Taiwan in April this year with a group. Chiu Yi-ying talked with Sanae Takaichi about Taiwan-Japan relations, safety in the region, and working together on trade. Chiu Yi-ying thanked Takaichi for always helping Taiwan and Japan be friends and strongly supporting democracy.</p>
            <p>Chiu Yi-ying also said that Sanae Takaichi strongly believes in the plans of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Chiu Yi-ying believes that under Takaichi's leadership, Taiwan and Japan will work together and communicate more closely. Chiu Yi-ying will do her best to make Taiwan and Japan good friends to create a future that is rich and peaceful for both.</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Chen Kuan-ting said that Sanae Takaichi's win shows that people in Japan are very worried about safety in the region. China's military power is growing clearly. Japanese voters and political leaders agree more than ever. They chose Sanae Takaichi because her views are very clear.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuan-ting said that Taiwan and Japan should use this important chance. They should move from being good friends to being strategic partners with real plans. They should first work more closely on new types of security. For economic cooperation, Taiwan's strength in the semiconductor industry and Japan's plan for economic safety can work together very well. They can build strong technology and safe supply chains for democratic countries.</p>

            <h1>Chen Chi-yu's Appeal Rejected; Held Again in Taipower Green Energy Case</h1>
            <p>Tainan, October 4 (CNA) The Tainan District Court decided on September 26 to keep Chen Chi-yu, the former chairman of Taipower Green Energy, and two other people in custody for another two months. This is the third time they have been held. Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang, the former general manager of Taipower Green Energy, did not agree with this decision and filed an appeal. Today, the Tainan High Court rejected their appeal.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang are involved in a case about breaking securities trading laws. They did not agree with the Tainan District Court's decision to hold them for a third time, so they appealed. Today, the Tainan Branch of the Taiwan High Court rejected their appeal. This decision cannot be appealed again.</p>
            <p>The Tainan High Court believes that Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang might still run away or try to avoid punishment. Also, not all witnesses they asked for have been questioned completely. The court thinks Chen and Su have some power over the witnesses. This means they could unfairly influence them to work together or destroy evidence, which could lead to wrong judgments. Also, Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang might still try to work with others involved or with witnesses to destroy evidence, so they can get out of trouble or get a lighter sentence.</p>
            <p>The Tainan District Prosecutors Office is looking into problems with the Taipower Green Energy company's solar power projects. On February 27, they charged Chen Chi-yu and four other people. Because Chen Chi-yu said he did not do anything wrong, the prosecutors asked for him to be sentenced to 12 years in prison. They asked for Su Kun-huang to be sentenced to 10 years. For the former deputy general manager of Taipower Green Energy, Mr. Kuo, Su Chun-jen, and the owner of Chaoyang Development Company and Weicheng Development Company, Mr. Dai, the prosecutors asked for a suitable punishment.</p>
            <p>After the case was sent to court, the Tainan District Court decided on February 28 to hold Chen Chi-yu, Su Kun-huang, and Su Chun-jen without visits or communication. Mr. Kuo, the former deputy general manager of Taipower Green Energy, and Mr. Dai, the owner of Chaoyang Development Company and Weicheng Development Company, were released on bail of NT$3 million each. They were not allowed to change their homes, leave the country, or go to sea. They also had to be watched with special electronic devices.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-yu and the two others asked to be released on bail. On September 22, the Tainan District Court decided they could be released on bail for NT$4 million to NT$6 million. They were not allowed to change their homes, leave the country, or go to sea, and they had to be watched by electronic devices. Chen Chi-yu and the others completed the bail process on September 24. However, the Tainan Prosecutors Office quickly appealed. On September 25, the Tainan High Court cancelled the original decision and sent the case back to the Tainan District Court. The Tainan District Court then decided to hold them for another two months for the third time, from September 28 to November 27. They are also not allowed to have visits or communicate with anyone.</p>

            <h1>Hamas Ready to Talk About Other Issues After Saying They Will Release Hostages</h1>
            <p>Jerusalem, October 4 (CNA) The Palestinian group Hamas told AFP today that they are ready to start talking about all remaining problems. This is about the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip that US President Trump suggested.</p>
            <p>A high-ranking Hamas official, who did not want to be named, said: "We are ready to start talks right away to solve all issues."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Hamas said they are ready to let go of all hostages held in the Gaza Strip. However, Hamas did not reply to calls for them to give up their weapons and leave the Gaza Strip after the war.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a group that works with Hamas, also said today that they support Hamas's answer to the US plan to stop the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group was part of Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Now that they agree with the US plan, it might help get the hostages held by them and Hamas released.</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Islamic Jihad said in a statement: "Hamas's response to Donald Trump's plan shows the position of all Palestinian resistance groups. We took part in the talks to make this decision in a responsible way."</p>
            <p>Also, a high-ranking Hamas official told AFP today that Egypt will organize a meeting with different Palestinian groups. They will decide about the future of the Gaza Strip after the war.</p>
            <p>The official said that Egypt will lead an "internal Palestinian discussion to talk about Palestinian unity and the future of Gaza, including how the Gaza Strip will be managed."</p>
