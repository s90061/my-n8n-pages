            <h1>South Korean President: North Korea is almost ready to hit the US with nuclear missiles</h1>
            <p>The President of South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, said in New York today that North Korea is working on developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that can carry nuclear weapons and hit the United States. He said they are almost finished with this development, but they still need to perfect the technology for the missiles to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere safely.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that President Lee made these comments at an event to attract business at the New York Stock Exchange. He was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. He also said that he would try his best to reduce the security risks related to North Korea to bring more investments to South Korea and help its economy grow.</p>
            <p>President Lee explained that North Korea "keeps developing ICBMs that can hit the United States, and can carry a nuclear bomb to attack the US." He believes they are doing this either to talk with the US or to make their government stronger.</p>
            <p>He also said that North Korea has not fully succeeded yet, but they are in the last steps. The only thing left is the technology for the missiles to come back into the atmosphere, and this part "will probably be solved soon."</p>
            <p>Last year, North Korea tested its largest ICBM, the Hwasong-19, which flew very high into space. Experts at that time said such a missile could hit any target in the US. However, people still doubted if North Korea could control the missile well and protect its warhead when it re-enters the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>President Lee stated that Pyongyang clearly has enough nuclear weapons to keep its government safe. He asked for talks to stop North Korea from making and selling more nuclear weapons. He also repeated that US President Donald Trump would be "the only one" who could talk with North Korea.</p>

            <h1>Paraguay President: It is time to fix old unfairness, Taiwan should join the UN</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's friends are speaking louder at the 80th United Nations General Assembly. Paraguay's President, Santiago Peña, said it is time to remove unfairness that has lasted for decades and give Taiwan (Republic of China) a place in the United Nations. The President of the Marshall Islands, Hilda C. Heine, also said that UN Resolution 2758 does not say who should sit in the UN with the country's nameplate.</p>
            <p>The main discussions at the UN General Assembly started on September 23. US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have already spoken. Leaders from Taiwan's diplomatic allies and other countries that support Taiwan also gave speeches about the situation in the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's involvement in the United Nations.</p>
            <p>Paraguay's President Peña spoke for two minutes on September 24 about his country's friendship with Taiwan and Taiwan joining the UN. Since becoming president, Peña has spoken at the UN General Assembly three times about Taiwan.</p>
            <p>President Peña said that Paraguay is proud to have had diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan) for 67 years. He said this relationship is built on shared democratic values and cooperation, not just on benefits. He admitted that this decision has economic costs. But he added, "Believe me, doing the right thing has no price."</p>
            <p>He mentioned that Paraguay is very worried about the increasing tension in the Taiwan Strait. More aggressive military exercises, constant intrusions into Taiwan's airspace, and strong statements are making the situation more dangerous. This not only makes East Asia unstable but also affects peace around the world.</p>
            <p>President Peña said, "Everyone should not be afraid. Taiwan must have a place in this forum (the United Nations). I say again, Taiwan must have a place in this forum. This is about fairness. The UN system excluding Taiwan goes against the purpose of the organization. 23 million good, hardworking, and kind people are still treated as if they do not exist in the world's many organizations."</p>
            <p>He said that Taiwan's issues and its role in the world must be part of the Assembly's discussions. He believes now is the time to remove the old unfairness that has lasted for decades and give Taiwan (Republic of China) a place in the United Nations.</p>
            <p>President Hilda C. Heine of the Marshall Islands has also often spoken at the UN General Assembly about why Taiwan needs to be included.</p>
            <p>She said on September 24 that Taiwan, an island nation, is still kept out of important international activities by the UN system. She noted that Taiwan plays an important role for the Marshall Islands and the world in technology cooperation, promoting peace in the area, and making development sustainable. However, she said UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 is still wrongly described as a UN rule about "one China." She stated that the UN has never manipulated things in such a misleading way.</p>
            <p>President Heine said that the resolution does not decide who should sit at the UN with the country's nameplate. It also does not give power or legal right to anyone to take away the independence of a democratic country by force or pressure. She stressed that the UN Secretariat must stop treating people with Taiwan passports, including journalists, unfairly.</p>
            <p>She said that all member countries must understand that these actions, which are wrongly based on Resolution 2758 and are influenced by politics, along with any military invasion or forceful actions against Taiwan, are against international law and justice.</p>

            <h1>Shooting at a school in Northeast Brazil kills 2 teenagers</h1>
            <p>In Sobral, a town in the Ceara state in northeast Brazil, a shooting happened today in a school parking lot. Two teenagers were shot and died, and three other people were hurt.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the Ceara state government said in a statement, "The shooter fired on the school sidewalk, and the bullets hit the victims in the school parking lot." They also said, "One victim was found to have some drugs, a special electronic scale, and packaging materials on them."</p>
            <p>Police sources told AFP that there was more than one shooter, and they were riding motorcycles.</p>
            <p>Elmano de Freitas, the governor of Ceara state, wrote on social media platform X about this "unacceptable" violent event. He said he was "very sad" and had told the police to send more officers to the area to "find the criminals."</p>
            <p>In recent years, drug gangs have grown quickly in the poorer northeast areas of Brazil. Brazil is now dealing with more and more gang fights.</p>
