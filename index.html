            <h1>US and France Strengthen Joint Military Satellite Operations to Counter China's Space Power</h1>
            <p>A senior US general told Reuters that France and the United States are planning a second joint mission. This mission will help them work together to move satellites in space. This is part of how the two countries are making their ability to gather information stronger, especially as China is increasing its military presence in space.</p>
            <p>This operation will be the third known mission where the Pentagon and its allies work together in space. Late last year, the United States and France worked together for the first time. They moved two satellites together in space. Also, earlier this month, the US Space Command did a joint mission with the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Space is becoming a place where countries compete more and more in the military. Many satellites are very important for talking, warning about missiles, and getting information on battlefields. These satellites are now in danger from the main space powers in the world. China, Russia, and the United States have all shown anti-satellite weapons. They have also sent spacecraft into space that can move around. This makes people worried that if there is a fight, attacks could stop GPS navigation or cut off communication that soldiers on the ground need.</p>
            <p>Controlling spacecraft more accurately and working together with international friends has become very important. Officials call this a new global space race. The United States and its friends are facing strong competition from China and Russia.</p>
            <p>US Space Force Lieutenant General Douglas Schiess told Reuters in an interview, "We are now planning an operation with France." General Schiess leads a group that works with the US Space Command and handles secret military space operations. He did not give more details.</p>
            <p>France spends the most money on space in Europe. He said that in the future, there might be more operations with other countries. He added, "I think we can do even more."</p>
            <p>Military space officials from Western countries like Europe, the United States, and Canada have been warning lately. They say that threats to satellites in space are growing. This includes military satellites and commercial groups of satellites like SpaceX's Starlink, which hundreds of millions of people around the world use.</p>
            <p>The French Space Command did not want to comment on any plans. When they talked about the first operation, the French Space Command said they were training with the United States. This was to make their teamwork better, learn how to work together, and "show their strong unity."</p>
            <p>The French Space Command stressed that they "must be ready for military space operations in real situations."</p>
            <p>Recently, in Paris, Major General Vincent Chusseau, who leads the French Space Command, was asked by Reuters about the first operation. He did not give many details but said, "We think this operation was very successful."</p>
            <p>In April this year, General Stephen Whiting, who leads the US Space Command, said something important. He said the first joint operation was called "Rendezvous and Proximity Operations." During this time, military satellites from both the US and France moved close to a satellite of a "strategic competitor." Last week, when General Schiess was interviewed, he did not say which country the third nearby satellite belonged to.</p>
            <p>The UK said that during a second operation from September 4 to 12 last year, a satellite controlled by the US Space Command moved. It moved to check if the UK military communication satellite, SKYNET 5A, was working as it should in space. The UK government said both satellites were in geostationary orbit, about 36,000 kilometers from Earth. They moved at a speed of about 3 kilometers per second.</p>
            <p>The UK and the US did not say the name of the US satellite that took part in the operation. However, a company called Comspoc, which makes software to understand what is happening in space, said something. They saw a US spy satellite, USA 271, that can move very well. This satellite came close to the UK's SKYNET 5A between September 5 and 11.</p>
            <p>Last week, Major General Paul Tedman, who leads the UK Space Command, announced this operation. He said it was the first time his team had done a mission like this. He said it "means our ability to operate has become much better." He also added, "We can now do advanced space operations with our friends. This is to protect and defend our shared national and military interests in space."</p>

            <h1>Legislative Yuan Convener Election: DPP Gets 8, KMT 7, TPP 1 Seat</h1>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan chose conveners for its 8 regular committees. All 8 committees chose their conveners by nominating them. The Kuomintang (KMT) party gave up its turn to choose a convener for the Education and Culture Committee. Instead, it let Liu Shu-bin, a lawmaker from the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), become the convener. The results of the election were: the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) got 8 conveners, the KMT got 7, and the TPP got 1.</p>
            <p>The fourth session of the 11th Legislative Yuan started recently. Today, they held elections for the conveners of the 8 regular committees. The rules say that each regular committee has two conveners. Conveners can decide what topics the committee will discuss. In the new session of the Legislative Yuan, they will check the budget again. Because of this, getting a convener spot in each committee is very important for all political parties.</p>
            <p>The election results for the Internal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan were that Wang Mei-hui from the DPP and Huang Chien-pin from the KMT were chosen as conveners.</p>
            <p>For the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee, Chuang Jui-hsiung from the DPP and Weng Hsiao-ling from the KMT were chosen as conveners.</p>
            <p>For the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, Wang Ting-yu from the DPP and Ma Wen-chun from the KMT were chosen as conveners.</p>
            <p>For the Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee, Liu Chien-kuo from the DPP and Liao Wei-hsiang from the KMT were chosen as conveners.</p>
            <p>For the Education and Culture Committee, Chen Hsiu-pao from the DPP and Liu Shu-bin from the TPP were chosen as conveners.</p>
            <p>For the Transportation Committee, Lee Kun-tse from the DPP and Hung Meng-kai from the KMT were chosen as conveners.</p>
            <p>For the Economic Committee, Chen Ting-fei from the DPP and Yang Chiung-ying from the KMT were chosen as conveners.</p>
            <p>For the Finance Committee, Lee Kun-cheng from the DPP and Lin Szu-ming from the KMT were chosen as conveners.</p>
