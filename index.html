            <h1>US-Russia Summit to Take Place; Trump: Ukraine to Decide on Territory Exchange</h1>
            <p>The US-Russia meeting is about to happen. Today, US President Trump said that they will talk about exchanging land between Russia and Ukraine. But he said that Ukraine must make its own decision. His reason for being there is to get Ukraine to the meeting table. Trump also said he wants Russia and Ukraine to stop fighting very soon. He said, 'If it's not today, I will be unhappy.'</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for almost three and a half years. This morning, Donald Trump flew to Anchorage, Alaska's biggest city. Later, he will have a one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin to talk about the issues between Russia and Ukraine. This will be the first time the current presidents of the US and Russia have met since 2021.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to reporters on his plane, Air Force One. He said the talks would include the idea of exchanging land. But he said Ukraine must decide for itself, and he thinks Ukraine will make the 'right decision.'</p>
            <p>He said, 'I am not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I am here to get them to the negotiation table.'</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said his meeting with Putin would be 'a very good meeting.' But he added that a second meeting would be more important. This would be a three-way talk between Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and himself. He also said, 'Maybe we will invite some European leaders too.'</p>
            <p>Today, he stressed that he wants Russia and Ukraine to stop fighting as soon as possible. 'If not today, I will be unhappy,' he said. His goal in helping with the talks is to stop the killing.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked about Russia still attacking Ukraine with drones just before the US-Russia meeting, Trump replied. He said maybe Putin thought this would make him stronger in the talks. But Trump believes this is not good for Putin, and he will bring it up in the meeting.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump said that the US might work with Europe to give security help to Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Trump-Putin Summit About to Start; Zelenskyy Accuses Russia of Still Killing on Day of Talks</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump and Russian President Putin both flew to Alaska. They will have an important meeting there. This meeting will test if Trump can keep his promise to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. But Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said that Moscow is still killing people on the day of the meeting.</p>
            <p>According to news reports, both Trump and Putin said they hope this meeting will be helpful. But Trump warned that if Putin does not give in at all, he might think the talks have failed just a few minutes after they start. The Kremlin, on the other hand, said the two leaders expect to talk for 'at least' 6 or 7 hours.</p>
            <p>For Putin, this meeting in Alaska is the first time he has been in a Western country since he ordered a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
            <p>In recent days, Russia has made big gains in the war. This might give Putin a strong position in any talks to stop the fighting.</p>
            <p>On his way to Anchorage on Air Force One, Trump told reporters in a positive way: 'Both sides have some respect. I think some results will come out.'</p>
            <p>Leaders in Europe and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be watching their every move closely. Zelenskyy was not part of these talks. He has openly said no to Trump's pressure for Ukraine to give up land taken by Russia.</p>
            <p>Hours before the Trump-Putin meeting, Zelenskyy said today that Moscow is still killing people and has not shown any desire to end the war.</p>
            <p>In a video he posted on social media, he said: 'Moscow has not given any orders or any signs to end the war... They are still killing on the day of the talks.'</p>
