I am sorry, but I am unable to fetch the news URLs from Taiwan. The `news_url` tool is consistently returning an error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parts')". This prevents me from proceeding with the rest of your request, including reading the articles with Tavily and translating them.
