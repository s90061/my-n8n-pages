            <h1>Mexico President: US Delays High Tariffs, Preserving North American Agreement</h1>
            <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said today that US President Trump's decision to delay higher taxes on Mexican products "saved" the current North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum talked with Trump. After their talk, she said in a morning meeting with reporters that Mexico got the best deal possible. Other countries also face new US import taxes.</p>
            <p>She also said that both governments are close to finishing a safety agreement. This agreement will help stop illegal drugs from crossing the border and prevent guns from going from the US to Mexico.</p>
            <p>Trump said Mexico is not doing enough to stop illegal drugs. He wrote on his social media, "Truth Social," that he "agreed to extend our exact same agreement from a short time ago for 90 days."</p>
            <p>Some Mexican goods that are not part of the USMCA trade agreement currently have a 25% tax from the US.</p>
            <p>During his first time as president, Trump successfully changed the trade agreement. This led to the USMCA agreement starting in July 2020. It replaced the old NAFTA agreement. The three countries will look at the USMCA again next July.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum agreed with Trump's praise for the USMCA trade agreement. She called it "one of the best trade agreements ever" and "the only way we can compete with Asian countries, especially China."</p>
            <p>In 2023, Mexico became the biggest trading partner for the US, taking China's place. More than 80% of Mexico's exports go to the US.</p>

            <h1>Trump's Special Envoy to Visit Gaza, Meet Residents, Inspect Aid Distribution</h1>
            <p>US President Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will go to Gaza tomorrow. He will check how aid is being given out and meet with people who live in war-torn Gaza. US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee will go with him.</p>
            <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: "Special Envoy Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee will go to Gaza tomorrow. They will look at the places where aid is currently being given out. They will make sure there is a plan to provide more food. They will also meet with local people in Gaza to hear firsthand about the difficult situation there."</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, organizations that watch world hunger have warned that people in Gaza are facing hunger. Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today. He is trying to save the talks for a ceasefire in Gaza and help with the human crisis there.</p>
            <p>Soon after Witkoff arrived in Israel, Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social": "The quickest way to end the human crisis in Gaza is for Hamas (a Palestinian Islamic group) to give up and let the hostages go!"</p>

            <h1>China Questions H20 Chip Security Risks, Nvidia Denies 'Backdoors'</h1>
            <p>China had concerns about possible safety problems with the H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chip made by Nvidia, a big chip company. Today, Nvidia said that its products do not have "backdoors" that allow anyone to get remote access or control.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that China's internet safety office, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), said it was worried. This is because the US suggested that advanced chips sent to other countries should have ways to track and find them. The US had just allowed Nvidia to start selling H20 chips to China again. But today, the CAC talked to Nvidia and asked about the risks. This has made it unclear if Nvidia can send chips to China.</p>
            <p>The CAC said they are worried about Chinese users' data and privacy. So, they asked Nvidia to explain if the H20 chip has any backdoor safety risks.</p>
            <p>An Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement, "Internet safety is very important to us. Nvidia chips do not have 'backdoors' that let anyone get remote access or control."</p>
            <p>The White House and both parts of the US Congress have suggested that US chip companies should put location checking technology in their chips. This is to stop chips from being sent to countries where US law says they cannot be exported. These proposed laws and White House ideas are not yet official rules, and no technical requirements have been made.</p>
            <p>Nvidia has been a main point of discussion in the relationship between the US and China. In April this year, the US stopped Nvidia from selling H20 chips to China. They only allowed it again in July. The US put rules on advanced AI chip exports at the end of 2023. Because of this, Nvidia made the H20 chip especially for the Chinese market.</p>
