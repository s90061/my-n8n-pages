            <h1>Trump Blames Democrats for Possible Government Shutdown, Threatens Many Job Cuts</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, leaders from both the Democratic and Republican parties met with President Trump and other important people at the White House. But they could not agree on how to stop the government from closing. Today, Republican President Trump said the government might close. He blamed the Democratic Party because they want to give health insurance to immigrants who are in the country illegally. He also said that if the government closes, many people might lose their jobs.</p>
            <p>The government's money for spending runs out today. News in the US says that both Republicans and Democrats still have different ideas. They cannot agree on a spending bill before October 1st, which is the start of the new financial year. So, the government will close.</p>
            <p>The Democratic leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives said that both sides still disagree a lot. They said, "If the government closes, it's because the Republican Party chose to stop the government, which will hurt American people."</p>
            <p>However, President Donald Trump spoke to the media today at the White House. He said, "We might have a government shutdown." He criticized the Democratic Party for wanting to give health insurance to immigrants who are in the country illegally. He believes this will make more illegal immigrants come to the US.</p>
            <p>The Republican Party wants to pass a "clean" temporary spending bill first. This bill would just keep the government spending money at the current level for seven weeks to stop a shutdown. The Democratic Party wants to add rules to the bill. These rules would extend health care tax help to make sure that some important social programs do not stop because their money runs out.</p>
            <p>Trump said that the Democrats want the government to close. He said, "We do not want the government to close." He added that a lot of money is being invested in the US right now. "We are the ones who least want the government to close," he stated.</p>
            <p>He warned that if the government closes, "we can do things that will hurt them, and they cannot change these things back." For example, he said they could fire many people or cut programs that Democrats like. He said Democrats are taking a risk by letting the government close. But during a shutdown, "we can take action in health care and other areas."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "We do not want fraud, waste, and misuse of money." He said the government has been working to reduce these problems. But he claims the Democrats want immigrants who are in the country illegally to come to the US and receive a lot of health care. He said other people would have to pay for this.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that Trump's government has a plan ready for a shutdown. This plan includes the Department of Labor stopping most of its work and firing thousands of employees. National parks will close, and their workers might also lose their jobs. The IRS phone service will not be answered, and it might even stop working forever.</p>
            <p>However, in big cities like Washington D.C. and Memphis, the National Guard will continue to be present. Actions against illegal immigrants, like raids and removals, will also continue. Law enforcement officers will work without pay at first.</p>
            <p>According to US news, the last time the US government closed was during Trump's first time as president. The main reason was issues with immigration. The shutdown lasted from December 22, 2018, to January 25 of the next year. It was 35 days long, making it the longest government shutdown in US history.</p>

            <h1>Worries About Rising Prices Make US Consumer Confidence Drop to Five-Month Low in September</h1>
            <p>New information shows that people in the US felt less confident in September. This is the lowest confidence level since President Donald Trump put new taxes on all imported goods in April. People who were asked questions are more and more worried about prices going up (inflation).</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that the Conference Board in the US announced the consumer confidence index for September was 94.2. This is 3.6 points lower than the corrected number for August, which was 97.8. It is also lower than what experts from Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal had expected.</p>
            <p>Stephanie Guichard, an important economist at the Conference Board, said that people who answered the survey talked more about prices and inflation in September. This shows that these two things are again the main worries for consumers about the economy. She also said that people still care about import taxes, but less than they did in August.</p>
            <p>Guichard also pointed out that what consumers expect for inflation in the next 12 months went down a little. It was 6.1% in August and is now 5.8%. However, this is still higher than it was at the end of last year.</p>
            <p>Since Trump came back to the White House and started his policy of import taxes, prices in the US have slowly been rising. He put high taxes on goods from both friendly countries and countries he sees as rivals. He did this to change how the US trades with other nations.</p>
            <p>Even with this, Trump and his economic team keep saying that the rise in prices is not very big. They have asked the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower interest rates quickly to help the economy.</p>

            <h1>Trump's First Win in Drug Price War: Pfizer Agrees to Lower Medicine Prices</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump announced that the government has made a deal with Pfizer. The company agreed to lower its medicine prices by choice. This is part of the government's plan to link US medicine prices to lower prices in other countries.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, Donald Trump said that Pfizer will do several things to lower medicine prices in the US. This includes selling existing medicines to people who receive Medicaid (a government health insurance for low-income people) at the "most favored nation" price. This means the lowest price offered in other developed countries. Also, for new medicines Pfizer makes in the future, they will promise the same "most favored nation" price for Medicare (government health insurance for people over 65), Medicaid, and private insurance companies.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Pfizer has agreed to offer some of their most popular medicines at prices from half off to completely free for our consumers." He added that these medicines will be available to buy directly online.</p>
            <p>Trump also shared that he is talking with other medicine companies about similar deals. The Associated Press reported that this agreement is a response from medicine companies. Trump had asked 17 companies by the deadline of the 29th to promise to lower prices. This request was officially sent to the main medicine companies in late July.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Trump added that Pfizer will invest 70 billion US dollars to build new medicine manufacturing factories in the US.</p>
            <p>Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, was at the press conference. Pfizer released a statement today confirming that they have reached a medicine price agreement with Trump.</p>
            <p>Sources told CNBC reporter Angelica Peebles that the deal also includes a three-year delay on planned taxes for medicines. This delay will happen as long as Pfizer continues to build medicine factories in the US.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, after this news became public, Pfizer's stock price went up by 5% when the market opened today.</p>
            <p>In May this year, Trump signed an executive order. This order brought back a debated policy called "most favored nation" treatment. He aimed to greatly lower US medicine prices by linking the cost of some medicines to much lower prices in other countries.</p>
            <p>This agreement comes at a time when medicine companies are feeling pressure from Trump's government. The government plans to put new taxes on imported medicines.</p>
