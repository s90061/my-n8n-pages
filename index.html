            <h1>Directors of Nuclear Power Plant No. 2 and Linkou Power Plant Accused of Taking Bribes, Ordered to Remain in Custody</h1>
            <p>The director of Nuclear Power Plant No. 2, Zeng Wen-huang, and the director of Linkou Power Plant, Zhu Yun-zhong, have been accused of taking bribes. They were charged with corruption. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office moved the two men, who were already held, to the Taipei District Court today. The court decided this evening to keep them in custody for another three months.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office found that during his time as director of Nuclear Power Plant No. 2, Zeng Wen-huang received bribes of NT$1.6 million and then NT$200,000 from a man named Cao when handling a purchasing project last year. Also, in April last year, he received NT$400,000 from a man named Hao for another purchasing project.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors also found that Zhu Yun-zhong, who has been the director of Linkou Power Plant since January 2019, was good friends with Mr. Hao. The two agreed that Mr. Hao would be the only one to get certain projects at the Linkou Power Plant. After Zhu Yun-zhong helped Mr. Hao win the projects, he received 5% to 10% of the project's final price as a kickback. In total, he received NT$800,000 in bribes.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office charged Zeng Wen-huang, Zhu Yun-zhong, and Mr. Hao with taking bribes for their official duties, according to the Anti-Corruption Act. Mr. Cao admitted his guilt during the investigation and showed deep regret. He also provided full information about the facts, which helped to make the case clear. Because of this, the prosecutors decided not to charge Mr. Cao for two years, but he must pay NT$1.5 million to the public treasury.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's GDP Per Person Expected to Pass US$40,000 Next Year for the First Time</h1>
            <p>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) shared its economic predictions today. It believes that Taiwan's economy will grow by 4.45% in 2025 and 2.81% in 2026. Because the economy is growing bigger and the New Taiwan Dollar is becoming stronger, the average GDP per person will go over US$40,000 next year for the first time, reaching US$41,019.</p>
            <p>According to DGBAS information, Taiwan's GDP per person first went over US$30,000 in 2021. Since then, it has continued to grow. It is expected to pass US$40,000 by 2026.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cai Yu-tai, who is in charge of the general statistics department at DGBAS, explained that two main things will help the GDP per person go over US$40,000 next year. First, the total size of the economy will keep growing. Second, the New Taiwan Dollar will become more valuable.</p>
            <p>Even though former U.S. President Trump started a trade war, which caused many unsure times for the world and Taiwan's economy, Mr. Cai Yu-tai said that the demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is very strong. This has made exports do well and is an important reason for the economy's good performance.</p>
            <p>As the economy grows, the total value of goods and services produced in the country (GDP) gets bigger. Also, because the New Taiwan Dollar gets stronger, the GDP per person can go above US$40,000.</p>
            <p>However, DGBAS also warned about five big things that could affect Taiwan's economy. First, how U.S. tariffs will affect trade, prices, and supply chains. Second, how AI and high-speed computing technology will develop and be used, and what infrastructure will be needed. Third, how Taiwan's money plans and policies will help reduce the effects of tariffs. Fourth, how global political situations will affect the world economy and prices. Fifth, how the money policies of important countries will affect financial markets and the real economy. These things need to be watched carefully.</p>

            <h1>Intel's Stock Price Rises Over 4% Before Market Opens Due to News of Possible U.S. Government Investment</h1>
            <p>Today, Intel's stock price went up by 4.6% in early trading before the U.S. stock market opened. This happened after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump government was talking about possibly investing in Intel, a big chip company that is having problems.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this news came out after former U.S. President Donald Trump met with Intel's CEO, Chen Li-wu, this week. Mr. Trump had recently asked Mr. Chen Li-wu to resign because of his investments linked to China.</p>
            <p>Intel did not want to comment on the Bloomberg report.</p>
            <p>Also, Intel's shares on the Frankfurt stock market in Germany went up by 3.6% today.</p>
            <p>Intel used to be the clear leader in making computer chips. However, in recent years, it has lost its top position. Its market value has fallen sharply from US$288 billion in 2020 to US$104 billion.</p>
            <p>For many years, Intel has been trying to improve its situation. If they reach any agreement and get some money, it will greatly help Intel.</p>
