            <h1>S&P 500 and Nasdaq Reach New Highs; Advisors Say Taiwan Stocks Will See Money Move Around</h1>
            <p>People hope the U.S. central bank will lower interest rates, which made American stocks go up a lot. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq index reached their highest points ever. Nvidia and TSMC's shares in the U.S. went up a little. On August 12, Taiwan's stock market went up by 22.86 points, closing at 24158.36 points. Investment experts say that big AI companies that don't have to pay high taxes are making Taiwan's stock market index go higher and higher. They think that money will soon move to other stocks that are currently cheaper.</p>
            <p>Even though people were worried about taxes that former US President Trump put on goods, prices in the U.S. stayed mostly the same in July. This made people hope more that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. American stocks all went up at the end of the day. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq reached new highs, and the Dow Jones also went up by almost 500 points.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 483.52 points, or 1.10%. The S&P 500 index went up by 72.31 points, or 1.13%. The Nasdaq index went up by 296.51 points, or 1.39%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up strongly by 169.72 points, or 2.99%.</p>
            <p>Nvidia's stock price went up a little by 0.55%, closing at 183.16 US dollars. TSMC's American shares (ADR) went up by 0.91%, closing at 244.29 US dollars.</p>
            <p>On August 12, Taiwan's stock market went up by 22.86 points, closing at 24158.36 points. The total value of shares traded was 420.044 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Large institutional investors sold 6.101 billion New Taiwan Dollars more than they bought. Among these, trading firms bought 478 million more than they sold, investment trusts bought 50 million more than they sold, and foreign and mainland Chinese investors sold 6.629 billion more than they bought.</p>
            <p>Investment analysts said that the rise in US consumer prices in July was as expected. The chance of interest rates being lowered in September is still over 90%. This made the Dow Jones in the US stock market go up sharply. More than 90% of US company reports for the second quarter are out, and 80% of companies earned more money than expected. This helps keep American stocks strong and high.</p>
            <p>Analysts said that in Taiwan's stock market, the main index keeps going higher. On August 12, it reached 24263.92 points during the day, which is close to its highest point ever of 24416 points. However, only about 26.5% of individual stocks are above their yearly average price. Right now, the index is going up mostly because of big AI companies that don't have to pay high taxes. In the short term, they expect money to move to other stocks that are not directly helped by these tax rules and have lower starting prices.</p>

            <h1>US Media Shows How Countries Talked with Trump: Lobbyists Failed, But Leaders Meeting Him Worked Better</h1>
            <p>Many foreign governments spent a lot of money to try and convince Donald Trump to lower taxes on goods, but most of them didn't succeed. An article from Politico magazine showed different ways countries tried to influence Trump. It said the best way to talk to Trump was for a country's leader to meet him face-to-face. The President of Mexico is a good example of this. Cambodia, on the other hand, used a law firm to connect with a top person in the trade office, and in the end, their taxes were greatly reduced.</p>
            <p>This year, many countries quickly hired lobbyists who were close to former US President Trump. They wanted to protect their country's interests as the new government was changing world trade rules. However, most of them still had to pay higher taxes.</p>
            <p>Looking at the latest results, Trump set a 15% tax on goods from major trade partners. For other countries around the world, he set taxes between 10% and 41%. The usual ways of influencing people in Washington, D.C., did not seem to work well.</p>
            <p>American political news site Politico reported on August 9 that since the US presidential election last year, at least 30 countries have hired lobbyists connected to Trump. These include big trade partners like South Korea and Japan, and smaller countries like Bosnia and Ecuador. However, hiring these lobbyists did not clearly help countries avoid high taxes.</p>
            <p>Mukesh Aghi, who leads a lobbying group called the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, said that the current leaders in Washington, D.C., seem to be changing the usual way of doing things. The old methods do not seem to work anymore, and the new methods are causing problems for India.</p>
            <p>Even though India hired Jason Miller in April, who has been Trump's advisor for a long time, India was still badly affected by Trump's taxes in the past two weeks.</p>
            <p>Because the US and India could not agree on a trade deal, and because Trump decided to add many more taxes because India bought oil from Russia, India's taxes are expected to go up to 50%.</p>
            <p>Based on documents given to the U.S. Department of Justice, India signed a one-year contract with Miller for 1.8 million US dollars (about 53.9 million New Taiwan Dollars). This was for advice on strategy, planning, help with government relations, managing public image, and public relations services.</p>
            <p>The situations with Canada and Mexico are very clear. Different parts of Canada hired many lobbyists, but they were still hit hard by Trump's taxes. Mexico did not do this. Instead, its President, Claudia Sheinbaum, used her personal connection with Trump. This direct way of talking worked better.</p>
            <p>Mexico played a more direct part in the issue of powerful pain relievers like fentanyl coming into the US. But in the end, Canada, to the north, faced higher taxes. Taxes on Canadian goods are now 35%, while Mexico's remain at 25%. Also, most Mexican products are free from taxes because of current free trade agreements.</p>
            <p>A Republican lobbyist who worked on Trump's tax issues said that to make progress with Trump, you need to think differently.</p>
            <p>He talked about the successful case of the Mexican President and suggested not being against Trump. He said, "A better way is to think this: The President wants to change the trade relationship between the two countries. That is his goal, and you must work with him within his plan."</p>
            <p>It is especially important for leaders to talk directly to Trump about their position. Lobbyist Tami Overby said, "In my opinion, the best way to talk to President Trump and influence him is for a leader to meet him in person, face-to-face."</p>
            <p>"President Trump always seems to like to talk about his relationships with other leaders. No matter if our country has a good relationship with that country or not, he will decide based on whether he feels he has a good relationship with the other person. And he sees himself as someone who makes deals happen."</p>
            <p>Many companies hired by foreign governments before Trump became president were very important in Washington's lobbying world. Many countries hired experienced trade lobbyists or people connected to Trump even before the US presidential election.</p>
            <p>This includes Mercury Public Affairs, a company that used to be the office for White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on K Street, known for lobbying in Washington. Since last November, this company has signed agreements with five new foreign governments, including South Korea, Ecuador, and Libya.</p>
            <p>Mercury Public Affairs also worked to influence for the Japanese government. Japan hired more than 20 lobbying and public relations companies in the US. Japan was one of the first main partners to sign a trade agreement with the US, and its taxes on goods went down from 25% at first to 15%.</p>
            <p>According to documents given to the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Ballard Partners, which used to be the company of former U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, helped set up a phone call between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the second day after the U.S. election.</p>
            <p>Another lobbying company close to Trump, BGR Group, has signed six new foreign government clients since Trump won the election last year.</p>
            <p>Some of these clients, like Angola and South Korea, saw their taxes decrease between April and August. However, this company also received 300,000 US dollars to lobby for the Indian government, but most of that work was about the growing tension between India and Pakistan.</p>
            <p>Some Southeast Asian countries that hired lobbying companies did better. Many of them got lower taxes compared to the first taxes announced in April. However, these taxes were still higher than before, and generally higher than in other regions. In other words, lobbyists might have helped clients avoid the worst situation, but it is hard to say it was a real victory.</p>
            <p>Countries like Cambodia hired American lobbying companies to get closer to the Trump government. They also worked with business groups that talked to lower-level officials in the Trump government's Commerce Department and Treasury Department.</p>
            <p>Documents from the U.S. Department of Justice show that on the same day Trump announced his new taxes, the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP in Washington, D.C., contacted Sam Mulopulos, a top assistant at the U.S. Trade Representative's office, on behalf of the Cambodian government.</p>
            <p>The documents show that in the following months, the law firm sent many messages to Mulopulos to arrange meetings with Cambodian negotiators, get updates on tax talks, and set up meetings with members of Congress, like Republican Representative Adrian Smith.</p>
            <p>In the end, Cambodia's taxes went down from 49% to 19%. This was one of the biggest tax reductions for any country.</p>
            <p>The Trump government described the countries that got the biggest tax cuts as partners who were willing to give in the most. A former diplomat who worked with different governments in Southeast Asia said that representatives from Vietnam set up more than 20 meetings with government officials. After Trump announced his new taxes, the number of these meetings increased.</p>
            <p>Vietnam achieved a small win, as its tax rate went down from 46% to 20%. However, Vietnamese officials said that the final number was still higher than the rate they first agreed on. An Asian diplomat thought that the lobbying by Southeast Asian countries changed the Trump government's first trade plan. This plan was to pull Southeast Asia out of Beijing's influence and mainly stop China's actions like falsely labeling where goods came from and other law enforcement issues.</p>
            <p>Also, many countries started working with lobbying companies for the first time. These companies made money by using their connections with Trump or people close to him.</p>
            <p>This year, the government of Pakistan hired seven new lobbying companies. These included companies owned by Keith Schiller, Trump's former bodyguard, and George Sorial, a former manager at the Trump Organization. Before this, neither of them had registered as foreign agents. But Pakistan agreed to pay them 50,000 US dollars each month as part of their contract.</p>
            <p>In the end, Pakistan's taxes went down from 29% to 19%. This is a clear difference compared to India, its long-time rival.</p>
            <p>Also, documents from the U.S. Department of Justice show that foreign governments like Guyana and Japan signed contracts with the lobbying company "Continental Strategy" this spring. Guyana pays Continental Strategy 50,000 US dollars each month, and its tax rate went down from 38% in April to 15% in August.</p>
            <p>"Continental Strategy" is led by Carlos Trujillo, a diplomat who worked in Trump's first government, and Alberto Martinez, a former high-level assistant to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>

            <h1>Prepare for Strong Winds and Heavy Rain as Typhoon Approaches; Eastern Taiwan and South of Chiayi Most Affected</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration said that today, during the day, will be the time with the strongest wind and rain from Typhoon Yang-liu. The eastern part of Taiwan, areas south of Chiayi, and Penghu will be affected the most. There will be heavy rain or very heavy local rain. Especially in Hualien, Taitung, and the southern mountains, there is a chance of very heavy rain or more.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration said that Typhoon Yang-liu, which is typhoon number 11, has gotten a bit stronger. Its center is now in the sea southeast of Taitung and is moving northwest. The area of strong winds around the typhoon has already reached the sea near southeastern Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration said that at 6 AM today, the typhoon's strong wind area reached the land of Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula. The wind and rain in eastern Taiwan will get much stronger. Around noon, the typhoon's center is expected to land in Taitung. The wind and rain will be strongest during the day. The eastern part of Taiwan, areas south of Chiayi, and Penghu will be affected the most, with heavy rain or very heavy local rain. Hualien, Taitung, and the southern mountains have a chance of very heavy rain or more.</p>
            <p>For areas north of Yunlin, and also Kinmen and Matsu, there will be local, short periods of showers or thunderstorms. In mountain areas, there's a chance of local heavy rain. The Weather Administration asks everyone to prepare for the typhoon and pay attention to the latest weather updates it shares.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration said that tonight, the typhoon's center will move to the west of Penghu and then go towards mainland China. Its strength will slowly become weaker. Tonight, the wind and rain on Taiwan's main island will become less. Only Penghu and Kinmen will still have strong wind and rain.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, the Weather Administration said that areas south of Chiayi and the eastern part of Taiwan will have high temperatures of about 27 to 30 degrees Celsius. Areas north of Yunlin will still feel hot and stuffy because of warm air coming down from mountains. Temperatures there will be 32 or 33 degrees Celsius or higher. From Miaoli to Changhua and in Kinmen, there is a chance of local high temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. People in these areas should drink more water.</p>
            <p>Because of the typhoon and the winds around it, the Weather Administration said that some parts of Taitung (including Green Island and Orchid Island) will have average winds of level 12 or gusts of level 14 or higher. Some parts of Yunlin, Hualien, and Penghu will have average winds of level 9 or gusts of level 11 or higher. Other areas may also have average winds of level 6 or gusts of level 8 or higher. From tonight until early tomorrow morning, Kinmen County also has a chance of average winds of level 9 or gusts of level 11 or higher.</p>
            <p>The wind and waves in all sea areas will get much bigger, with waves possibly reaching over 4 meters high. Especially along the coasts of eastern and southeastern Taiwan, waves could be over 6 meters high. There is a chance of long waves along the North Coast of Keelung, eastern Taiwan (including Orchid Island and Green Island), the Hengchun Peninsula, and Matsu. People must be very careful and avoid going to the beach.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment's air quality forecast says that today, because of the typhoon and its surrounding winds, the central and Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan areas are on the leeward side, so pollutants may build up a bit. In the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan area, stronger winds might cause dust from the ground to rise, so pollutant levels might be higher for a short time. The air quality in Hsinchu-Miaoli, Kaohsiung-Pingtung, Yilan, Hualien-Taitung, and Matsu, Kinmen, and Penghu is "good." The air quality in the northern, central, and Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan areas is "normal." For more details, check https://www.moenv.gov.tw.</p>
