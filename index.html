            <h1>Dali Train Station in Yilan Now Has Elevators and Ramps</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Railways Company spent more than NT$68.06 million. They built three elevators and an accessible ramp at Dali Station in Toucheng Township, Yilan County. These new facilities opened today, September 23, providing a more welcoming and comfortable place for travelers.</p>
            <p>The opening ceremony took place at Dali Station at 11 AM. Important guests attended, including Mr. Liu Shuang-huo, Deputy General Manager of Taiwan Railways, Mr. Chen Chun-yu, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party, and Ms. Chen Wan-hui, the head of the Taiwan People's Party in Yilan County.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways said that Dali Station first opened on December 10, 1920. On the east side of the station is Dali Old Street, which is near the ocean. On the west side is Dali Tiangong Temple, which is built on a mountain. In the past, people living on Dali Old Street had to use an underground path south of the station to get to the train. They had to walk along Provincial Highway 2, which has a lot of traffic. This was not easy and also dangerous.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways also said that on holidays, many people visit Tiangong Temple or hike the Caoling Historic Trail. These visitors often use the station platforms. For older travelers and people with walking difficulties, a station manager would help them use a special path. However, this path was not very convenient or safe for them.</p>
            <p>So, to help with the needs of an aging population, Taiwan Railways decided to make improvements. They spent over NT$68.06 million to make Dali Station more accessible. They built three elevators and added an accessible ramp entrance at the back of the station. They also fixed handrails, renewed the ground on the stairs, and added more lights and security cameras. These changes will help residents and people with disabilities use the train more easily.</p>

            <h1>US Says Iranian Diplomats Cannot Buy Luxury Items at Costco</h1>
            <p>The US government under President Trump has made a new rule. Iranian diplomats who work or visit New York cannot shop at big stores like Costco. They also cannot buy expensive luxury items in the United States. They need special permission from the US State Department first.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the State Department explained its decision. They said, "We will not allow leaders from the Iranian government to shop freely in New York. At the same time, the people in Iran are suffering from poverty, broken public services, and a severe lack of water and electricity."</p>
            <p>This week, a formal announcement will be made. The US State Department said that for diplomats, being a member of a big warehouse store like Costco is a "benefit." Also, buying things like watches, fur, jewelry, handbags, wallets, perfume, tobacco, alcohol, and cars are also "benefits." These things now need approval from the US government.</p>
            <p>This rule is only for Iran. Stores like Costco were very popular with Iranian diplomats who lived in or visited New York. They could buy many products there that were not available in Iran, and at lower prices. They would then send these items back home.</p>
            <p>The State Department clearly stated, "We want to send a strong message. When the United States says we support the people of Iran, we are serious. We are stopping Iranian officials from using their visits to the UN to get things that ordinary Iranian people cannot get."</p>
            <p>This new rule is part of other changes by the Trump government. They are making visa rules stricter for leaders and diplomats who want to work at the United Nations.</p>
            <p>Important leaders from around the world are meeting at the UN this week for a big yearly event. However, these new US rules will apply all year to any Iranian diplomat who works at the United Nations.</p>
