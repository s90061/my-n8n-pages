            <h1>Russia Attacks Kyiv at Night, Ukraine Says 8 People Hurt, Including a Child</h1>
            <p>Kyiv officials said today that Russia attacked the capital city during the night. Eight people living in an apartment building were hurt, and one of them was a 3-year-old child.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the attack happened soon after midnight on July 27. Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military office, said on Telegram that four of the injured people are in the hospital. One person is very seriously hurt.</p>
            <p>Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said that all the injured people lived in a tall apartment building in the Darnytskyi area, on the left side of the Dnipro River.</p>
            <p>Klitschko wrote on Telegram, "The explosion's force broke windows on floors 6 to 11."</p>
            <p>Kyiv and most of Ukraine were under air raid warnings for several hours during the night. This happened after the Ukrainian air force warned about Russian missile and drone attacks.</p>
            <p>Poland's army quickly sent out planes to protect its airspace. This was because areas in western Ukraine, near Poland, were in danger of missile attacks. Poland is a member of NATO.</p>
            <p>Kropyvnytskyi, a city in central Ukraine, was also attacked. Andriy Raikovych, the governor of Kirovohrad region, said that emergency workers are there. More information about possible damage will be shared later today.</p>
            <p>It is not yet fully clear how big this Russian attack was. Reuters workers in Kyiv heard loud explosions all night. It sounded like the air defense system was working.</p>
            <p>Russia has not yet said anything about this attack. Both Russia and Ukraine say they do not target regular people in the war, which started in February 2022.</p>
            <p>The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused thousands of regular people to die. Most of them are Ukrainian citizens.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang: The Democratic Progressive Party's Responsibility Cannot Be Solved by a Senior Party Worker Resigning</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Chen Chun-hua, Taipei, July 28) After the big recall election failed, Lin Yu-chang, the Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), resigned today. Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), said that how the DPP handles responsibility inside their party is their own business. But he added that the DPP's duty to the country, society, and all Taiwanese people cannot be fixed just by one senior party worker leaving their job.</p>
            <p>The first wave of recall attempts against 24 Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an (who is suspended) all failed. DPP lawmaker Chen Chao-tzu wrote on Facebook that if the DPP changes its attitude and shows goodwill, it should immediately let Ko Wen-je go, handle cases legally, and stop political interference. Also, it should accept the parliament's reforms that have passed into law and quickly pass the surrogacy law. If these things happen, the TPP and DPP could build a new relationship and work together on some issues.</p>
            <p>This morning, Huang Kuo-chang was interviewed. He said that people have clearly and loudly responded to the DPP's big recall efforts. He has already made an official statement, asking President Lai Ching-te to say sorry to everyone right away. He also asked Premier Cho Jung-tai to step down and for the whole government to be changed. He said that the head of the DPP group in parliament, Ko Chien-ming, should know when to leave. Huang believes this is the political responsibility the DPP must take.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the DPP has caused serious divisions in Taiwanese society recently, and this has cost a lot. He said the TPP puts the country's good before its own party's good or personal good. He added that the TPP is happy to work with all political parties on any laws that help the country and its people.</p>
            <p>Regarding the failed recall attempts, Lin Yu-chang, the DPP Secretary-General, said today that as the ruling party, the DPP is responsible. He already told President Lai Ching-te yesterday that he wanted to resign. Huang Kuo-chang was interviewed by Huang Kuang-chin on the program "Noon Time Focus." He said that Lin Yu-chang's resignation only matters to the DPP. He explained that a secretary-general is an internal party job. He added that how the DPP assigns blame internally is their own private matter, and "I don't care about it at all." He repeated that the DPP's responsibility to the country, society, and all Taiwanese people cannot be fixed by one senior party worker resigning.</p>
            <p>About Chen Chao-tzu's post, Huang Kuo-chang said that anything not agreed upon or discussed by everyone is just a personal opinion. He said it's fine for each lawmaker to have some ideas or views. He made the TPP's stance very clear on the day the votes were counted: the DPP must take the most serious political responsibility.</p>
            <p>Also, the media reported that Huang Kuo-chang played a key part in the big recall attempts. Future cooperation between the KMT and TPP might include supporting Taichung Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen to become the head of the KMT. This could be in return for a candidate for New Taipei City Mayor in 2026, or even a "Lu-Huang" team for the 2028 presidential election.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that for New Taipei, he will work hard himself to be the best choice. As for the KMT, he said the TPP and he personally are open and friendly to discussing how to combine efforts. The final goal is to make sure President Lai leaves office in 2028. Therefore, he does not want New Taipei City to be controlled by the DPP in 2026, as this would make the bigger goal for 2028 harder to reach.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said he will not tell the KMT what to do inside their party and respects their internal democratic process. He has a good relationship with Lu Hsiu-yen and they work well together. He noted that Lu Hsiu-yen worked very hard on the recall attempts for the three young lawmakers in Taichung. He said that it is "not proper for me, and I will definitely not comment on this" regarding whether the KMT will choose a new leader or who wants to run for it.</p>

            <h1>Man Gets 1 Year and 4 Months in Prison for Hitting Girlfriend's 4-Year-Old Son, Causing Broken Bones; Decision Is Final</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Lin Chang-han, Taipei, July 28) A man named Zang Jun-hao was accused of hitting his girlfriend's 4-year-old son, who was from her previous marriage. He also picked the boy up and hit him against a wall, causing many broken bones. In the first two trials, Zang was sentenced to 1 year and 4 months in prison. The Supreme Court recently rejected his appeal, making the decision final.</p>
            <p>The court documents show that Zang was dating a woman named Chen. Chen had a son from her earlier marriage. On February 25, 2024, in the early morning, Zang lost control for an unknown reason. He hit the boy's head, face, and chin with his hands. He then grabbed the boy and hit him against a wall. This caused the boy to have many broken bones, bruises, and cuts on his body.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the director of the boy's kindergarten noticed something was wrong. She saw that the boy was throwing up, had a bump on his head, and clear bruises. He was quickly sent to the hospital. After brain surgery, his life was saved. When the Tainan City Social Affairs Bureau found out, they told the police and prosecutors. The Tainan District Prosecutors Office then started an investigation and brought charges.</p>
            <p>The first trial decided that Zang was guilty of hurting a child on purpose, which is a crime for adults. So, his sentence should be harsher according to the Children and Youth Welfare and Rights Protection Act. The court considered that Zang did not control his emotions and caused the boy serious physical and mental harm. This was a very serious situation. Also, Zang and Ms. Chen reached an agreement to settle the matter. Because of all this, he was sentenced to 1 year and 4 months in prison.</p>
            <p>Zang appealed, saying that he had followed the agreement and also paid money to the boy's grandmother, who was taking care of him. He asked for the sentence to be changed. The Tainan High Court thought that the boy still needs special therapy and recovery now. The court found that the first trial's sentence was fair, so they rejected Zang's appeal. The Supreme Court decided that the earlier sentence was correct and recently rejected his appeal. This means the case is now officially closed.</p>
