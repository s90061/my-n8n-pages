            <h1>Rally to Support 5 KMT Lawmakers in Taipei; Huang Kuo-chang: Use Your Vote on July 26 to Send a Message to Lai Ching-te</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) held a rally today in front of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) headquarters. They were supporting five Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers from Taipei who might be removed from their jobs. TPP Chairman Huang Kuo-chang said that on July 26, people should vote against removing these lawmakers. He said this would show President Lai Ching-te that the people are in charge of the country. He also said it would remind the DPP and teach Lai Ching-te a lesson.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, the Taiwan People's Party held an event called "Democratic Uprising! Anti-Recall to Win, Taiwan to Win" in front of the DPP central office. Eight TPP lawmakers from the Legislature were there. They also invited KMT lawmakers from Taipei, including Lai Shyh-bao, Lee Yen-hsiu, Wang Hung-wei, Hsu Chiao-hsin, and Lo Chih-chiang.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi, the wife of former TPP chairman Ko Wen-je, spoke at the event. She said it was her first time publicly speaking against this large-scale recall effort. She explained that in a democratic society, it is normal for opposition parties in the parliament to watch over the ruling party. She added that if the opposition lawmakers make decisions that the ruling party does not like, they should not be removed from their jobs. She called this "Green Communist" behavior, meaning it is like a strict rule by one group. This is why she strongly supports stopping the recall.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi thanked everyone for supporting the TPP's event. She hoped more people would talk about going to vote against the recall on July 26. She said, "I will go vote, and I hope my husband will go with me to Jin'ou Commercial High School to vote against the recall." She also said she would ask a lawyer to help Ko Wen-je get his right to vote.</p>
            <p>Lai Shyh-bao said that in most countries, the ruling party does not try to remove many lawmakers without good reason. He said only Taiwan is doing this. He thinks it's because the DPP has fewer seats and loses votes often, so they started this big recall effort. He stated that July 26 is not just about the recall vote, but it is a fight between democracy and authoritarian rule.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei said that opposition parties must work together to have power and watch over the government. She thanked the TPP and KMT lawmakers for working closely against the ruling party. She said they are united to fight the DPP at this important time. She believes this large recall effort is not democratic; it is a political fight. She urged people to vote against the recall on July 26 to teach the DPP and Lai Ching-te a lesson, so the DPP loses again.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chiao-hsin said that they must not let the efforts of the KMT and TPP over the past year disappear. She noted that this big recall is aimed at KMT lawmakers. She mentioned that "Little Grasses" (a term for TPP supporters) could just watch, but they chose to come out and support their shared political ideas. She thanked everyone for their kindness and said she would never forget it.</p>
            <p>Lo Chih-chiang spoke to the crowd, asking them to let Ko Wen-je vote and to protect his right to vote. He questioned how much the government would try to disrespect Ko Wen-je. Lee Yen-hsiu said that everyone must stand up to show the DPP that Taiwan's democracy is not controlled by the DPP. She urged people to vote "no" to Lai Ching-te on July 26, stating that the people are the true bosses.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, who spoke last, asked why President Lai sees people who disagree with the DPP as "impurities." He said President Lai should not think that having bodyguards and security means he can avoid this question. Huang said, "As long as you are in the Presidential Office, the people have the right to ask you to explain clearly why we are 'impurities'?"</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said this recall is not just about one lawmaker. He explained that this large, harmful recall is meant to tell the people of Taiwan that the DPP does not want to be watched by anyone. He believes the DPP wants only its own voice to be heard in Taiwan. He warned that if Lai Ching-te gets his way, Taiwan will become something everyone dislikes. He stressed that protecting Taiwan's democracy means protecting the future of the next generation.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that political parties can compete, criticize, and debate. However, he stated that Taiwan is a democratic country, and the ruling party must not be allowed to ruin it. He urged people to vote against the recall on July 26. He said this would tell Lai Ching-te that the people are the true owners of the country and would remind and teach the DPP and Lai Ching-te a lesson.</p>

            <h1>If Liberal Democratic Party Loses in Japan's Upper House Election, Shigeru Ishiba Might Be Forced Out of Power</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, July 20, CNA) Japan is holding its 27th election for the Upper House (House of Councillors). The final results are expected by late night. The main question of the election is whether the ruling parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito (together called LDP-Komeito), can keep more than half of the seats in the Upper House. After the votes are counted, Japanese media predict the LDP might lose. If this happens, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba could be forced to step down. This Upper House election will be a major turning point for Japanese politics.</p>
            <p>Voting for Japan's Upper House election ended today at 8 PM local time (7 PM Taipei time), and counting started right away. The LDP-Komeito alliance is a "minority ruling party" in the Lower House (House of Representatives). A key point of this election is whether they can win 50 seats.</p>
            <p>Around 8 PM tonight, top party leaders, including LDP Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama and Election Strategy Committee Chairman Seiji Kihara, arrived at the LDP headquarters. Their faces looked serious.</p>
            <p>Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) reported that the LDP is expected to win only 27 to 41 seats this time. A former minister told NHK that if the LDP-Komeito alliance cannot keep more than half of the seats in the Upper House after this election, Prime Minister and LDP President Shigeru Ishiba should resign. The main reason is that if they lose this Upper House election, it would be their third loss. They already lost the Lower House election last autumn and the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election this summer.</p>
            <p>Japan's Upper House has 248 seats. Lawmakers in the Upper House serve for six years. Every three years, half of the seats, or 124 seats, are re-elected. This time, 125 seats will be elected. This includes 74 seats from election districts, 50 seats through proportional representation, and 1 seat from a by-election in Tokyo.</p>
            <p>The LDP has 62 seats that are not up for re-election, and Komeito has 13. Together, they have 75 seats. So, if the LDP-Komeito alliance wins 50 seats in this Upper House election, they will have more than half of the seats in the Upper House. Before this election, the LDP-Komeito alliance had 66 seats that were being re-elected. Even if they lost 16 seats, they would still have more than half of the seats in the Upper House.</p>
            <p>Since the year 2000, the LDP-Komeito alliance has failed to win 50 seats in the Upper House election only once. This happened in 2007, when the ruling party lost badly during the first Abe government.</p>

            <h1>Executive Yuan: Final Budget Surplus Is Not Too Much Money Collected; Local Leaders Should Not Confuse People</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 20, CNA) Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said that the central government collected over NT$520 billion more than expected last year and should quickly give NT$10,000 to everyone. Executive Yuan spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said that local leaders are familiar with the Public Debt Act. They understand that there is no such thing as "over-collection." She also stated that collecting more money than planned does not mean it is the "final budget surplus." She hoped local leaders would not confuse the public.</p>
            <p>Regarding whether to give NT$10,000 in cash to everyone, Premier Cho Jung-tai recently said that if they were to do this, they would need to borrow about NT$101.4 billion. He said this made him feel uncertain.</p>
            <p>Media reports say that Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an stated today that the central government collected over NT$520 billion more than expected last year, and NT$1.8 trillion over four years. He hopes the government will give NT$10,000 to the public quickly, as required by law. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said that the central government collected NT$528.3 billion more in taxes last year. She thinks that after giving NT$10,000 to everyone, there should still be over NT$200 billion left. However, she noted that Premier Cho Jung-tai said there was only a little over NT$30 billion left from the extra taxes. She asked where the rest of the money went.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih said in a press release today that she believes local leaders understand the financial reports. She explained that the over NT$500 billion collected in 2024 (Year 113) is a national total that includes both central and local government money. By law, local governments will receive over NT$70 billion. Also, some money must be put into funds. The central government actually only has NT$375.7 billion.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih pointed out that out of the NT$375.7 billion, over NT$190 billion must be used to pay off debts first, according to Article 12 of the Public Debt Act and other rules. Because of this, the budget surplus for 2024 (Year 113) is expected to be only NT$164.1 billion. This amount has already been added to the central government's total accumulated budget surplus of NT$443.6 billion. The Executive Yuan plans to use NT$410 billion of this total for a special law to make the country safer and stronger.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih said that local leaders have many years of experience in government. They should be familiar with rules like the Public Debt Act. They should also understand that there is no such thing as "over-collection." She added that collecting more money than planned does not mean it is the "final budget surplus." She hoped local leaders would stop confusing and misleading the public.</p>
