Libraries across the English-speaking world are seeing a surprising rise in visitors. Many are reporting record numbers of people coming through their doors, indicating a shift in how communities use these public spaces. This trend suggests that libraries are becoming more than just places to borrow books; they are turning into important "third spaces" where people can connect, learn, and find support.

These modern libraries offer a wide range of services beyond traditional reading. Visitors can often find free internet access, job search assistance, computer training, and various community events. As the cost of living increases, people are looking for affordable or free places to spend time outside of their homes and workplaces. Libraries provide a warm, safe environment where anyone can go without needing to spend money.

Experts believe this growing popularity is also linked to the need for social connection and mental well-being. In a world where many feel isolated, libraries offer a sense of community. They help bridge the "digital divide" by providing access to technology for those who might not have it at home. This makes libraries vital hubs for people looking for both information and social interaction in their daily lives.

**Workers Resist Commute with "Quiet Quitting" Trend**

A new trend called "quiet quitting commuting" is emerging as many employees push back against returning to the office full-time. This phrase describes how workers are finding ways to avoid long commutes, even when their companies ask them to come into the office. Instead of openly refusing, they might come in less often than requested, work from home on a day they are supposed to be in the office, or find excuses to leave early.

For many, the appeal of working from home remains strong. Employees report that working remotely saves them significant time and money they would otherwise spend on commuting. It also offers a better work-life balance, allowing them to manage personal responsibilities more easily. Some workers also feel more productive at home without the distractions of a busy office.

On the other hand, many companies are eager for their staff to return to the office. They believe that in-person collaboration improves teamwork, strengthens company culture, and helps justify the cost of office buildings. This difference in opinion is creating ongoing tension between employers and their teams, as both sides try to find a working solution that suits their needs.

**Venice Introduces Entry Fee for Day-Trippers**

Venice, Italy, has started charging a 5-euro entry fee for day visitors on certain busy days. This new rule, which began as a trial in April, aims to manage the huge number of tourists who visit the famous city each year, a problem often called "overtourism." The fee applies mainly during peak times, such as weekends and public holidays, when the city becomes very crowded.

The payment is required for visitors who do not stay overnight in Venice. Residents of Venice, people visiting family, and those with hotel reservations are exempt from paying the fee. Day-trippers must book their visit online in advance and receive a QR code, which they might be asked to show at certain entry points. If visitors don't have a valid QR code, they could face a fine.

City officials hope this measure will help protect Venice's delicate environment and historical sites, while also improving the quality of life for its residents. The introduction of the fee has received mixed reactions, with some supporting the effort to preserve the city and others worrying about its impact on tourism.`;
