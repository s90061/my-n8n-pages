        const text = `**The Rise of "Quiet Quitting": Are Workers Really Disengaging?**

The term "quiet quitting" has become incredibly popular recently, sparking debates about workplace engagement and employee motivation. It describes the practice of employees doing exactly what their job description requires, and nothing more. They're not actively sabotaging the company, but they're also not going above and beyond, working late, or taking on extra responsibilities.

Instead of complete disengagement, experts suggest it represents a response to burnout and feeling undervalued. Many workers feel they've been pressured to work harder and longer without adequate compensation or recognition. Quiet quitting, therefore, becomes a way to set boundaries and protect their mental health.

Some employers worry this trend signals a decline in productivity and commitment. However, others see it as an opportunity to rethink workplace culture and focus on creating a more supportive and rewarding environment for employees. This could involve better compensation, improved work-life balance, and more opportunities for professional development. Ultimately, the conversation around quiet quitting highlights the need for a renewed focus on employee well-being and fair treatment in the workplace.

**Dutch City of Utrecht Embraces Car-Free Living with Innovative Infrastructure**

Utrecht, a city in the Netherlands, is gaining recognition for its commitment to reducing car use and promoting sustainable transportation. The city has invested heavily in infrastructure that prioritizes cycling and walking, aiming to create a more livable and environmentally friendly urban environment.

A key element of Utrecht's approach is its extensive network of cycle paths, including the world's largest bicycle parking facility beneath the central train station. This underground garage can accommodate over 12,500 bicycles, encouraging commuters to cycle to the station and then take public transport.

Furthermore, the city is redesigning streets to give pedestrians and cyclists more space, making walking and cycling safer and more attractive options. By prioritizing sustainable transportation, Utrecht aims to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and create a more pleasant environment for residents and visitors alike. The city's efforts serve as an example for other urban areas looking to create more sustainable and livable communities.
