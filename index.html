            <h1>Doctors Ask for Help to Quit Heated Tobacco, Flavored Products Not Allowed in Stores</h1>
            <p>The National Health Agency has approved heated tobacco products with some rules. Doctors say heated tobacco is still tobacco, and all tobacco is bad for health. So, other rules are very important. Shops should not show heated tobacco, and flavored heated tobacco should be strictly forbidden. In the future, money from taxes on heated tobacco should be used to help people stop using heated tobacco.</p>
            <p>The new Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act started more than two years ago. It completely banned e-cigarettes and strictly controls new tobacco products like heated tobacco. It also added a system to check health risks.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare's National Health Agency recently shared the newest results of these checks. Eight products from company A and six products from company B have been conditionally approved and sent to the companies.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wen Chi-Pang, who started the Taiwan Medical Alliance for Tobacco Control, spoke at a big meeting about tobacco control today. He said heated tobacco is just like old-style cigarettes and has no good points. He was not happy that heated tobacco, which has many things that cause cancer, was approved. He also asked why supermarkets are allowed to sell things that cause cancer. Heated tobacco has nicotine, so people can easily get addicted without knowing it. He thinks allowing heated tobacco makes no sense at all.</p>
            <p>Dr. Guo Fei-Ran, a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital, said heated tobacco is tobacco, and all tobacco is harmful. He mentioned a study in Japan by a Canadian university that showed heated tobacco does not reduce harm. Even if someone smokes less, from 20 cigarettes to 1, the risk is still 1.5 times higher. Risks only go down to the level of non-smokers if people stop using all tobacco products. Also, 90% of heated tobacco users end up using both heated tobacco and regular cigarettes.</p>
            <p>Dr. Guo said that if strict rules and related support are conditions for approval, they must be truly followed. Otherwise, they might just be empty promises. Quitting heated tobacco is the same as quitting regular cigarettes. Heated tobacco is still a tobacco product and has nicotine, so it still involves smoking. In the future, heated tobacco will be taxed. So, the government should use some of this tax money to help people quit heated tobacco.</p>
            <p>Ms. Lin Ching-Li, who is in charge of the Tobacco Control Center at the John Tung Foundation, said that since the government has approved heated tobacco with conditions, it should immediately announce a ban on all flavored tobacco products, except those that taste like plain tobacco. Flavored heated tobacco products that were approved should have their approval taken away. Heated tobacco devices should not be shown in stores for selling or advertising. This means no store can display heated tobacco devices.</p>
            <p>Ms. Luo Su-Ying, the leader of the Tobacco Control Division at the Ministry of Health and Welfare's National Health Agency, said that heated tobacco is a tobacco product. Services to help people quit smoking include quitting all tobacco. Products with extra ingredients that the government later bans must follow the rules. It is also not allowed to say that using heated tobacco is harmless or less harmful, even if it has passed Taiwan's health check.</p>
            <p>About whether heated tobacco will be sold in all places that sell regular cigarettes, Ms. Luo Su-Ying said that during the approval process, companies promised to manage where they sell the products. This was part of the conditions for approval. How they actually sell the products depends on the heated tobacco companies. But no matter how many places they open to sell them, companies must follow the approved conditions and the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act.</p>

            <h1>ASE Technology Expects More Chip Business in Late 2025, Advanced Tech to Help Sales Next Year</h1>
            <p>Mr. Wu Tien-Yu, who is the chief operating officer for ASE Technology Holding, thinks that the company's business for packaging and testing computer chips will keep growing in the third and fourth quarters. He also said that advanced ways of packaging and testing chips will add 1 billion US dollars to their sales this year compared to 2024. The company's sales will continue to grow until 2026 and even after that.</p>
            <p>ASE Technology Holding held a meeting with investors this afternoon. Mr. Wu Tien-Yu talked about how the company will do in the second half of the year. He thinks that if we look at the money in US dollars, the chip packaging and testing business will keep growing from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>For special advanced chip packaging and testing, Mr. Wu Tien-Yu expects that annual sales will go up by 1 billion US dollars compared to 2024. This will make the packaging and testing business grow by 10%. The general business will grow by about 5% to 9% this year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Tien-Yu believes that ASE Technology Holding's sales will continue to increase until 2026 and even longer. This is because of new advanced solutions, the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the whole market for computer chips getting better.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Tien-Yu said that the company will continue to put money into research, training people, making more advanced chips, and building smart factories. This will help the company grow for many years.</p>

            <h1>Alishan Highway and Provincial Highway 3 (Zhongpu to Dapu) to Close Tonight for Safety</h1>
            <p>Due to strong winds from the southwest, the mountain areas in Chiayi County are getting a lot of heavy rain. This rain might cause landslides, rocks to fall, and trees to fall down, which can be dangerous. To keep people and cars safe, the Highway Bureau will close parts of the Alishan Highway and Provincial Highway 3, from Zhongpu to Dapu, tonight as a safety measure.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau's office for Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan areas announced that a part of Alishan Highway (Road 18) from Fushan to Alishan (from kilometer 68.5 to kilometer 88) will close tonight at 6 PM. Another part of Road 18, from Chukou to Fushan (from kilometer 34 to kilometer 68.5), will close tonight at 8 PM.</p>
            <p>Also, starting tonight at 8 PM, Provincial Highway 3, from Zhongpu Yunshui to Dapu in Chiayi County (from kilometer 295 to kilometer 336), will also be closed as a safety measure.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau stated that these roads will open again tomorrow morning at 8 AM, but this depends on the weather and how the roads look. They want to tell drivers that during typhoons and heavy rain, mountain roads can have landslides and falling rocks easily. It is hard to know what the road conditions will be like. So, if you do not have to, please do not go on mountain roads.</p>
