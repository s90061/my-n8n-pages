            <h1>Union Says St. John's University Is Firing Teachers Under the Guise of Relocation, But the University Says It Follows the Law.</h1>
            <p>Teachers from St. John's University and the Higher Education Union went to the Ministry of Education today. They said that the university is pretending to move six full-time teachers to new roles, but they are actually trying to fire them. St. John's University, however, stated that they are helping teachers find new positions according to the law, and they are not firing anyone illegally.</p>
            <p>Cai Lihui, who is the head of the St. John's University Teachers' Association, said that they are speaking up not only for themselves but also for all private school teachers. According to Article 27 of the Teachers' Act, teachers can only be fired if there are no classes for them to teach and no other jobs they can do. If teachers have classes to teach, they should not be forced to leave their jobs.</p>
            <p>Cai Lihui also mentioned that in recent years, St. John's University has had more and more international students. Also, the number of students accepted into new special classes is said to be among the top three in the country. She doesn't understand why the university is doing the opposite by firing full-time teachers.</p>
            <p>Lin Baiyi, who is a director at the Higher Education Union, questioned if St. John's University is creating a false idea that some teachers have no classes to teach. He thinks they might be doing this by controlling the class schedule system and using other administrative methods. He also believes they might be tricking full-time teachers into working at the Chinese language center on one-year contracts, which would harm their rights.</p>
            <p>One teacher who was affected said that what the school calls "helping teachers find new roles" is just for show. In reality, if teachers don't want to give up their full-time status, they are not even given interviews for administrative jobs. This makes the "help" seem like a failure, and then the process of firing them starts right away.</p>
            <p>In response, St. John's University released a statement. They said that all their steps follow the law. They went through the placement process four times. Only when teachers clearly said they did not accept the new roles, did the university start the process of firing them, as the law allows. The university added that this process is still ongoing, and no teacher has been fired yet.</p>
            <p>St. John's University explained that the falling birth rate has caused serious problems. Some departments have not accepted new students for years or have no students enrolled. Starting from the 2025-2026 school year, they will face the reality of having even fewer students and no classes to offer. However, they are still trying their best to protect teachers' rights. Some teachers have not taught enough hours for many years, but the university still pays them according to their contracts. The university said, "We have not asked for the money back or punished them. We have always handled this with good intentions."</p>
            <p>The university also stressed that St. John's University is the first university in Taiwan to sign a group agreement with a union. This shows their honesty and willingness to work together. The university strongly protests against false accusations, twisted conversations, and attacks on specific people from outside. They also said they will use their legal rights to deal with these issues.</p>

            <h1>Patient Groups Ask for Easier Rules for Crohn's Disease Drugs; Health Ministry Says It Will Consider It.</h1>
            <p>Crohn's disease and other bowel diseases that cause inflammation often affect young and middle-aged adults. A patient suggested on an online platform for public policy that health insurance rules for these drugs should be relaxed. More than 5,000 people supported this idea. Today, the Minister of Health and Welfare, Chiu Tai-yuan, promised to study the matter quickly to help more patients.</p>
            <p>The person who made the suggestion said that the National Health Insurance Administration should change the rules for giving out medicine to people with inflammatory bowel diseases, like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. They want to remove the current one-year limit. Instead, they suggest using standards like those for other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, which allow for more than two years of treatment. They also want to encourage different medical departments to work together to improve care and the quality of life for patients.</p>
            <p>Starting from July 11, the person who made the suggestion collected information from patients and medical staff using an online survey. So far, 129 people have answered, and 75 of them are patients. The information shows that 84% of patients had stomach pain and blood in their stool again after stopping their medicine. 76% felt sad or worried. 64% said it affected their studies and work. 80.6% of patients hoped to continue their treatment for longer. 61.2% hoped that the rule requiring them to wait three months after stopping medicine before applying again would be removed.</p>
            <p>Today, the number of people supporting the suggestion on the public policy online platform reached the goal. The Taiwan Association for Gut Health and the Taiwan Bowel Health Association together released a press release. They said that inflammatory bowel diseases are common in young and middle-aged adults. These diseases happen when the body's own defense system attacks the intestines. This causes severe stomach pain and blood in the stool. Patients often spend a lot of time in the bathroom when they are awake. The disease can also cause the intestines to become narrow, have holes, get blocked, or even burst.</p>
            <p>The press release stated that currently, it is hard to get health insurance coverage for these drugs. After using the medicine for one year, patients are forced to stop. Patients often have to stop treatment just when it starts to work. If they need to ask for the medicine again, they have to wait for their symptoms to come back and then wait for a three-month observation period. Some patients even wait for almost half a year. This makes patients, who could otherwise work steadily, fall into a bad cycle of getting sick again and again. It causes a lot of stress for their minds and bodies and wastes health insurance money.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Chiu Tai-yuan attended the Ministry of Health and Welfare's anniversary event. He gave awards for health and welfare professionals and recognized excellent public servants. Before the event, he spoke to the media. He was asked when the proposal to relax the rules for inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease would be discussed by experts, now that enough people have supported it. He said that they will study it as soon as possible so that more patients can receive better care.</p>

            <h1>KMT Says Recall Group Member Makes Money in China; Group Responds That People Are Free to Do Business Abroad.</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporters Chang Chi and Huang Li-yun, Hualien County, July 23) Today, the Kuomintang (KMT) group in Hualien County Council said that Xiao Ling (Liu Yu-wen), who speaks for the recall group "Remove the Black Core," has a background in doing business in China. "Remove the Black Core" responded with a statement saying that people naturally have the freedom to do legal business with other countries.</p>
            <p>The KMT group in Hualien County Council held a press conference today. Wu Chien-chih, the group's spokesperson, said that Liu Yu-wen claims to be against communism and says she fights for Taiwan's democracy. However, she actually registered and runs "Wendao Culture Communication Co., Ltd." in Dongguan, China. She also worked in Beijing and took part in theater tours in China, and Chinese media even reported on her. Wu Chien-chih said, "Fighting against China to protect Taiwan is false; making money from China is true."</p>
            <p>Wu Chien-chih questioned if it is ironic that Liu Yu-wen has changed to become a "democratic fighter" in Taiwan's political struggles. He said her two-faced actions are just like the "Green Communist logic" of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its supporters.</p>
            <p>Wu Chien-chih said that these people criticize China in Taiwan while making money in China. But they then shamelessly criticize KMT representatives and start recall campaigns. He believes they are no longer fighting for democracy. Instead, their goal is to completely defeat the KMT, control all power, and create a one-party rule.</p>
            <p>"Remove the Black Core" released a statement today. They said that people naturally have the freedom to do legal business with other countries. This is the spirit of free trade. However, they pointed out that KMT lawmakers are important national figures who often deal with secret information. They frequently contact Chinese United Front organizations. The danger this might cause to national security is much higher than that of normal people doing business with China.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that based on the experiences of people from various industries who have dealt with China, the group deeply understands that Taiwan's freedom and democracy were not easily gained.</p>
            <p>"Remove the Black Core" stated that KMT lawmakers are working with China's United Front Department. They continuously attack and bother Taiwanese citizens, repeatedly share people's private information on purpose, and use their power as the majority to forcefully pass laws that go against the constitution and cause chaos. They want to destroy Taiwan's democracy. This is why the group started the recall campaign: to remove unsuitable lawmakers who are not loyal.</p>
