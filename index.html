        const text = `**AI Will Reshape the Economy, Report Says**

A new report suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) will significantly change the world's economy and how we work by 2030. Experts believe AI will make businesses much more productive. This means companies can produce more goods and services with the same resources, or even fewer.

The report also predicts that AI will transform jobs. While some jobs might change or even disappear, many new ones will be created. These new roles will often involve working with AI technologies. Therefore, it is important for workers to learn new skills related to AI. Businesses also need to invest in AI technology and train their employees.

This shift could lead to big economic growth for many countries. However, the report warns that governments and companies must plan carefully for these changes. They need to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared broadly and that people are prepared for the future of work.

**Venice Introduces New Fee for Day Visitors**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, has started charging a fee for day-trippers. This new rule began at the end of April and requires visitors who do not stay overnight in the city to pay â‚¬5 to enter certain areas. The aim is to manage the large number of tourists who visit Venice every day.

Venice is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and its delicate structure is easily damaged by over-tourism. City officials hope the fee will reduce overcrowding, especially during busy times. Residents have often complained about the negative effects of too many tourists, such as rising prices and crowded public transport.

The trial period for the fee will last for several days during peak season, mostly on weekends and public holidays. There are some exceptions, for example, for residents of Venice and visitors who have booked accommodation. While the fee aims to protect the city, it has received mixed reactions from both tourists and locals.

**Four-Day Work Week Gains Popularity Globally**

The idea of a four-day work week is becoming more popular around the world. Instead of working five days, employees work four days, usually for the same pay. This typically means working 32 hours instead of 40. Companies and governments in various countries are experimenting with this model.

Studies from trials in places like the UK, Iceland, and the United States show many benefits. Employees often report better work-life balance, less stress, and improved mental health. For businesses, some trials have shown increased productivity and lower staff turnover. This is because happy and well-rested employees tend to work more efficiently.

However, a four-day week is not suitable for every industry, especially those that require constant service or have complex schedules. Despite these challenges, the success of many pilot programs suggests that this new way of working could become more common in the future, changing daily life for many people.`;
