A new study shows that even though smartphones connect us to a lot of information, they don't always help us feel more connected to other people. Many adults in the U.S. now own smartphones, and they spend a lot of time using them. While these devices are great for getting news, checking weather, or finding directions, some people feel that smartphones make them less connected to their friends and family in real life. The study found that a significant number of smartphone users believe their phone has made them feel more connected to information and entertainment, but not necessarily to people. This suggests that while technology offers many benefits, it's also changing the way we interact with each other and the world around us.

**Hybrid Work: Employees Not Going to the Office Enough, Companies Say**

A recent report shows that many employees working in a hybrid way — partly from home, partly from the office — are not coming into the office as often as their companies want. After the pandemic, many businesses allowed employees to work remotely, but now more companies are asking staff to return to the office for at least a few days a week. However, a new survey found that a majority of hybrid workers are not meeting these expectations. This creates a challenge for companies trying to balance the benefits of in-person collaboration with the flexibility that employees now expect. Some companies are looking for ways to encourage more office attendance, while employees value the freedom that hybrid work offers.

**Venice Starts New Fee for Day-Trippers to Manage Tourism**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, has started a new system to help control the large number of tourists visiting each day. From now on, visitors who come for just one day must pay a €5 fee. This trial program aims to reduce "overtourism," a problem where too many tourists cause damage to the city, stress for residents, and a less enjoyable experience for everyone. Venice is one of the world's most popular destinations, but its small size and fragile environment make it especially vulnerable to large crowds. The new fee is meant to encourage tourists to visit during less busy times or to stay longer, helping to spread out the impact of tourism and protect the city's unique charm.
