AI chatbots and apps are becoming more common tools for people, especially young people, to get mental health support. These digital helpers can be found in apps on phones and online, offering advice and help whenever needed.

One big advantage of using AI for mental health is that it's easy to access and people can remain private. Some users feel more comfortable talking to an AI than a human, especially about difficult feelings. These chatbots can provide quick responses and helpful tips for managing stress or anxiety.

However, experts also have some worries. They are concerned about how well these apps protect personal information. There are also questions about whether AI can truly understand human emotions as deeply as a person can. While AI can offer a good first step for support, most experts agree it cannot completely replace real human therapists. For serious mental health issues, talking to a trained professional is still the best option.

**More Companies Trying Four-Day Work Week**

The idea of working only four days a week is becoming more popular around the world. Many companies are now testing this new work schedule to see if it benefits their employees and business.

Recent studies, especially in the UK, have shown positive results. Companies that switched to a four-day week often found that their employees were happier and less stressed. Staff reported a better balance between their work and personal lives. Surprisingly, many businesses also saw that their employees became more productive, meaning they got more work done in less time. Some companies even reported higher profits.

However, moving to a four-day week can also bring challenges. For some jobs, like in healthcare or customer service, it might be harder to organize. Companies need to make sure that the work still gets done effectively. Despite these challenges, the four-day work week seems to be a growing trend, as more businesses look for ways to improve their employees' well-being and keep them motivated.

**Popular European Cities Battling Too Many Tourists**

Many famous cities and areas in Europe are now facing a big problem: too many tourists. Places like Amsterdam, Venice, and Santorini are so popular that large numbers of visitors are affecting the lives of local people and sometimes even damaging the environment. This problem is often called "overtourism."

To deal with this, different places are trying various solutions. For example, some cities are increasing the taxes that tourists have to pay. Others are limiting the number of large cruise ships that can visit, or making it necessary for tourists to book their entry to certain famous areas in advance. The goal is to control the number of visitors and encourage them to explore less-known parts of the country.

These measures aim to find a balance. They want to make sure that tourism still brings money to the local economy, but also that residents can live comfortably and that the beautiful places are kept safe for the future. Many popular destinations are now focusing on more sustainable tourism.
