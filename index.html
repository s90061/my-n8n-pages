**Sinner Wins Wimbledon, Defeating Alcaraz in Revenge Match**

Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner won his first Wimbledon title by beating Spain's Carlos Alcaraz. This victory was a sweet revenge for Sinner, as Alcaraz had defeated him in the French Open final just last month. Sinner is the first Italian male player to win the Wimbledon championship. He now has four major titles, while Alcaraz has five. These two young players are now at the top of men's tennis. Their match was very exciting because they had a long, tough match in the French Open final. Sinner lost the first set but then played very calmly and won the next three sets, all by 6-4. After the match, Sinner said he was "living his dream" and that he learned from his loss in Paris. This Wimbledon final was important because it was the first time since 2008 that the world's top two male players met in both the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same year. Sinner's win ended Alcaraz's streak of five Grand Slam final wins and his 24-match winning streak. Alcaraz now leads their career matches 8-5, but Sinner ended his five-match losing streak against him. Alcaraz congratulated Sinner on his well-deserved win. The matches between Sinner and Alcaraz are now one of the most interesting parts of tennis, after the famous "Big Three" era of Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic.

**Former Nigerian President Buhari Dies at 82 in London**

Muhammadu Buhari, the former president of Nigeria, passed away at the age of 82 in London on July 13th. Buhari was a strong military ruler in the 1980s. Later, he changed his image and became a democratic leader. He served two terms as elected president from 2015 to 2023. His spokesperson confirmed that he died in a clinic in London. Nigeria's current president, Bola Tinubu, has called Buhari's wife and sent his vice president, Kashim Shettima, to bring Buhari's body back to Nigeria. Buhari, who was from northern Nigeria, made history in 2015. He was the first opposition candidate to win an election against a sitting president in Nigeria. At that time, many people thought his win would be a big change for the country. However, during his time as president, he was not able to solve Nigeria's old problems of corruption and insecurity. Also, the country's economy became worse while he was in office.
