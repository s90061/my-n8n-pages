        const text = `**Gansu Kindergarten Lead Poisoning Case: Provincial Investigation Launched**

Officials in Gansu, China, have started a higher-level investigation into a lead poisoning case at a kindergarten in Tianshui city. This comes after public criticism that local officials called it "abnormal blood lead levels" instead of "lead poisoning."

Parents discovered the severe lead poisoning after taking their children to a hospital in Xi'an because they did not trust the local test results. The Tianshui government had said earlier that kitchen staff used non-edible paint in some food.

The new provincial investigation team will include top officials and experts from national health and environment ministries. The results will be made public. This area has had lead poisoning incidents before, including one in 2006.
