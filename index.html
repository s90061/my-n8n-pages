            <h1>Lin Yun-ju Beats Lee Sang-su of Korea, Moves to Last 32 at WTT Swedish Grand Slam</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese male table tennis player Lin Yun-ju won his first match today in the WTT Swedish Grand Slam. He played against 35-year-old Lee Sang-su from South Korea in the round of 64. Lin won with scores of 16-14, 11-7, and 11-8. This win was a revenge for his previous loss against Lee, and Lin has now moved on to the round of 32.</p>
            <p>Lin Yun-ju just turned 24. He is currently ranked 11th in the men's singles for the World Table Tennis (WTT) league. Before this match, he had played against Lee Sang-su, who is ranked 22nd, two times. Both players had won one match each. Their last game was in April this year at the Incheon Champions tournament semifinals, where Lin Yun-ju lost 2-4.</p>
            <p>In today's match, Lin Yun-ju faced strong resistance from Lee in the first game. Towards the end of the game, Lin was leading 9-6, but Lee scored 4 points in a row and took the lead by one point. After that, they were tied five times. Lin won the first game with two strong attacks. This game lasted almost 20 minutes.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Lin Yun-ju started to take control. When the score was 4-4, he used his famous backhand flick to score points and won the game 11-7.</p>
            <p>In the third game, Lin Yun-ju kept a small lead of one or two points at the start. But in the middle of the game, he was behind 5-6. Then, Lin scored four points in a row, which broke Lee Sang-su's spirit. Lin then won the match in three straight games.</p>
            <p>Lin Yun-ju will now play against Japan's Hayate Togami in the round of 32. Lin has played against Togami twice before and won both times.</p>
            <p>Also, Feng Yi-hsin, who played well and won a gold medal with the men's team at the Universiade in Germany this year, played his first match today with an injury. He lost to Slovenia's Darko Jorgic with scores of 11-9, 9-11, 6-11, and 13-15.</p>

            <h1>Gang Violence Gets Worse in Ecuador; 7 People Shot Dead in Pool Hall</h1>
            <p>Bogota, August 17 (AFP) â€“ Gang violence in Ecuador has led to another terrible killing. Police said today that several gunmen went into a pool hall in Santo Domingo city and shot at least 7 people dead.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the National Police of Ecuador told reporters on WhatsApp that a shooting happened in a pool hall in the nightlife area of Santo Domingo. "Seven people died from gunshots." Santo Domingo is about 150 kilometers (93 miles) from the capital city, Quito.</p>
            <p>Police said they are looking into the event and trying to find the people who did it.</p>
            <p>Videos on the internet, which are said to be from the shooting, show several gunmen wearing black masks shooting two men at the entrance of the pool hall. People walking nearby ran away in fear.</p>
            <p>The gunmen then went inside the pool hall and kept shooting. They ran away before police cars arrived.</p>
            <p>AFP has not confirmed if the video is real.</p>
            <p>Local media reported that early investigations show the shooting might be connected to organized crime in the area.</p>
            <p>Last month, a similar mass shooting happened in a pool hall in Playas, a tourist city in the southwest, where at least 9 people died. Also, in April this year, a group of armed criminals killed 12 people at a cockfighting arena about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from Santo Domingo.</p>
            <p>Ecuador used to be seen as a peaceful place in Latin America. But for many years, international drug groups have grown and used Ecuador's ports to send drugs to the United States and Europe. This has caused a crisis in the country.</p>
            <p>The number of drug groups in Ecuador has increased a lot. The murder rate in the country went from 6 murders per 100,000 people in 2018 to 38 murders per 100,000 people in 2024.</p>
