            <h1>Meinong "Grand Canyon" Illegal Mining Case: Chen Chi-mai Says City Will Sweep Widely Across Departments</h1>
            <p>Farmland in Kaohsiung City's Meinong District has been illegally mined for soil and rocks, and waste has been dumped there. Mayor Chen Chi-mai said today that all cases will be strictly investigated and handled according to law. The city will take responsibility and work hard to stop these crimes. They will do this by having different government departments work together to search and clear out the area on a large scale.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Information Bureau released a statement. It said that Chen Chi-mai seriously stated in a city meeting today that the city will not avoid these problems. They will take responsibility and do their best to stop these crimes and bring the bad people to justice.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai told the departments to strictly follow the law. All cases must be investigated and handled seriously by law. The process of catching criminals should be simpler and bigger. Different departments will work together to conduct a large-scale clean-up. If they find any illegal acts, they will punish them very strictly and tell the prosecutors right away.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai also said that during the investigation, they found some cases where landowners bought land, then quickly sold it to others who then started illegal mining and dumping waste. He thinks that the current law for mining soil and rocks mainly gives fines, which is not strong enough to stop these crimes.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai also asked the central government to change the law. He wants to add criminal penalties and also look at the Waste Disposal Act and the Regional Plan Act. This would make punishments stronger and stop more crimes.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai said that these new types of crimes involve many people working together. The city government will ask different departments to continue large-scale clean-ups. This will completely break up these illegal groups. It will show that the city government is very serious and determined to stop illegal acts.</p>

            <h1>No Right to Run for Party Leader? Fu Kun-chi: I Haven't Even Thought About Running Yet</h1>
            <p>There are rumors that Fu Kun-chi, who leads the KMT party in the Legislative Yuan, wants to run for party chairman. This has caused discussions within the party about whether he is allowed to run. Today, Fu Kun-chi said that people care if he can run, but for him, it's not important because he hasn't even thought about running yet. He thanked everyone for their care and encouragement.</p>
            <p>It is rumored that Fu Kun-chi wants to run for KMT chairman, but there's a debate inside the party about whether he is qualified. News reports say that Fu Kun-chi was kicked out of the KMT party in the past. This was because he ran for Hualien County Magistrate against party rules. So, he might not meet the rules in the "Party Chairman Election Regulations" and cannot run. However, some party members say that the changes to the election rules came later. So, by law, the new rules should not apply to things that happened before.</p>
            <p>Today, Fu Kun-chi spoke to reporters at the Legislative Yuan. He said that working in the Legislative Yuan is already very busy, and he will think about it carefully in the next few days. He added that people are wondering if he is qualified to run. He thinks this is not important because he has not decided to run yet. He thanked everyone for their interest and support.</p>
            <p>Fu Kun-chi also pointed out that it is good that people are willing to take on this responsibility. He said the KMT party is in a very difficult situation, like an empty house. He believes that KMT Chairman Chu Li-luan has spent all his savings. He wishes good luck to anyone who takes on the role. He hopes the KMT chairman election will be a healthy competition. Only by working together can they face the strong Democratic Progressive Party.</p>
            <p>Fu Kun-chi did not clearly say if he would run for party chairman. He only said, "Let the bullets fly." He mentioned that many good party members have come forward. These include Lo Chih-chiang, an excellent KMT party secretary, Hao Lung-pin, a former Taipei Mayor with full experience, and Chang Ya-chung, the head of Sun Wen School, who has great ideas about Sun Yat-sen's thoughts. He said, "As long as it succeeds, success doesn't have to be because of me."</p>
