Prices in UK shops went up at the slowest rate since December 2021 last month. This news brings some good feelings to families, as the economy is expected to grow more.

Shop prices were 1.3% higher in March compared to a year before. This is a big drop from February's 2.5% increase. This information comes from a group called the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and NielsenIQ.

Food prices, for example, rose by 3.7% in March. This is less than the 5.0% rise in February and the lowest rate since May 2022. Prices for things other than food actually went down by 0.2%, which is the first time this has happened since July 2022.

Helen Dickinson, who leads the BRC, said that shops have been taking on their own rising costs. This has helped them to make prices go up more slowly for customers. However, she warned that soon, workers will earn a higher minimum wage and business taxes might increase. These changes could make it difficult for shops to keep prices low in the future.

**Return to Office Slowing, But Some Leaders Still Want It**

The trend of people going back to the office is slowing down. Big companies like Disney and Goldman Sachs are not pushing their employees to return as much as before, according to new information.

In the ten largest cities in the United States, about half of the office desks are used on average. This number has stayed about the same for several months, which means that the mix of working from home and in the office is becoming more stable.

However, many company leaders still want their staff to work in the office full-time. A study by KPMG found that 64% of these leaders believe their employees will be back in the office completely within the next three years.

This creates a difference between what employees want, which is to be flexible and work from home sometimes, and what some leaders think is best for their company. These leaders believe that working together in person helps with company culture and getting work done.

Companies are trying different ways to solve this. Some ask employees to come in only a few days a week, while others offer rewards for being in the office. They are still trying to find the best way to balance working from home and working in the office.

**Travel Costs Up, But More People Still Want to Travel This Summer**

People in America are very excited about planning their summer holidays. This is true even though costs for travel have gone up because of rising prices for everything. Travel experts say that people still want to go on trips.

Even though plane tickets and hotel rooms cost more, many people still want to travel, especially to popular places and for special experiences.

Travelers are changing how they plan their trips. They are booking earlier, being more flexible with their travel dates, or choosing places closer to home to save money.

Experts suggest several ways to make summer travel cheaper. You can use points from loyalty programs, look for good deals during less busy times of the year, and decide on a clear budget before you start planning.

Overall, the future for summer travel looks good. Many people are choosing to spend their money on experiences like holidays rather than on new things for their homes.
