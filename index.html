(Central News Agency reporter He Xiuling, Taipei, July 15) On July 14, a fire broke out at the San-Yuan Energy factory in Siaogang, which is a part of TCCâ€™s energy technology subsidiary. TCC Chairman Chang An-ping stopped his work trip overseas and came back to Taiwan, rushing to the site. He said that the cause of the fire will be fully investigated, and those responsible will be strictly held accountable. This is to make sure that the companyâ€™s operations continue and orders are stable for its global high-tech industry clients.

Also, TCC announced today that the San-Yuan Energy battery factory has completely stopped operations. It is not yet clear if the company will be fined. The financial and business effects are still being calculated.

A TCC press release stated that after Chang An-ping arrived at the factory today and listened to reports from senior managers, he learned that the factory had not communicated well with the local community. He asked senior managers from the operations department to work directly with senior managers from San-Yuan Energy. They will form a special group to rebuild the community relations unit. This unit will make sure that communication with nearby residents is open and that the communityâ€™s concerns are addressed.

Chang An-ping pointed out that the San-Yuan factory uses many automatic sensors in the formation area where the fire started. There are more than 332,800 temperature sensors and 17,400 smoke sensors, along with a multi-stage emergency response plan. However, he noted that the system clearly did not work as expected in this event.

Chang An-ping emphasized that a special investigation team has been formed. The most important thing now is to cool down the area, then go back into the factory to find computers and monitoring equipment to check all data. They will review all records of related equipment operation and design settings. They need to find out why the systemâ€™s response was different from what happened on site. They will fully investigate if it was a management problem, a human error, or if the equipment itself had problems.

Chang An-ping said that internally, there will be a very strict review of responsibility. If there are any mistakes in management or if staff are responsible, action will be taken according to company rules. Externally, they will also hold responsible the manufacturers who provided the equipment. Especially, the company that supplied the process equipment to the San-Yuan factory is a world-famous company. They should have a lot of experience in battery production equipment. They will deeply investigate if their equipment had any defects or design problems. Legal action will be taken immediately to make them pay for damages and make necessary improvements.

Chang An-ping noted that the companyâ€™s battery cell brand, Molicel, is the only international top-tier brand in Taiwanâ€™s important battery supply chain. International customers have many orders for Molicelâ€™s high-end batteries. This event could greatly affect the global high-tech industry. He hopes to reduce the impact on customersâ€™ order delivery as much as possible. San-Yuan Energy Technologyâ€™s parent company, E-Moli Energy, has started checking and moving production capacity at its Southern Taiwan Science Park factory to maximize production and support the affected orders.

***Starbucks North America Requires Employees to Come to the Office 4 Days a Week; Those Who Disagree Can Leave***

(Central News Agency, Seattle, July 14, foreign wire report) Today, the American coffee company Starbucks asked some of its managers who work from home to return to the office. Also, company employees now need to work in the office 4 days a week, instead of the earlier rule of 3 days.

The Associated Press reported that Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol sent a message to employees saying that starting in early October, employees must work in the office 4 days a week, not 3 days as before.

Starbucks, which has its main office in Seattle, said that "people managers" in its company must move back to the Seattle main office or the Toronto office within 12 months. In February this year, the company only asked managers at the vice president level and higher to work in Seattle or Toronto.

Starbucks said that the employees who report to these managers will not be asked to move to the office. But for all future job openings and transfers, employees will need to work in Seattle or Toronto.

Niccol wrote in his message: "We are building our office culture again because working together brings the best results. We will share ideas more effectively, use creativity to solve problems, and act faster."

Niccol said that if affected employees do not want to move, they can choose a "voluntary departure plan" and receive severance pay.

Many employees got used to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, over the past year, more and more companies have asked employees to return to the office. Big employers like Amazon, AT&T, and the U.S. federal government have already asked employees to work in the office 5 days a week. Jobs that allow full-time remote work are very popular.

Starbucks spokesperson Lori Torgerson said she could not say how many employees are currently "people managers" or are allowed to work from home. Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, including coffee roasters and warehouse workers. (Translator: Lin Yifeng/Proofreader: Shi Shi) 1140715
