            <h1>German Companies in China Expect Lowest Salary Increases Ever</h1>
            <p>A new report from the German Chamber of Commerce in China shows that German companies there are giving smaller salary increases. Also, they expect next year's salary increases to be the lowest ever. However, fewer companies plan to cut jobs this year, and the number of foreign workers stays about the same.</p>
            <p>The German Chamber of Commerce in China published its 18th "Labor Market and Salary Report" on July 17th. This report used information collected online from 475 German companies in China. The information was gathered between April 17th and May 31st this year.</p>
            <p>The survey found that actual salary increases were less than expected. On average, German companies in China gave a 3.24% pay raise this year. This was 0.57 percentage points lower than what they expected. For example, in the car industry, companies thought salaries would go up by 3.94%, but they only went up by 2.82%. This is the third year in a row that actual salary increases have been less than expected.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, the expected salary increases for next year are the lowest ever. German companies in China think salaries will go up by 3.19% next year. This is 0.62 percentage points less than the 3.81% they expected for this year. This shows that salary growth has been slowing down since 2019.</p>
            <p>For new employees, the survey showed that salary changes were small last year. 72% of companies gave new hires the same or very similar salaries as their last job. Also, 44% of companies gave pay raises of less than 5% to employees who got a promotion.</p>
            <p>However, the report expects fewer job cuts this year. Last year, 29% of companies cut jobs. This year, that number went down to 21%. Also, 24% of companies plan to hire more staff this year, which is 10 percentage points more than last year.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the number of foreign employees is stable. About 65.1% of German companies in China hire foreign workers. This is a small increase from 65.0% last year. The main reasons for hiring local Chinese employees instead of foreign ones are salary (67.1%), job stability (35.2%), and business connections (28.3%).</p>
            <p>Clas Neumann, who is the chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce for East and Central China, said that German companies are focusing on important things. He said that job cuts have become steady, and companies are investing more in developing their workers. He also mentioned that foreign experts are still very important, especially for smaller and medium-sized companies.</p>
            <p>He added that the small expected increase in salaries shows that companies are being realistic about the market. It also shows that the job market is stable. The 18th "Labor Market and Salary Report" gives full information about salary changes in China. It also talks about the latest trends and important topics in China's job market.</p>

            <h1>Fu Kun-chi Plans Disaster Relief Law for South; Hualien Green Camp Says He's Saving His Job</h1>
            <p>Today, July 19th, Kuomintang legislator Fu Kun-chi announced something important. He said that if the central government does not help enough with the typhoon damage in southern Taiwan, he will work with the Taiwan People's Party. Together, they will suggest a special law for emergency disaster relief in Tainan and Chiayi. However, Green camp politicians in Hualien criticized him. They said that Mr. Fu is not worried about the heavy rain and preventing disasters. Instead, he is too busy trying to save his own political position from a vote to remove him from office.</p>
            <p>Today, the Kuomintang Hualien County office held two events to support Mr. Fu Kun-chi. These events were called "Against Recall, Protect Democracy." Han Kuo-yu, the head of the Legislative Yuan, came to Hualien today. He joined Mr. Fu and they drove through Hualien City and Ji'an Township in the rain, waving to people. After that, they went to Ji'an Junior High School for the first event against the recall. The second event was held at 3 PM in Yuli Township Art Center.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that Hualien is like his second home. He used to be a soldier and a teacher there, so he feels a lot for Hualien. He even voted for the first time in his life after going back north from the army camp in Hualien. He still remembers the "Song of Hualien" that he learned 45 years ago, and he sang it with the people there.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that he is always happy when he comes to Hualien. But this time, he felt it was strange. He came to help with the election only a year ago, but now he is here to fight against a recall vote. He said that the Democratic Progressive Party is using government money to try to remove 31 Kuomintang legislators. He believes this is not democracy; it is a "political massacre" against the party that is in opposition. He asked everyone to stand together and vote "no" to the recall, to protect Taiwan's democracy.</p>
            <p>Fu Kun-chi spoke at the event. He said that Tainan and Chiayi were badly damaged by the typhoon, and the government has not been able to help enough so far. He asked the Executive Yuan to quickly propose a special law for emergency disaster relief in Tainan and Chiayi. If the Executive Yuan does not want to do it, the Kuomintang will ask the Taiwan People's Party to work with them. This is to help the people whose roofs were blown off and who cannot live in their homes, so they can get back to normal life quickly.</p>
            <p>However, Hualien County Councilor Chang Mei-hui from the Democratic Progressive Party and other local Green camp politicians criticized Mr. Fu. They said that Mr. Fu is the only legislator from Hualien. He is not worried about the heavy rain. Local rescue workers are busy helping in the disaster, but Mr. Fu is busy bringing many people to Hualien to help him save his political position.</p>
            <p>When asked by reporters after the event about the Hualien Green camp's criticism that he was not helping with the disaster but focusing on the recall, Fu Kun-chi replied. He said he believes that the Hualien County Government and the disaster prevention center are ready. He said that a legislator should let people know their rights. That is why he arranged public talks in different places. He said that everyone has their own job, and the Democratic Progressive Party should not twist his words too much.</p>
