Studies show that regular exercise is very good for your mental health. It doesn't just make your body stronger; it also helps your brain handle stress better. When you exercise, your brain can grow new cells and make existing connections stronger, especially in areas important for memory and emotions.

Doctors explain that physical activity changes your brain's chemistry. It can reduce levels of stress hormones like cortisol. At the same time, it increases chemicals that make you feel good, such as endorphins. This helps to improve your mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression.

Even small amounts of exercise, like a 20-minute walk, can make a difference. Over time, being active regularly can make your brain more resistant to stress. This means you might find it easier to stay calm and think clearly when faced with difficult situations. So, moving your body is a powerful way to protect your mind.

**AI Will Change Many Jobs, Says IMF**

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently said that artificial intelligence (AI) will affect a large number of jobs in developed countries. They believe that about 60% of jobs in these countries could be changed by AI. For half of these jobs, AI might help people by making their work easier and more productive. This means workers could see their incomes rise because they become more efficient.

However, for the other half of these jobs, AI could take over tasks currently done by people. This might lead to some jobs disappearing, or people needing to learn new skills to adapt. The report suggests that countries need to prepare for these changes by offering training and support to workers.

The IMF's head, Kristalina Georgieva, said that AI could be like a "tsunami" for the job market. It presents both big opportunities and big challenges. Governments and businesses will need to work together to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared widely and that people are helped through the changes.

**Venice Now Charges a Fee for Day-Trippers**

The Italian city of Venice has started a new rule for tourists visiting for just one day. From April 25th, people who visit Venice but don't stay overnight will have to pay a 5-euro entry fee. This new rule is part of the city's efforts to manage the large number of tourists it receives, especially during busy times.

The fee applies to visitors over the age of 14 during peak hours, usually between 8 AM and 4 PM. Visitors can book their tickets online before they arrive. People who are staying in hotels in Venice or who are residents do not need to pay this fee.

City officials hope this measure will help reduce overcrowding and make the city more enjoyable for both tourists and locals. Venice is one of the world's most popular travel destinations, and its unique structure makes it particularly sensitive to too many visitors. This fee is a trial for now, and the city will review its effects in the future.
