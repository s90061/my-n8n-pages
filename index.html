            <h1>Brazil faces high US tariffs, looks to China for new export chances</h1>
            <p>The United States is charging high taxes, up to 50%, on some products from Brazil. Because of this, Brazil's government and businesses are actively looking to China to sell their goods. China is very willing to work more closely with Brazil, especially in food, energy, and raw materials for industry.</p>
            <p>According to CNN Brazil, Thomas Law, who leads the "China-Brazil Sociocultural Research Center" (Ibrachina), said that China wants to have many different suppliers. They are looking for countries that have stable and good relationships. This makes Brazil an important partner. China has started buying products from Brazil that it used to buy from the United States. This shows a change in where China buys its goods.</p>
            <p>Brazil mostly sells farm products and raw materials to China. But to the United States, Brazil sells industrial products that are worth more. Mr. Law thinks it will still be hard for Brazil to sell its industrial products to China. However, Brazil and China are talking more often, which shows there might be new chances.</p>
            <p>Recently, China allowed 183 Brazilian companies to sell coffee to China. China also added more companies that can import sesame and animal powders from Brazil. These actions show that China is opening its market to Brazil, and they give real chances for Brazilian companies that want to sell their products.</p>
            <p>Victor Queiroz, who works for ApexBrasil (Brazil's export and investment agency) in Asia-Pacific, said that China is interested in many things from Brazil. These include computer parts, fruit juices, frozen foods, shipping, clean energy, eco-friendly airplane fuel, and health care. His agency has made a list of over 400 products that Brazil can sell to China.</p>
            <p>Fagner Santos, an expert from JF Comex, a Brazilian advising company, said that the high taxes from the US are not going away. He said it is very risky for Brazil to rely too much on the US market. Now is the time for small and medium-sized businesses in Brazil to take this chance. Companies should actively try to enter the Chinese market, visit China, make connections, and plan carefully.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Kirog is coming; Wu Derong says East and South Taiwan should prepare for heavy rain</h1>
            <p>Medium Typhoon Kirog is moving closer to Taiwan. Today, weather expert Wu Derong warned that the eastern and southern parts of Taiwan should prepare for heavy rain that can cause damage. Hualien and Taitung should get ready for very strong, damaging winds.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong, who is also a professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column, "Leak Heaven's Secrets Classroom," that Typhoon Kirog will hit Taiwan tomorrow. The eastern and southern parts must prepare for heavy rain that can cause damage. Hualien and Taitung must be very careful about "destructive" strong winds near the typhoon's center.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong said that the newest path forecast from Taiwan's Central Weather Administration and the average path from the latest European computer models both show that Kirog will land in Taitung around noon tomorrow. Then, it will land in Fujian, China, early on the 14th. Before it lands, the typhoon is expected to remain a medium typhoon. After it hits land, the mountains will weaken it quickly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu said that because the area where the typhoon lands will definitely face very strong winds from its center, both Hualien and Taitung should be extra careful. The Weather Administration's "Quantitative Rainfall Forecast" shows that both eastern and southern Taiwan should be careful of heavy rain that can cause damage.</p>
            <p>Today, at 5:30 AM, the Weather Administration already issued a sea warning for Medium Typhoon Kirog. It warned the coastal areas like Keelung's North Coast, eastern Taiwan, and Hengchun Peninsula to be careful of big waves.</p>

            <h1>US steel plant explosion in Pennsylvania kills at least 1, injures dozens</h1>
            <p>Officials in the United States said that there was an explosion at a U.S. Steel factory in Pennsylvania. At least one person died, and dozens of people were hurt. Rescue workers are still looking for people.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro wrote on X (social media) that "several explosions happened today at the U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works." This plant is about 25 kilometers from Pittsburgh.</p>
            <p>He also said that "injured workers have been taken to local hospitals for treatment. Rescue work at the factory is still ongoing."</p>
            <p>Police in Allegheny County posted on Facebook that "officials can now confirm that one person has died in this event."</p>
            <p>John Fetterman, a US Senator from Pennsylvania, also wrote on X that "dozens of people" were injured.</p>
            <p>Some US news reports said that there are still people stuck under the broken parts at the site of the explosion. U.S. Steel has not yet answered AFP's request for a comment.</p>
