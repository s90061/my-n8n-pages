US President Donald Trump extended the pause on reciprocal tariffs until August 1st. Because of this, the main stock markets in Europe closed a little higher today. American stocks stayed mostly flat during the day, as there was some uncertainty about the US trade policy.

**About 500 Travelers Still Stuck in Kinmen and Matsu, Military Planes to Help**

Around 500 travelers are still stuck in Kinmen and Matsu because of Typhoon Danas. They need help to leave. On late Tuesday night, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said that they are arranging extra flights and also asking for military planes to help with transportation.

The CAA said in a statement on Tuesday evening that for Wednesday's transport plan, most travelers stuck in Kinmen due to the typhoon have been moved. However, because of delays from the past two days and many travelers arriving from the "mini-three links" in the afternoon, civil and military planes are still moving people. They have also asked Songshan Airport to stay open longer, until 0:20 AM on Wednesday. About 200 travelers are still there and will be moved on Wednesday. Four extra flights have been arranged, and military planes have been requested to help.

The CAA said that in Matsu, transport started only on Tuesday because of the typhoon. Besides civil aircraft, military planes also began helping. Currently, about 300 travelers are still stuck. The airport is telling travelers to take boats if possible, and has also asked the Ministry of National Defense to send military planes on Wednesday.

**King Charles Welcomes Macron, Hopes to Make UK-France Ties Stronger**

Today, King Charles III of the UK welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron. This is the first time a European leader has made a state visit to the UK since it left the European Union. Their warm welcome shows that the relationship between the UK and France is getting closer again.

Reuters reported that Macron, who is good friends with King Charles III, was visiting the UK as a special guest for the first time. They both smiled when they met. Macron's wife, Brigitte, and Queen Camilla were with them. Soldiers on horseback, dressed in blue uniforms and red feathered hats, watched from nearby.

King Charles will later give a speech at the castle where he is hosting Macron. He is expected to talk about the "many difficult threats" that both the UK and France face together. Earlier, after arriving in the UK, Macron also posted on social media that the two countries "can work together on so many things." The two couples, King Charles and Queen Camilla, and President Macron and Brigitte Macron, rode in several horse-drawn carriages through Windsor town, west of London. They ended their procession at Windsor Castle, a medieval castle, with Prince William and Princess Catherine of the UK also with them.
