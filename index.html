            <h1>Good Morning World: NT$10,000 Cash Handouts to Start in Early November, First Batch to Be Directly Deposited</h1>
            <p>On October 17, the Legislative Yuan will vote on a special budget bill to give out cash to everyone. The Minister of Finance, Chuang Tsui-yun, said on October 16 that the government plans five ways for people to get the money: direct deposit, online registration for deposit, ATM withdrawal, post office pickup, and list-based distribution. The Ministry of Finance expects to start giving out the money in early November. Those who choose direct deposit will be the first to receive it. Also, the Criminal Investigation Bureau has received two reports of scams related to the cash handout, with about NT$560,000 already stolen. The public is warned to only use websites ending in ".gov".</p>
            <p>More than NT$1.2 billion has been raised for the Hualien flood disaster. The first payments of comfort money have been given out. Now, plans for long-term support and care for those affected have also started. On October 16, the Disaster Relief Foundation announced a living allowance plan. Families in need and those who lost family members in the disaster will receive NT$30,000 and NT$25,000 per month, respectively, for 12 months. The money will be paid all at once. Separately, as Typhoon Fengshen might form, Ji Liancheng, the coordinator general of the Central Emergency Operation Center, said that people will be moved out in three steps, depending on rainfall and dike water levels. Also, to keep clear rules for moving people, volunteers will not be allowed into the disaster area from October 18.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration announced that the weather will be hot until October 18. Most areas in the west will have high temperatures of 33 to 35 degrees Celsius, and the east will be 31 to 32 degrees Celsius. Only areas facing the wind, such as Keelung's north coast, Taipei's mountainous areas, the east, and Hengchun Peninsula, will have occasional short showers. A tropical disturbance in the south is expected to become a tropical depression on October 17 and Typhoon Fengshen on October 18. This typhoon will combine with the northeast monsoon, bringing a lot of rain to some parts of Taiwan from October 19 to 21. People in northern Taiwan, Yilan, and Hualien should prepare for heavy rain.</p>
            <p>TSMC, a company that makes computer chips, held an online meeting for investors on October 16. The chairman and CEO, C. C. Wei, said that because the demand for AI is stronger than they thought, the company expects its dollar revenue to grow by nearly 35% in 2025. This is the second time TSMC has raised its business forecast after increasing it to 30% in July. TSMC also announced that its gross profit margin for the third quarter was 59.5%, which is 0.9 percentage points higher than the second quarter. The net profit belonging to the parent company was NT$452.3 billion, a new record. Wei added that the 2-nanometer chip production will start in the fourth quarter as planned and will grow quickly next year.</p>
            <p>US President Trump put higher taxes on India because it did not stop buying oil from Russia. This made it harder for the US and India to work together against China. On October 15, Trump said that Indian Prime Minister Modi promised him that India would stop buying oil from Russia. Trump also said that his next step would be to try to convince China to do the same. However, India's Ministry of External Affairs did not directly comment on this. They only said that their purchases are based on what is best for Indian consumers. But they did mention that the US wants to work more closely on energy.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that the US relies heavily on China for making medicines. An analysis found that China is the only supplier for at least one important chemical ingredient in many common antibiotics and generic drugs used for heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, and AIDS. Because making these chemicals can harm the environment, and because labor and other costs are too high in the US, there are almost no factories in the US that make them. Experts are worried that this dependence could put American patients at risk, especially if there is a trade war or another major illness in the future, which might cause China to limit exports again.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that China's missile ability is growing fast. The Pentagon is working hard to strengthen its base in Guam. This is to stop China from attacking Taiwan and to prepare for any conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Guam is closer to Beijing than Hawaii, which is part of the US. Guam is now a very important place in the Pacific. On October 16, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said that this is certainly a response to China's growing military power. He believes that other areas in the first island chain, besides Taiwan, are also closely connected. Taiwan will work with other countries that share similar ideas to keep the area stable.</p>
            <p>The Frankfurt Book Fair has started, with over a thousand writers and publishers from 92 countries attending. The Taiwan Pavilion showed works by six featured writers. These works talked about spirits and ghosts, which are important parts of Taiwan's culture. These stories caught the attention of international readers and publishers, who discussed the cultural meaning of "ghosts." For example, the poet Wu Huai-chen's "Island of Divine Entropy" explores Taiwan's earliest ideas about life through myths. The crime novelist Hsiao Wei-hsuan looks at human nature and sees "ghosts" as a reflection of what is in people's hearts.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is hearing the Jinghua City case. On October 9, Ying Hsiao-wei, who is out on bail, reportedly bothered a witness from the city's urban development department during questioning. The Taipei court then held a special hearing and called Ying Hsiao-wei to explain. Prosecutors said that Ying Hsiao-wei used her power as a council member to pressure the witness. Ying Hsiao-wei said she did not mean to do it. She only wanted to remind Mayor Chiang Wan-an to fix things in the city government and that they should not record things without permission. The court decided that what Ying Hsiao-wei said during the questioning might have affected the witness's statement. So, they asked her to pay an extra NT$5 million for bail.</p>
            <p>Taiwan High Speed Rail has been using "quiet carriages" for over three weeks, with more than 17,000 cases of people being reminded to be quiet. On October 16, the High Speed Rail company said that babies, young children, and passengers who cannot control themselves due to illness are not included in the rules for reminding people. From now on, staff will only give gentle reminders and guidance. Other countries' train systems also have different rules. For example, Belgium tried "quiet zones" where people could not talk, phones had to be silent, and headphones were needed for music, videos, or social media. This was popular, and they expanded it last year. In France, people who want quiet can choose first-class or business seats, while parents with children can choose special family areas.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan and Japan Share Hardship: Kasama City, Ibaraki Prefecture, Donates Money for Hualien Flood Relief</h1>
            <p>On October 16, Lee Yi-yang, Taiwan's representative in Japan, met with Nobuki Yamaguchi, the mayor of Kasama City and head of the Kasama City Agricultural Public Corporation. Lee received a donation from the corporation to help with the recovery after the Hualien flood in Taiwan. Lee sincerely thanked Mayor Yamaguchi and the people of Kasama for their kindness. He said that the people of Kasama quickly sent their condolences after the disaster, which greatly encouraged the people in the Hualien affected area.</p>
            <p>Lee Yi-yang stated that the Hualien flood caused 19 deaths and over a hundred injuries. Many areas in Guangfu Township were covered in mud and water, and many homes were badly damaged. Recovery work is still going on. Volunteers from all over Taiwan, known as "Shovel Superheroes," went into the disaster area to help with cleaning and rescue. So far, about 500,000 people have helped with the recovery. The Taiwanese government and private groups have worked together to quickly fix roads, bridges, and other important structures. Traffic is now back to normal in most areas.</p>
            <p>Lee also mentioned that many plumbers and electricians stopped their own work and went to the disaster area to help restore water and electricity, which was very touching.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that Taiwan and Japan are "friends who share hardships." From Taiwan's 921 earthquake and Hualien earthquake to Japan's 311 earthquake and Noto Peninsula earthquake, Taiwan and Japan have faced disasters together. "Even when natural disasters threaten us, our hearts remain close." When the 311 earthquake happened, more than 20 people died in Ibaraki Prefecture, and Taiwan expressed deep sadness.</p>
            <p>Lee Yi-yang said that last year during the APEC leaders' meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Taiwan's representative Lin Hsin-i also agreed that cooperation between Taiwan and Japan in disaster prevention is important. Lee emphasized that both places often face natural disasters. Taiwan can learn from Japan's experience in disaster prevention, and Taiwan can also share its experience in evacuation and rescue, and how private groups help. Both sides have had many discussions. He hopes that by sharing experiences, they can reduce how much damage disasters cause.</p>
            <p>Mayor Yamaguchi Nobuki said that whenever Japan suffers a disaster, Taiwan is always the first to offer help. Kasama City has an office in Taiwan and feels great sorrow over the damage caused by the Hualien flood. They are making this donation to show their care and sympathy, hoping that the affected area can rebuild and return to normal life soon.</p>

            <h1>Loan Risk Makes Investors Worried, US Bank Stocks Fall Sharply</h1>
            <p>Today, American bank stocks fell a lot. Banks like Zions Bancorporation, Jefferies, and Western Alliance were among them. Investors are worried because banks have recently been affected by two car companies going bankrupt.</p>
            <p>Zions Bancorporation's stock price dropped by 12%. This bank announced that its California branch will lose $50 million in the third quarter because of two commercial and industrial loans.</p>
            <p>Western Alliance's stock price fell nearly 11% after the bank announced it was suing Cantor Group V, LLC, saying the company committed fraud.</p>
            <p>Jefferies also saw its stock price drop by 9%. This was after the company said it had given loans to First Brands, a car parts maker that is now bankrupt.</p>
            <p>Stephen Biggar, a bank analyst at Argus Research, said, "This shows that the quality of loans should never be taken lightly. If one bank's loan quality gets worse, it can quickly affect the whole banking sector."</p>
            <p>Jefferies and Zions Bancorporation did not answer Reuters' requests for comments.</p>
            <p>Stock companies mentioned comments made by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon this week. He said that the bankruptcies of First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor are causing worry in the credit market.</p>
            <p>Big banks are reporting claims for unsecured loans. This situation is an important test for how clear and well-managed the fast-growing private credit market is.</p>
            <p>This drop in bank stocks happened more than two years after Silicon Valley Bank failed in 2023. At that time, high interest rates caused the bank to lose a lot of money on its bonds. This led to many people taking their money out of the bank, which then caused Signature Bank to also fail.</p>
            <p>The bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor have again brought attention to how banks manage risks and the lack of transparency in the credit market. This market has complicated loan structures and new ways of lending money, which makes it harder to understand how much risk is involved.</p>
