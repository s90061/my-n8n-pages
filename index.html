            <h1>Chinese Media: Restrictions on Wanda Group Chairman Wang Jianlin Lifted</h1>
            <p>Wang Jianlin, who used to be the richest man in China and is the chairman of Wanda Group, was recently stopped from high-level spending by a court order. However, Chinese news outlets like Caixin reported that these restrictions have now been removed.</p>
            <p>According to news sources such as Caixin, checks on September 29 showed that there was no longer any information about Wang Jianlin being restricted from high-level spending on China's official enforcement information website. Also, other information from Qichacha did not show any high-spending risks for Wang Jianlin.</p>
            <p>On September 28, Yicai and 21st Century Business Herald reported that someone inside Wanda told the media, "The spending limit was due to a business problem with a Wanda project company. Both sides had been trying to solve it in different ways. We are checking the details now. This might have happened because of wrong information during the process."</p>
            <p>Wang Jianlin was once the richest man in China. In 2015, his wealth reached 260 billion RMB (which was about 1.3 trillion New Taiwan Dollars at that time). He topped the "Hurun Global Rich List for Chinese People" and became China's richest man.</p>
            <p>After his wealth peaked in 2016, it has been decreasing for 10 years. In 2019, Wang Jianlin's assets dropped greatly from 156.63 billion RMB to 88.39 billion RMB compared to the year before. Because he kept selling assets to pay off debts, by 2024, his assets had shrunk by 80% compared to 10 years ago, and he left the Hurun Rich List.</p>

            <h1>Gongguan Traffic Now Normal After Changes, Will Add Signs for Scooter Left-Turn Area</h1>
            <p>Today, the Gongguan traffic circle in Taipei City was changed into a normal intersection between Roosevelt Road and Keelung Road. Vice Mayor Li Sichuan visited this morning. He said that traffic was normal during the holiday, but tomorrow's rush hour will be the real test. He also saw that some scooter riders were afraid to turn left directly. So, the city will add more signs to show the scooter left-turn area.</p>
            <p>From 6 AM today, the Gongguan traffic circle became a normal intersection. Almost all cars and scooters can now turn left directly. Only scooters coming from Fuhe Bridge still need to make a two-stage left turn. However, a waiting area is still marked for riders who prefer to use it.</p>
            <p>This morning, Taipei City Government officials, led by Vice Mayor Li Sichuan, including Transportation Department Director Hsieh Ming-hung and Public Works Department Director Huang Yi-ping, were there to check the traffic situation on the first day.</p>
            <p>Li Sichuan said today is a holiday for Teacher's Day, so there are fewer cars than on a normal weekday, but still more than a typical holiday. He said the traffic looked normal. For example, buses can now pass more quickly because they don't have to go underground and come back up like before. However, he noted that tomorrow, when people go to work and school, will be the real test.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-hung said that tomorrow they will change the traffic light times. For instance, today the green light was shorter during off-peak hours. Tomorrow, they will use longer green light times for peak hours, so buses have more time to cross the new intersection.</p>
            <p>Li Sichuan said that some scooter riders were still afraid to wait in the dashed area for the left-turn signal. This area is marked for left turns. He thinks they are not used to it yet. So, the city will add more clear signs for the scooter left-turn waiting area, to help riders understand and use it better.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-hung also said that the Gongguan traffic circle will soon be a thing of the past. He added that some scooter riders might be scared to turn left directly because the intersection looks big.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Hsieh Ming-hung said that the sidewalks in the turning areas will be made wider in the next two weeks. This will make the walking distance shorter for pedestrians. Police and volunteer traffic officers will also be there to guide people at all times.</p>

            <h1>Australian Media: China Quickly Builds Commercial Ferries to Get Ready for Invading Taiwan</h1>
            <p>A secret US military report seen by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) shows that China is quickly making its commercial ferry fleet bigger. This is to help China invade Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) wrote a report for the Pentagon earlier this year. It said that China's big ocean ferries have been changed so they can carry tanks and take part in beach landings.</p>
            <p>ABC got this report and agreed not to quote from it directly to protect the people who gave the information.</p>
            <p>The report says that in 2022 alone, the "Five Eyes" intelligence group watched about 30 Chinese commercial ferries taking part in military exercises with the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Five Eyes group includes intelligence agencies from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the US, and Canada.</p>
            <p>ABC also pointed out that China plans to build more than 70 large ferries by the end of 2026. Taiwan sees this as part of China's "plans to expand" against Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's representative in Australia, Hsu Yu-tien, told ABC, "We also see more and more 'gray zone tactics' from China. For example, cyber attacks are used to weaken Taiwan's democracy and society."</p>
            <p>He added, "Using civilian boats or other things that have both civilian and military uses at sea is also part of China's plan."</p>
            <h3>New Landing Barges</h3>
            <p>Satellite information shows that China tested new landing barges on its coast earlier this year. It also used these barges with its landing forces in military exercises. These barges have very long ramps at the front and loading ramps at the back. They can connect smoothly with Ro-Ro (Roll-on/Roll-off) ferries to make a long chain for landing operations.</p>
            <p>The US Defense Department's report believes that if there is a conflict with China, these commercial ferries might become military targets. This means that even if there are civilian crew members on board, the US military might sink these ferries during a crisis in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>The US Indo-Pacific Command is more and more worried about this. An internal paper said, "Putting troops directly into a battle zone is an act of war usually done by military ships. But the Chinese army seems to want to use commercial Ro-Ro ferries for this."</p>
            <h3>Satellite Pictures Show Preparations</h3>
            <p>The US think tank, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said that China plans to build more than 70 large ferries by the end of next year. These ferries usually carry people and goods, but sometimes they are seen in exercises with the People's Liberation Army.</p>
            <p>Hu Bo, director of Peking University's Center for Ocean Strategy Research, said that the US intelligence report is a "clear threat" to China. He said that it is normal for China to get ready for a possible crisis in the Taiwan Strait, and it does not mean they will act immediately.</p>
            <p>The US intelligence community believes that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the military to be ready to attack Taiwan by 2027. One of the biggest problems is whether China can get a lot of soldiers and equipment onto the beaches.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, many photos appeared on Chinese social media. They showed mystery landing barges taking part in exercises about 350 kilometers southwest of Guangzhou.</p>
            <p>James Corera, an expert from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), said, "China is clearly building the ability to invade Taiwan."</p>
            <h3>What Do These Pictures Show?</h3>
            <p>The US intelligence report found that China has 3 different sizes of new landing barges. The shortest is 110 meters, and the longest is 185 meters. They can form a pier that can help troops and vehicles land on beaches.</p>
            <p>Satellite pictures show that Chinese shipyards are building more landing barges.</p>
            <p>The US Naval War College said that these landing barges seem to be made to work with China's Ro-Ro ferries. They can connect to each other to form a floating pier up to 820 meters long.</p>
            <p>Corera said, "China is building moving ports. But they only make sense if China controls the sea first. The barges themselves cannot take beaches. They can only be used after the beaches are taken."</p>
            <h3>What are Ro-Ro Ferries?</h3>
            <p>Ro-Ro ferries are commercial cargo ships that can carry hundreds of passengers and vehicles.</p>
            <p>As early as 2019, a 15,000-ton Ro-Ro ferry called "Bangchuidao" took part in a Chinese military landing exercise.</p>
            <p>According to CSIS, China will build 76 large ferries for its own use from 2023 to 2026. The report said, "There is clear proof that the Chinese military plans to use Ro-Ro ferries to help with military actions."</p>
            <p>Corera said that these ferries, which are owned by state companies and changed for "defense needs," have been used in the Chinese military's landing exercises. This shows that Xi Jinping's plan for "military-civilian fusion" is making big progress.</p>
            <h3>Are Chinese Ferries and Landing Barges New?</h3>
            <p>Other countries like the US have also used similar ferries to move troops in peaceful times. However, the large number of China's Ro-Ro ferries creates a problem for the US military: in a Taiwan Strait crisis, they might have to sink civilian ships.</p>
            <p>Under the "laws of war," attacking civilian ships goes against international rules, unless they are used clearly for military purposes. A document from the US Indo-Pacific Command says that if ferries are controlled by the Chinese military, they are legal military targets.</p>
            <p>However, Corera said that what is really important to watch are China's frequent training, aircraft carriers, and rocket forces. The ferries and landing barges might just be a "distraction."</p>
            <p>Hu Bo warned that if the US tries to destroy Chinese ships in a Taiwan Strait crisis, "it will face very strong counteractions."</p>
            <p>The US Defense Department and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles did not want to comment.</p>
