            <h1>Lin Yu-Chang Starts Industry Learning Trip; First Stop is Dallas for High-Tech Industry</h1>
            <p>Lin Yu-Chang, who used to be the Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party, left for the US tonight. He is starting a trip to learn about industries. Many people see him as a strong candidate for Taipei Mayor. He said that the world is facing a big change, just like after the Cold War ended in 1989 and the economy became global. This new change will affect Taiwan's ability to compete in the world. He believes this is a challenge but also a great chance.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-Chang posted on Facebook tonight that he took an EVA Air flight to the US. But this time, he is not going to Washington D.C., which is the usual political center. He is also not going as a visiting scholar. Instead, he is going to Dallas, Austin in Texas, and Phoenix in Arizona to visit different industries.</p>
            <p>He wants to go to these places to see what is happening. He wants to understand how the semiconductor, AI, and high-tech industries are changing in Taiwan and the US. He will talk to workers and managers directly. He will also learn from Taiwanese business people and managers in the US. This way, he can get new information and find out about any problems. Then, he can think about what to do next.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-Chang repeated that the world is going through a huge change, similar to the one after the Cold War in 1989 when the economy became global. This change, which is another big shift in 30 years, is important for Taiwan's ability to survive and compete. He sees it as a difficult time, but also a very good chance for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-Chang flew on an EVA Air flight that started flying to Dallas in early October. He said that in the past, when Taiwanese people thought of Texas, they might think of steak, oil fields, rockets, and space shuttles. But now, Texas is one of the best places for Taiwan's high-tech companies to go in the US. Dallas, Houston, and Austin have become the new important centers for high-tech industries in America.</p>
            <p>He also said that it is getting easier to travel between Taiwan and Texas. He believes that trade and business between the two places will grow a lot in the future. He hopes to see people in Dallas.</p>

            <h1>Trump: 100% Tariffs on China are Not Sustainable in the Long Run</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said that his idea to put a 100% tax on goods from China "cannot continue for a long time." However, he also blamed China for the recent halt in trade talks. He said that Beijing started the problem by controlling the export of rare earth metals more strictly.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Trump was asked on Fox Business Network today if such high taxes could last and what they might do to the economy. He replied, "This cannot continue, but the numbers are like this... they made me do it."</p>
            <p>One week ago, Trump announced that starting from November 1, he would add a 100% tax on goods that China sends to the US. He also said there would be controls on exporting "all important software."</p>
            <p>During the same interview, Trump confirmed that he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks. He also spoke highly of the Chinese leader.</p>
            <p>In a TV show called "Mornings with Maria," which was recorded yesterday, Trump said, "I think we will be fine with China, but we must make a fair agreement. It must be fair."</p>

            <p>Baek Se-Hee, the popular South Korean writer of the book "I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki," has sadly passed away today at the age of 35. During her life, she wrote about depression in a very detailed way, which many readers around the world understood. She also donated her organs, saving five lives.</p>
            <p>News organizations like the BBC reported that Baek Se-Hee published "I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki" in 2018. In the book, she wrote about her conversations with a psychiatrist. She talked about mental health problems, and her book became very popular.</p>
            <p>This best-selling book received a lot of praise. This is because the author encouraged people to talk openly about mental health. She also used very careful words to describe her inner struggles. Especially, she showed how she felt torn between sad thoughts and being thankful for small happy things in life.</p>
            <p>The Korea JoongAng Daily reported that many famous people suggested reading "I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki." This included RM (Kim Nam-joon), a member of the South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
            <p>The Korean Organ Donation Agency announced today that Baek Se-Hee donated her heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. These donations saved five lives.</p>
            <p>According to the Korean Organ Donation Agency, Baek Se-Hee's sister said, "My sister's dream was to connect with others and build hope through her writing. Knowing her kind heart, which never held anger, we wish her peace in heaven now."</p>
            <p>Since "I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki" was first published in Korean in 2018, more than a million copies have been sold worldwide. An English version was released in 2022, and it has been translated into 25 languages.</p>
