            <h1>US, South Korea, Japan Military Drills: Kim Yo Jong Warns of Bad Outcomes</h1>
            <p>North Korea's state media reported today that Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has given a warning. She said that the joint military exercises by the United States, South Korea, and Japan could cause "bad outcomes" for these countries.</p>
            <p>The military in South Korea announced that South Korea, Japan, and the United States will start their yearly defense drills called "Freedom Edge" on September 15. These drills are meant to make their air, sea, and internet fighting skills better. This is to protect against North Korea's threats from nuclear weapons and missiles.</p>
            <p>Kim Yo Jong said through the official North Korean news agency (KCNA): "The three countries, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, are showing their military strength without thinking, in the wrong place, close to North Korea. This will certainly only bring bad results for them."</p>
            <p>South Korean news also reported that South Korea and the United States plan to have "Iron Mace" practice games next week. These games will bring together their regular and nuclear fighting skills to deal with threats from North Korea.</p>
            <p>Pak Jong Chon, an important official in North Korea's Workers' Party, also released a statement through KCNA. He said that if "enemy groups" keep showing their military power with these joint exercises, North Korea will take "stronger and clearer" actions in return.</p>
            <p>North Korea has always said that these joint exercises are like practice for attacking them. Sometimes, North Korea has reacted by testing weapons. But South Korea and the U.S. say these exercises are only for defense.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Plans for New Nuclear Energy: 4-Year Research Project for SMRs and MMRs</h1>
            <p>President Lai has said that Taiwan might use new nuclear energy. It is now known that the Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) will start a research project next year. This project will cost 100 million New Taiwan Dollars and will focus on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The goal is to create rules and ways to check SMRs in Taiwan. Also, a bigger plan for four years has been made. This plan will cover safety technology for SMRs and Micro Modular Reactors (MMRs) and will cost 800 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>A vote about restarting the third nuclear power plant happened recently. Even though not enough people voted "yes" for it to pass, more people voted "yes" than "no" in all cities and counties. In Hengchun Township, where the third nuclear power plant is, more than 60% of people voted "yes." After the vote, President Lai Ching-te told Taipower to check the safety of old nuclear power plants. He also said again that he "does not rule out using new nuclear energy."</p>
            <p>The Nuclear Safety Commission has been studying new nuclear energy for some years. It is said that next year, they will present a plan called "Research Project on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) that are low-carbon and have high energy." The National Atomic Energy Technology Institute will lead this project. It will cost about 100 million New Taiwan Dollars, but the money still needs to be approved by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the future, the Nuclear Safety Commission will plan a four-year project. This long-term plan will build up skills in safety technology for SMRs and Micro Modular Reactors (MMRs). The first cost for this plan is about 800 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Officials explained that next year's plan will first work on the technology needed to bring in SMRs. This will give the government the technical and legal facts to decide about new nuclear energy. It will also create ways to approve and check SMRs in Taiwan, and train a team for SMRs. This will make it quicker to use SMRs and make sure Taiwan has different choices for energy.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has been trying to become a "nuclear-free country" in recent years. Because of this, fewer people are needed to work in nuclear power. So, the National Atomic Energy Technology Institute has planned to send students to places like Europe, America, and Japan. They will do short research jobs in labs or study nuclear engineering at famous universities around the world. They will also hire experts from other countries or Taiwanese scholars living abroad when needed. This will bring in new international technology and ideas, and mix them with local teams.</p>
            <p>If private groups, including schools, want to bring in new nuclear power plants, the Nuclear Safety Commission said this: new types of reactors are still being researched and made around the world. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan are doing this research, but they are not ready to be used for business yet. The United States is also still making rules for checking new types of reactors. The Nuclear Safety Commission will watch how these international rules change.</p>

            <h1>iPhone Air's Single Camera Has New Feature: Full Portrait Mode Unlocked</h1>
            <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 phones will be for sale on September 19th. Some careful foreign news sources have seen that the new iPhone Air only has one camera. This is because Apple wanted to make the phone thinner. But this one camera can use all the features of "Portrait Mode." This is the first time an iPhone with one camera can do this.</p>
            <p>Apple's Portrait Mode feature was first put into iPhones with one back camera with the iPhone XR in 2018. But at that time, you could only take pictures of people and pets. If you took a picture of something else, like a flower or a view, Portrait Mode would not work. It couldn't make the main thing in the picture stand out clearly from the background.</p>
            <p>The cheaper iPhone SE phones, which came out in 2020 and 2022, had the same rule. You could only take pictures of people and pets. Even the iPhone 16e, released in February this year, is the same.</p>
            <p>But a tech news website called 9to5Mac reported that the new iPhone Air's single camera can now use all of Portrait Mode. It can take "new generation" portrait photos. This means it can take pictures of anything, control how blurry the background is, and change where the picture is clear. When you take a normal photo, the camera will also save information about the background automatically. So, even if you forget to turn on Portrait Mode when you take a photo, you can change it later.</p>
            <p>iPhone Air's portrait photos also use HDR technology. This means the phone takes many pictures very fast at different brightness levels. Then it puts them together to show more details in bright and dark parts of the picture. Also, it takes better photos when there is not much light.</p>
            <p>9to5Mac said that some people think it is not good that the iPhone Air only has one camera. But because it can use all of Portrait Mode, more people might want to buy this phone.</p>
            <p>The iPhone Air has a large screen, 6.5 inches, called Super Retina XDR. It is very thin, only 5.6 mm. This is 0.2 mm thinner than the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which is a competing phone. It also has a battery that lasts all day, and you can watch videos for up to 27 hours. It has more Apple-made chips inside than any iPhone before. This makes it the thinnest and most energy-saving iPhone ever made.</p>
