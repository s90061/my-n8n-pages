            <h1>EU Submits Free Trade Agreement with 4 South American Countries, Awaiting Member State Approval</h1>
            <p>Today, the European Union (EU) sent a big trade agreement with four South American countries to its member countries for approval. This agreement is with the "Mercosur" group. The EU also told France, which was the most against it, that the agreement has strong rules to protect farmers.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, this agreement is important for the EU to find new markets. This is happening because the US has added more taxes on EU products. The agreement will create the world's largest free trade area, with over 700 million buyers. But France was against it because of worries about farming.</p>
            <p>Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, said when she gave the agreement: "Businesses and farms in the EU will benefit right away. Taxes and costs will go down, which will help the economy grow."</p>
            <p>Antonio Costa, the head of the European Council, also supported this important trade agreement. He said that the final version from the European Commission "solved many of the most difficult problems."</p>
            <p>Costa was in Vienna with Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker. He told reporters: "This will be a great chance to make us more competitive and open markets to new products and services." But Austria was against this agreement.</p>
            <p>Last December, the EU and Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) agreed on the deal. This happened 25 years after they started talking about it. Today, the European Commission finally let the agreement go forward.</p>
            <p>However, the agreement still needs approval from the European Parliament. It also needs approval from 15 of the 27 EU countries, which must make up at least 65% of the total EU population. Only then can it officially start.</p>
            <p>Maros Sefcovic, the EU Commissioner for trade, said at a press conference that he hopes the approval process will finish by the end of the year.</p>
            <p>Most EU countries, led by Germany, support this agreement. Even though the EU recently made a trade deal with the US, the US still adds taxes to EU goods. Countries like Germany want to spread out their trade risks by making a deal with Mercosur.</p>
            <p>The agreement states that Mercosur will slowly remove import taxes on 91% of EU goods. These goods include cars, chemicals, wine, and chocolate. Currently, these goods can have taxes as high as 35%.</p>
            <p>The European Commission thinks that the agreement will increase the EU's yearly exports to the four South American countries by up to 39%, or 49 billion euros (about 1.75 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). This will also help the EU compete better against countries like China in South America.</p>

            <h1>Former Navy Captain Goes to China for Military Parade; Lawmaker Calls for Law Amendment to Fix Loopholes</h1>
            <p>A former Navy captain, Lieutenant Commander Lu Li-shih, was invited to a military parade in China on September 3rd. This caused a lot of discussion. Today, Chiu Chih-wei, a lawmaker from the DPP party, said that the law about relations between Taiwan and China only stops retired generals from joining Chinese military or political events. He said this rule is not strong enough. He believes Taiwan needs to quickly fix this gap in the law. He also said the KMT party should not keep stopping the changes to the law. If they do, they will let the country down.</p>
            <p>Media reports say that when Lu Li-shih talked to an overseas Chinese news company, he said that Taiwan's laws cannot stop officers below the rank of general. He asked why he should stop himself from going.</p>
            <p>Chiu Chih-wei said that last November, he already suggested a change. He wanted to change Article 9-3 of the law. This article currently only stops retired generals (major general or higher) from joining Chinese military or political events. He wanted to change it so that all officers from lieutenant commander (major) and above, who receive a lifelong pension, cannot join. But when people paid less attention, the KMT party removed the article and put it aside. This stopped the article from even being discussed in a committee.</p>
            <p>Chiu Chih-wei said that making stricter laws and punishments will definitely work. This time, not many retired officers went to China for the September 3rd parade. Also, Yen De-fa, the head of the Veterans Affairs Council, supports his plan to change the law for stricter punishments. Only the KMT party, which is friendly with China, does not support it.</p>
            <p>Chiu Chih-wei said that the gap in the law should be fixed as soon as possible. He said that retired officers should not be allowed to go to China and speak badly about Taiwan. He asked the KMT party to stop blocking the law changes. If they do not, they will be letting the country down.</p>

            <h1>Hsu Jo-hsi's Perfect Game Challenge Fails in 7th Inning; Says Lin Chih-ping is "Older and Wiser"</h1>
            <p>Hsu Jo-hsi, the "Son of the Dragons" from the Wei Chuan Dragons baseball team, pitched 7 innings today without giving up any hits. But in the 7th inning, he walked a batter, and his chance for a perfect game ended. After the game, he said he felt upset because Lin Chih-ping did not swing the bat, which was a pity. Hsu Jo-hsi said, "It's true that older people are wiser."</p>
            <p>Today, the Wei Chuan Dragons played against the Rakuten Monkeys at the Taipei Dome. Hsu Jo-hsi had a chance for a perfect game until the 7th inning. But with two outs, he threw 8 pitches to Lin Chih-ping and then walked him, ending his perfect game try. In total, Hsu Jo-hsi threw 98 pitches over 7 innings. He did not give up any hits, walked one batter, and struck out 8 batters. He did not let the other team score. However, the Dragons lost the game 1-2 to the Monkeys in the end.</p>
            <p>After the game, Hsu Jo-hsi said he did not think much about the perfect game. He just "kept pitching." He also said that his teammates did not change much during the game. "Nobody talked about it. They warmed up as usual, and they went out to play as usual. Everything was the same as always."</p>
            <p>After walking Lin Chih-ping in the 7th inning, Hsu Jo-hsi looked upset. He explained, "I know senior player Chih-ping is very good at hitting and thinking. So, I had to keep working hard against him. I still threw the ball well after that, but maybe he chose better. I think it was a pity that he didn't swing at that pitch; he usually would. Older people are indeed wiser."</p>
            <p>Before this game, Hsu Jo-hsi had an infection in his left leg from an insect bite. Because of this, it had been 16 days since his last game. Even though he had not given up any hits after the 7th inning, he did not continue pitching. Hsu Jo-hsi said, "Maybe because it had been 16 days, and I suddenly had to pitch with such high effort, the coach was worried that something might go wrong and cause pain."</p>
            <p>Hsu Jo-hsi mentioned that resting for many days is good for recovery. However, he had only done simple practice throws in between. "When I started pitching in the game, the effort was a bit higher. I need to find a way to keep it up, and even if I feel good, I shouldn't always use all my strength."</p>
