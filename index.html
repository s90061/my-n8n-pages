            <h1>National Palace Museum's Czech exhibition opens; Vystrƒçil: An excellent example of cultural institution cooperation</h1>
            <p>The special exhibition "One Hundred Treasures from the National Palace Museum and Their Stories" started on September 11th in the Czech Republic. The President of the Czech Senate, Milo≈° Vystrƒçil, said that he saw these unique artworks when he visited Taiwan in 2020. He called this exhibition "a great example of how cultural organizations can work together." He also said it shows that culture can bring people together from different continents.</p>
            <p>The National Palace Museum is celebrating its 100th anniversary with its first overseas exhibition, "One Hundred Treasures from the National Palace Museum and Their Stories." It opened on September 11th at the National Museum of the Czech Republic. The exhibition shows 131 precious items. The famous "Jadeite Cabbage" is shown in Europe for the first time. Other classic items like "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" and "Multifaceted Cabinet" are also there.</p>
            <p>Vystrƒçil went to the opening party on September 11th. He looked at the exhibition with a guide. He took a photo with the "Jadeite Cabbage" and tried the interactive displays, including an experience where he could "walk into the painting."</p>
            <p>On September 12th, Vystrƒçil posted on Facebook. He said that the very special exhibition "One Hundred Treasures from the National Palace Museum and Their Stories" is now open to the public at the National Museum of the Czech Republic. He added that this shows the good and continuing cultural work between the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the National Museum of the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>Vystrƒçil explained that the exhibition displays valuable artworks collected by Chinese emperors over many years. One of the most special and famous Asian treasures is the "Jadeite Cabbage." This artwork, called "the Mona Lisa of Asia," is being shown in Europe for the first time.</p>
            <p>Vystrƒçil said, "In September 2020, I was lucky enough to see these unique items for the first time in Taipei. I am happy that some of them can now be shown in Prague." He believes that this rare exhibition at the National Museum of the Czech Republic will bring many visitors, including people from other countries.</p>
            <p>Vystrƒçil stated, "This exhibition is a wonderful example of how our cultural organizations can work together. It also proves that culture can cross continents and bring people closer."</p>

            <h1>Polish airspace invaded; France sends fighter jets to help and calls in Russian ambassador</h1>
            <p>On September 10th, several Russian drones flew into Polish airspace. The next day, France said it would send three Rafale fighter jets to help Poland protect its sky. On September 12th, France also called in the Russian ambassador to express its unhappiness.</p>
            <p>Poland, with help from its friends in NATO, shot down some of the drones. After this, they limited flights in the sky near the borders with Belarus and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>French TV channel TF1 reported that at least 21 Russian drones entered Polish airspace. Three were shot down. Most of the others flew for hundreds of kilometers before landing, perhaps because they ran out of fuel.</p>
            <p>The allied forces could not shoot down all the drones. However, the top NATO commander in Europe, Alexus Grynkewich, said that when planes defend against drone attacks, they must choose which targets to stop, depending on how many there are and where they are going. France agreed with this. A military source said that NATO's air defense systems shot down the drones that were "most dangerous."</p>
            <p>But some experts have different ideas. Pierre Servent, a defense expert for TF1 and LCI TV, said that drones are hard to stop. But he added that the drones still "flew 250 kilometers in Polish airspace," so the defense was not very successful.</p>
            <p>On September 11th, Poland used Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This means that if a country feels threatened, it can ask its allies for an urgent meeting.</p>
            <p>France quickly responded. President Emmanuel Macron wrote on social media that because Russian drones entered Polish airspace, he decided to send three Rafale fighter jets. These jets would help protect Poland and the eastern European sky with other NATO countries.</p>
            <p>Russia, however, said it was not involved. On September 12th, Russia and Belarus held their planned joint military exercise, "Zapad-2025."</p>
            <p>At the same time, the French Foreign Ministry called in the Russian ambassador. Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told France Inter radio that France showed that NATO and its friends are strong in defense and can stop attacks. He said Russia must stop trying to test and scare NATO countries.</p>
            <p>Barrot also said, "Whether it was on purpose or not, whether it was an accident or not, this is very serious and totally unacceptable. It is another one of President Vladimir Putin's many actions that cause problems."</p>
            <p>Other European countries also announced they would help Poland. Germany said it would continue protecting Polish airspace for three more months. It would also increase the number of Eurofighter jets it sends from two to four.</p>
            <p>The Netherlands decided to send two Patriot missile systems faster and set up air defense and anti-drone systems. The Czech Republic will send three Mi-17 helicopters. Poland said that the United Kingdom will also send Eurofighter jets.</p>

            <h1>Two boat accidents in northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo; at least 193 dead, many missing</h1>
            <p>According to officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo and state media today, two boat accidents happened this week in Equateur Province in the northwest. At least 193 people died, and many more are still missing.</p>
            <p>State media reported that the first accident happened on September 10th in the Basankusu area. A motorized boat turned over, and at least 86 people died. Most of them were students. Some people are still missing.</p>
            <p>State media reported from people at the scene that the main reasons for the accident were "too many people on board and traveling at night." Pictures from the area showed villagers gathered by the river, sad about those who died.</p>
            <p>The second accident happened on the evening of September 11th. It was about 150 kilometers from the first accident, near Malange village in the Lukolela area, on the Congo River. A large wooden boat carrying almost 500 passengers caught fire and then sank. The Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs said that 209 passengers were saved.</p>
            <p>It is still not clear why these two accidents happened. Also, it is not known if rescue operations are still happening.</p>
