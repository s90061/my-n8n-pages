https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/06/uk-households-still-cutting-back-as-inflation-eases-barometer-shows

A new survey shows that people in the UK are still being very careful with their money, even though prices are not rising as fast as before. Many families are still spending less on everyday items like groceries. The survey found that almost half of all people are using supermarket loyalty cards more often to get discounts. Also, a large number are buying more of the supermarket's own products instead of more expensive brands.

The main reasons for this careful spending are rising energy bills, higher transport costs, and more expensive house loan payments (mortgages). These costs make people worried about their finances. Because of this, people feel less hopeful about their personal financial situation compared to earlier in the year. This shows that despite inflation slowing down, the cost of living is still a big concern for many in their daily lives.

**Work: Is Hybrid Work Really Working for Companies?**

https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240502-is-hybrid-work-actually-working-for-companies

Hybrid work, where employees split their time between the office and working from home, is now a common way to work. However, companies are still trying to find the best way to make it successful. A recent report suggests that leaders need to focus on how to use their office spaces well and make sure that all employees feel included, whether they are in the office or at home.

One challenge is making sure everyone has fair opportunities, no matter where they work. Another is helping teams stay connected and work well together when they are not always in the same place. Despite these difficulties, many companies see benefits like better work-life balance for employees and a greater ability to keep good staff. The key is to create a fair and flexible system that works for both the company and its workers.

**Travel: Venice Starts Charging Day-Trippers an Entry Fee**

https://www.cnn.com/travel/venice-italy-day-tripper-fee-ticket-launch-2024/index.html

The famous city of Venice in Italy has started a new system to help manage the large number of tourists. From April 25th, people who visit Venice for just one day must pay an entry fee. This new rule applies during busy periods when the city expects many visitors. Tourists need to book and pay for their ticket online before they arrive.

The fee is five euros and helps Venice control how many people enter the city each day. The aim is to protect the city's unique beauty and special character from too many visitors. However, local residents do not have to pay the fee. This move is part of a bigger effort by popular tourist destinations around the world to deal with the challenges of overtourism.`;
