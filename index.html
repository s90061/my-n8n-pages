            <h1>Reuters: Beijing Asks Chinese Brokers to Stop RWA Tokenization in Hong Kong</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported, using information from two sources, that China's securities regulator has told some Chinese brokers to stop their "Real World Asset" (RWA) tokenization business in Hong Kong. This shows that Beijing is careful about the growing digital asset market outside of mainland China.</p>
            <p>RWA tokenization means changing traditional assets like stocks, bonds, funds, or even real estate into digital tokens. These tokens can then be traded on a blockchain. In recent months, many Chinese companies, including brokers, have started RWA tokenization in Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>According to people who know about the situation, at least two important Chinese brokers have received informal instructions from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in recent weeks. They were asked to stop their RWA business outside mainland China.</p>
            <p>One of the sources said that this new instruction is meant to better manage the risks of this new business. It also aims to make sure that the companies' advertisements are based on strong and legal business practices.</p>
            <p>In the past year, Hong Kong, an important financial center in Asia, has worked hard to become a digital asset hub. Many companies, including Chinese brokers, are getting ready to offer services like virtual asset trading, investment advice, and virtual asset management there.</p>
            <p>However, China, which used to be the biggest center for Bitcoin trading and mining, is now very careful about digital assets. This is especially true after 2021, when China stopped cryptocurrency trading and mining. They did this to keep their financial system stable.</p>
