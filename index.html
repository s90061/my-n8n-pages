OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company, has recently introduced its newest AI model, GPT-4o. This advanced technology aims to make interactions with AI much more natural and easy. The "o" in its name stands for "omni," meaning it can understand and create content in various forms, including text, audio, and images.

Users can now speak to ChatGPT, OpenAI's popular AI chatbot, and receive instant responses. The new model can interpret emotions in a user's voice and even reply with different emotional tones itself. For example, it can answer questions in real-time, translate languages during a conversation, or help solve math problems by listening to a user explain them. This makes the AI feel much more like talking to a human. OpenAI plans to make these advanced voice and video features available to all users, even those using the free version of ChatGPT, in the coming weeks. The company also announced a desktop app for ChatGPT, allowing users to easily access the AI from their computers. This development is a big step towards making AI more helpful and accessible in everyday life and work.

**New EU Law to Make Fashion Brands Pay for Textile Waste**

The European Union has recently agreed on a new law that will make fashion companies responsible for the entire life cycle of their products, especially when they become waste. This new rule aims to reduce the huge amount of textile waste that ends up in landfills or is burned, causing harm to the environment. Under the new law, companies that produce clothing, shoes, and other textiles will have to pay a fee for the waste their products create. This money will then be used to help collect, sort, and recycle used textiles.

This move is a direct response to the "fast fashion" trend, where clothes are made cheaply and often thrown away after only a few uses. This trend has led to a significant increase in textile waste, which uses a lot of resources and pollutes the planet. The EU hopes that by making producers pay, they will be encouraged to design more durable clothes, use more recycled materials, and improve recycling systems. The new law will begin to be put into practice by 2030, with different EU countries introducing it at slightly different times. This is a major step towards a more circular economy in the fashion industry, where resources are reused instead of wasted.

**Employees Still Resisting Full Return to Office, Survey Shows**

A recent survey has revealed that many employees are still not happy about returning to the office full-time, even as more companies ask their staff to come back. The survey found that most workers would prefer a hybrid work model, where they spend some days in the office and some days working from home. This preference shows that the way we work has changed significantly since the pandemic.

Employees cited several reasons for wanting to stay hybrid or fully remote. Many feel they are more productive when working from home because they have fewer distractions and more flexibility. They also appreciate the better work-life balance and the money they save on commuting costs, such as fuel and public transport. While companies often want employees back in the office to encourage teamwork and strengthen company culture, the survey suggests that forcing a full return can lead to unhappiness and even staff leaving. Companies are now looking for ways to balance their needs with employee preferences to create a work environment that keeps everyone productive and satisfied.`;
