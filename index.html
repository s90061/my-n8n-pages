WhatsApp, a very popular messaging app, is now testing a new AI chatbot. This chatbot uses Meta's latest AI technology, called Llama 3. For now, only some Android users in India can try it.

This new AI can do many things. It can answer your questions, create pictures for you, and help you with different tasks. You can chat directly with the AI in a private conversation. You can also bring the AI into group chats by typing "@Meta AI" and asking it something.

Meta, the company that owns WhatsApp, is also adding these AI features to its other apps, like Facebook and Instagram. The goal is to make it easier for people to get information and communicate in new ways through their daily apps.

**Tips for Visiting Europe's Popular Cities Without Crowds**

Many of Europe's most famous cities, like Paris, Rome, and Barcelona, are becoming very crowded with tourists. This "overtourism" can make it difficult for both visitors and local people. However, there are ways to enjoy these beautiful places without huge crowds.

One good tip is to travel during the "off-season." This means visiting in spring, autumn, or winter instead of the busy summer months. The weather might still be nice, and there will be fewer people.

Another idea is to choose less famous cities. For example, instead of Florence, you could visit Bologna in Italy, which is also beautiful and has great food. When in a big city, try to explore neighborhoods away from the main tourist spots.

Also, plan ahead: buy tickets for museums and attractions online, and try to visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Using public transport or walking can also help you avoid traffic and experience the city more like a local. By doing these things, you can have a more relaxing and enjoyable trip.
