OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company, recently showed its newest AI model called GPT-4o. The "o" stands for "omni," which means it can understand and create information in many forms, like voice, images, and text, all at the same time and very quickly. This new model is designed to make talking to AI feel more natural, almost like speaking to a person. It can understand emotions in your voice and even reply in different tones.

The company aims to make advanced AI more available to everyone. A big part of this new model will be free for all users, and paying customers will get even more powerful features. OpenAI hopes this will help more people and businesses use AI in their daily lives and work. For example, it could improve customer service, help with learning, or make digital assistants much smarter. This move also increases competition with other big tech companies working on similar AI technologies.

This development could change how we interact with computers and digital tools, making them much easier and more helpful for many different tasks.

**Earth Faces More Record-Breaking Heat as Temperatures Rise**

Our planet experienced its eleventh month in a row of record-breaking global temperatures in April 2024. Scientists from the Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that April was the warmest April ever recorded. This continues a worrying trend that shows global warming is getting faster. The last year, from May 2023 to April 2024, was also the hottest twelve-month period in history.

These high temperatures are mainly due to the greenhouse gases that humans release into the atmosphere, which trap heat. A natural weather pattern called El NiÃ±o, which warms parts of the Pacific Ocean, also added to the heat, though its effect is now fading. The continued warming means we can expect more extreme weather events, such as very hot heatwaves, long periods without rain, and severe floods.

These changes are already affecting daily life, farming, and health in many places around the world. Experts warn that urgent action is needed to cut emissions and slow down global warming.

**Venice Starts New Fee for Day Visitors**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, recently began a new system requiring day-trip visitors to pay a small fee to enter. Starting in late April 2024, tourists who visit for the day and do not stay overnight must pay â‚¬5 to enter the old city center during busy times. This trial program will run on specific dates when many tourists are expected.

The main goal of this new fee is to help manage the large number of visitors to Venice. Overtourism has caused many problems for the city, including crowded streets, damage to old buildings, and difficulties for local residents. City officials hope the fee will encourage fewer people to visit on the busiest days and help protect the cityâ€™s unique culture and environment.

Some people believe this is a good step towards making tourism more sustainable, while others are worried it might affect visitors' experiences or local businesses. It is an experimental plan to find a better balance between tourism and the quality of life for Venetians.`;
