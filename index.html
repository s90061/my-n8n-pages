            <h1>Trump Criticizes Democrats for Risking Government Shutdown, Threatens Many Layoffs</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., September 30) Leaders from both political parties in the US Congress met with President Trump and other important officials at the White House yesterday. But they could not agree on how to stop the government from shutting down. Today, President Trump, who is from the Republican Party, said that a government shutdown might happen. He blamed the Democratic Party because they want to give health insurance to people who are in the country illegally. He also said that if the government shuts down, many workers might lose their jobs.</p>
            <p>The government's budget will end today. US news reports say that the Republican and Democratic parties still disagree. They cannot pass a bill for money before the new financial year starts on October 1st. This means the federal government will shut down.</p>
            <p>The leaders of the Democratic Party in both the Senate and the House of Representatives said that there are still big differences between the two sides. They stated, "If the government shuts down, it will be because the Republican Party chose to stop it, and this will hurt the American people."</p>
            <p>However, President Donald Trump spoke to reporters at the White House today. He said, "We might have a government shutdown." He criticized the Democratic Party for wanting to give health insurance to people who are in the country illegally. He said this would only make more illegal immigrants come to the United States.</p>
            <p>The Republican Party wants to pass a simple temporary bill to give money to the government. This bill would keep the government funded for seven weeks at its current level, to stop a shutdown. But the Democratic Party wants to add parts to the bill. These parts would extend help for health insurance and other important social programs so they don't stop when their money runs out.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that the Democratic Party wants the government to shut down. He said, "We do not want the government to shut down." He added that a lot of money is being invested in the United States right now. He emphasized, "We are the people who want the government to shut down the least."</p>
            <p>He also warned that if the government shuts down, "we can do things that will hurt them, and they cannot change these things back." For example, he mentioned firing many workers and stopping programs that Democrats like. He said that the Democratic Party is taking a risk by letting the government shut down. But during a shutdown, he added, "we can take action in healthcare and other areas."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "We do not want fraud, waste, and misuse of money." He said the government has been working to reduce these problems. But, he argued, the Democratic Party wants people who are in the country illegally to come to the US and receive a lot of healthcare. He added that other people would have to pay for this.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post newspaper reported that President Trump's government already has a plan for a shutdown. This plan includes the Department of Labor stopping most of its work, and thousands of employees losing their jobs. National parks will close, and their workers might also be fired. The phone lines for the US tax office (IRS) will not be answered, and they might even stop working forever.</p>
            <p>However, in big cities like Washington D.C. and Memphis, soldiers from the National Guard will still be working. Actions like finding and sending away people who are in the country illegally will also continue. Police and other law enforcement officers will work without pay at first.</p>
            <p>US news reports say that the last time the US government shut down was during President Trump's first time in office. The main reason was issues about immigration. That shutdown lasted for 35 days, from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. It was the longest government shutdown in US history.</p>

            <h1>Worries About Rising Prices Make US Consumer Confidence Fall to Five-Month Low in September</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., September 30) New information shows that how confident US shoppers feel dropped in September. It is now the lowest it has been since President Trump put many taxes on imported goods in April. People who were asked questions said they are more worried about prices going up (inflation).</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that a group called the Conference Board shared some numbers. The Consumer Confidence Index for September was 94.2. This is 3.6 points lower than the corrected number for August, which was 97.8. It is also lower than what experts from Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal thought it would be.</p>
            <p>Stephanie Guichard, a main economist at the Conference Board, said that people who answered the survey wrote about prices and inflation more often in September. This shows that these two things are again the biggest worries for shoppers about the economy. She also said that people still care about the taxes on imported goods, but not as much as they did in August.</p>
            <p>Guichard pointed out that what shoppers expect for inflation over the next year went down a little. It was 6.1% in August and is now 5.8%. However, this is still higher than what it was at the end of last year.</p>
            <p>Since President Trump returned to the White House and started his policy of putting taxes on imported goods, prices in the US have slowly gone up. He put high taxes on goods from both friendly countries and those he saw as rivals. He did this to change how the US trades with other countries.</p>
            <p>Even with this, President Trump and his team of economic advisors keep saying that the rise in prices is not very big. They have also asked the US central bank (the Federal Reserve) to quickly lower interest rates. They believe this will help the economy.</p>

            <h1>Trump Wins First Drug Price Battle: Pfizer Agrees to Work With Government to Lower Medicine Prices</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., September 30) Today, President Trump of the United States announced that his government has made a deal with the company Pfizer. Pfizer has agreed to willingly lower the prices of its medicines. This is part of the government's plan to connect drug prices in the US to the lower prices found in other countries.</p>
            <p>According to news from CNBC, President Donald Trump stated that Pfizer will do several things to make medicine prices lower in the United States. One important step is selling its current medicines to people who get health help from the government (Medicaid, which is public insurance for people with low income) at the "most favored nation" price. This means they will sell the medicines at the lowest price that Pfizer offers in other rich countries. Also, any new medicines Pfizer makes in the future will have this same "most favored nation" price. This price will be for Medicare (public insurance for people over 65), Medicaid, and private health insurance companies.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Pfizer has agreed to give some of its most popular medicines to our customers at special prices, from half price to completely free." He also said that people will be able to buy these medicines directly online.</p>
            <p>Trump also shared that he is talking with other medicine companies about making similar deals. The Associated Press (AP) reported that this agreement is a result of President Trump asking 17 medicine companies to promise to lower their prices by September 29th. This request was officially sent to the big medicine companies in letters at the end of July.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump added that Pfizer will invest 70 billion US dollars. This money will be used to build new factories in the United States to make medicines.</p>
            <p>Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, was at the press conference. Today, Pfizer released a statement saying that they have indeed made a deal with President Trump about medicine prices.</p>
            <p>People who know about the deal told Angelica Peebles, a reporter for CNBC, that the agreement also means new taxes on imported medicines will be delayed for three years. This delay will happen as long as Pfizer keeps building medicine factories in the United States.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), after this news became public, the price of Pfizer's shares went up by 5% when the stock market opened today.</p>
            <p>In May this year, President Trump signed an official order. This order brought back a policy called "most favored nation," which some people disagreed with. He wanted to lower medicine prices in the US a lot. He planned to do this by connecting the prices of some medicines to the much lower prices in other countries.</p>
            <p>This agreement happened at a time when medicine companies were feeling pressure. This was because President Trump's government planned to put new taxes on medicines brought into the country.</p>
