Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how we work all around the world. It is making big changes to job roles and the skills people need. Many worry that AI will take away jobs, but experts say that AI will probably help people do their jobs better, rather than completely replace them.

Because of this change, people need to learn new skills. Workers should focus on becoming good with digital tools and improving their thinking skills. These are very important for working with AI. Companies are now spending more money on training their employees. They understand that if their workers are ready, they can use AI well and stay competitive in the market.

This means that many jobs will be different, not gone. For example, AI can handle repetitive tasks, letting people focus on more creative or complex work. Future success will depend on how well both employees and businesses can learn and adapt to these new technologies.

**Europe's Cities Get Ready for Hotter Summers**

Cities across Europe are feeling the effects of climate change more and more. They are experiencing hotter temperatures and more extreme weather, like heatwaves or heavy rain. To deal with this, city governments are starting many different plans to help people adapt.

Some of these plans include planting many more trees to create shade and green areas, which help cool the air. They are also using special materials on buildings and roads that reflect sunlight instead of absorbing it, making areas cooler. Another important step is to manage water better, for example, by collecting rainwater or improving drainage systems to prevent floods.

The main goal of these efforts is to protect people's health and keep cities pleasant to live in, even as the climate changes. These changes are becoming a normal part of daily life in many European cities.

**Venice Tries New Fee to Manage Tourists**

The famous city of Venice has started a new trial program. Now, day visitors who don't stay overnight must pay a small fee to enter the city. This is a big step to help manage the very large number of tourists, a problem known as "overtourism."

This new rule is meant to help protect the city's old buildings and streets, which are very delicate. It also aims to reduce crowded areas and make life better for the people who live in Venice. Residents have often said that too many tourists make it hard for them to live their daily lives.

This trial program will be watched carefully to see how well it works. Many other popular places around the world are also trying to find ways to deal with too many tourists. Venice's approach could offer important lessons for them on how to manage tourism in a more sustainable way.`;
