            <h1>Next Week: Warm and Sunny, Afternoon Rain in Central and Southern Mountains</h1>
            <p>The weather office said today that the coming week will be warm. It will be sunny to partly cloudy everywhere. There will be short thunderstorms in the afternoons. In the mountains of central and southern Taiwan, there might be heavy rain. On October 3rd and 4th, there will be more moisture in the air. This means short, sudden rain in Hualien, Taitung, and Hengchun Peninsula. The weather office thinks people will be able to see the moon around the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jun-yao, a weather forecaster, told the Central News Agency that the Pacific high-pressure system will cause stable weather next week. From tomorrow until October 2nd, most areas will be sunny to partly cloudy. In the afternoons, southern areas and other mountain regions will have short thunderstorms. The mountains in central and southern Taiwan might have heavy rain in the afternoons. Tomorrow morning, western Taiwan might have some scattered short showers because of sea and land winds meeting.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jun-yao explained that on October 3rd and 4th, a cloud system from the south will bring short, sudden rain or thunderstorms to Hualien, Taitung, and Hengchun Peninsula. Right now, the information does not show very strong rain. Other areas will be sunny to partly cloudy, with short thunderstorms in the afternoon in southern areas and other mountain regions.</p>
            <p>On October 5th and 6th, there will be less moisture. Most areas will be cloudy to sunny. Only Hengchun Peninsula will have short, sudden rain. In the afternoons, central and southern Taiwan and other mountain regions will have short thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jun-yao said that it will still be warm during the day everywhere next week. Temperatures will be about 31 to 34 degrees Celsius. In some parts of Taipei, central Taiwan, and southern Taiwan, it might be over 36 degrees.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jun-yao said that current information shows cold air to the north. However, the Pacific high-pressure system is strong, so the cold air has not yet reached south of 34 degrees North latitude. There is a low chance it will affect Taiwan next week. It might slowly move south after the Mid-Autumn Festival or around mid-October. It could possibly affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>However, Zhang Jun-yao also mentioned that a large low-pressure area east of the Philippines still has tropical weather forming. On October 3rd and 4th, a tropical disturbance might pass through the Philippines. This will indirectly cause a southern cloud system to move north and affect Taiwan. Another tropical system might form around the Mid-Autumn Festival. Experts are not sure yet if the northern cold air will affect Taiwan first or if the tropical systems east of the Philippines will. We need to wait and see.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Flood: Nearly 2,000 Homes Covered in Mud; County Government to Give NT$50,000 to Each Home, Starting October 3</h1>
            <p>The Mataiâ€™an Stream landslide dam caused a serious flood in Guangfu Township. Almost 2,000 homes were filled with mud. The Hualien County Government announced today that they hope to give 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) to each affected home by October 3rd at the earliest. This money will help the people affected by the disaster return to normal life.</p>
            <p>Hualien County Magistrate Hsu Chen-wei spoke at the forward command center today. She said that the county government is planning how to get the money. They expect to give each affected home 50,000 NTD. This includes 10,000 NTD for comfort and 40,000 NTD for aid. They hope to give out the money by October 3rd, if all the paperwork is done. This will help people buy things they need and get back to their lives quickly.</p>
            <p>It is now the 7th day after the disaster. Hsu Chen-wei said that clearing the mud and repairing homes is the most important task now. They are currently clearing ditches along the roads and fixing water and electricity. She thanked the cleaning teams, special search and rescue teams, heavy machinery, and all support staff from different cities and counties. She especially thanked the kind volunteers who helped with rescue efforts during the three-day holiday.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chen-wei stated that based on the current progress of street cleaning and water/electricity repairs, they will announce when Guangfu Township can go back to work and school once it is safe.</p>

            <h1>After Japan Visit, Han Kuo-yu Hopes Hualien Residents Recover</h1>
            <p>Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu returned to Taiwan today after his "Japan Parliamentary Diplomacy Visit Group" finished its trip. He said that friends and overseas Chinese in Japan are worried about the disaster in Hualien. He told the people of Hualien, "You are not alone." He hopes they can quickly recover from the flood disaster.</p>
            <p>On September 25th, Han Kuo-yu led a group of lawmakers from different political parties, called the "Taiwan-Japan Exchange Friendship Association," to Japan for parliamentary diplomacy. They visited the "Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council" in the Japanese Parliament and checked out the "2025 Osaka World Expo." The group finished their visit today and flew back to Taiwan this afternoon.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu spoke at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. He said that there were a few moving things during this trip to Japan. First, many friends and overseas Chinese in Japan asked about Hualien first. They showed their sadness and care for the Hualien disaster. Han Kuo-yu, his group, and all friends at home and abroad want to tell the people of Hualien, "You are not alone. Everyone at home and abroad cares about you." He hopes the people of Hualien can quickly get back on their feet after this flood.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu also used the word "amazing" to describe the Taiwan pavilion at the Osaka World Expo. He said that Taiwan had three small pavilions, and each visit was only 6 minutes for 40 people. But many people waited outside for 4 hours. This is because the Taiwan pavilions showed things that surprised all visitors. They showed not only the strong beauty of Taiwan's semiconductors but also the gentle beauty of Taiwan's butterflies, orchids, and old trees. More importantly, they showed Taiwan's value in the world's supply chain.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu pointed out that the exhibition carefully showed how Taiwan, known as the "semiconductor kingdom" and "wafer kingdom," affects people all over the world. Many people do not know that Taiwan's semiconductor supply makes life much easier. This includes mobile phones, refrigerators, TVs, motorcycles, MRTs, high-speed rail, and airplanes. Everyone, every day, in every corner of the world, lives with the convenience provided by Taiwan's semiconductors and wafers. He believes visitors to the Taiwan pavilion would be very impressed.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that the three political parties' lawmakers in the visiting group also met with leaders from different Japanese political parties, including four opposition party leaders and two former prime ministers. He said they gained a lot from these meetings. The "Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council" has nearly 300 members out of 700 Japanese lawmakers. The visiting group made the old friendship between this council and Taiwan's Legislative Yuan even stronger. This made everyone feel that the parliaments care about each other.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu used a Chinese saying, "Trees grow tall, but their leaves fall to their roots." He said that from Kanto to Kansai, Tokyo to Osaka, the visiting group once again felt the warmth and kindness of the overseas Chinese. Everyone wanted to treat them to meals, show their concern for Hualien, and said they would join Taiwan's National Day celebration on October 10th. Han Kuo-yu compared overseas Chinese to beautiful kites flying high in the sky, but their string is always connected to Taiwan's land. The visiting group is very thankful to the overseas Chinese.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu also used four phrases to describe this trip: "waking up earlier than chickens, running faster than horses, eating less than cats, and panting more than dogs." He said that even though it was hard, everyone was happy. The visiting group represented Taiwan's Legislative Yuan. They worked to help Taiwan overcome its difficulties in international diplomacy. The lawmakers from the three parties all felt they had an important job. He also asked the people of Taiwan to be friends with the whole world. This is a shared duty that the lawmakers from the three parties gave themselves. He hopes everyone continues to work hard for Taiwan's future and help Taiwan shine globally.</p>
            <p>The "Japan Parliamentary Diplomacy Visit Group" had 12 members. This included Han Kuo-yu, Hung Meng-kai (KMT) and Huang Shan-shan (TPP) who are vice-chairmen of the "Taiwan-Japan Exchange Friendship Association," and KMT lawmakers Hsu Yu-chen, Wang Hung-wei, Weng Hsiao-ling, and Lin Chien-chi. The DPP lawmakers were Ho Hsin-chun, Wang Mei-hui, Kuo Yu-ching, Chuang Jui-hsiung, and Chen Ying.</p>
