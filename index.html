            <h1>Taiwanese Men's Basketball Team Loses by 2 Points to Poland at Universiade, Misses Best Record in Team History</h1>
            <p>The Taiwanese men's basketball team played a game today for positions 9 to 12 at the Universiade in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany. Hsu Te-chi scored 17 points, which was the most on the team, and also had 5 assists. However, they still lost to Poland 87 to 89. This means they will not be able to beat their best record in team history.</p>
            <p>In the last Universiade in Chengdu, China, the Taiwanese men's basketball team finished 11th, which was their best result ever. This time, their captain You Ai-che, who plays overseas, led the team again. Other players from Taiwan's professional basketball league, like Lin Hsin-kuan and Chen Fan-po-yen, were also on the team. But in the group stage, they only won one game, so they could not get into the top 8. Luckily, yesterday they won strongly against India, which allowed the team to play in the games for positions 9 to 12.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwanese men's basketball team played directly against Poland. They wanted to win to play for 9th or 10th place and set a new best record for the team. They started the first quarter well, but in the second quarter, they did not make as many shots. So, the Taiwanese team was behind by 2 points at halftime.</p>
            <p>After halftime, the game was still very close. The Taiwanese team stayed very close in points. At the start of the fourth quarter, they scored 9 points to 3, and took the lead again. Even though Poland then caught up, Li Yun-chieh and Sung Hsin-hao made shots from far away just before the end of the game, which helped the Taiwanese team tie the score. This gave them a chance to play in overtime.</p>
            <p>However, when they were behind by 2 points, Hsu Te-chi took the last shot but did not score. Because of this, the Taiwanese men's basketball team lost closely to Poland. They will not achieve their best team record. Next, they will play against Latvia to try to get 11th place. If they lose that game, they will finish 12th in this Universiade.</p>
            <p>In this game, five players from the Taiwanese men's basketball team scored ten points or more. Hsu Te-chi scored the most with 17 points, and also had 5 assists and 2 steals. Also, the shooter Li Yun-chieh played for less than 12 minutes but scored 14 points very well, including 4 three-point shots. Captain You Ai-che showed his skills by getting 10 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals.</p>

            <h1>After US Increased Controls, UK Media Says $1 Billion Worth of NVIDIA Chips Still Went to China</h1>
            <p>The British newspaper "Financial Times" reported today that even after the United States made chip export controls stronger, at least 1 billion US dollars (about 29.3 billion New Taiwan dollars) worth of advanced artificial intelligence chips from NVIDIA still went to China within three months.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times report used sales contracts, company papers, and information from several people who knew about the situation. It said that high-end NVIDIA B200 processors, which are not allowed to be sold to China, are very common in China's growing black market for US chips.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA told Reuters that building data centers using smuggled products is not good from a technical or financial point of view. This is because NVIDIA only provides services and support for products that are officially allowed.</p>
            <p>Last week, NVIDIA said that the US President Donald Trump's government removed export controls on chips like the H20. This means NVIDIA is now allowed to continue selling these chips to China. These controls were put in place in April this year.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times report also said that within three months after the export controls started, Chinese sellers in Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces sold NVIDIA B200 processors, and other controlled processors like H100 and H200.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Commerce and the White House did not immediately reply to requests for comments. Reuters also could not check the Financial Times report on its own.</p>
