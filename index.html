            <h1>Indonesia: Riots Over High Salaries for Parliament Members, Finance Minister's Home Robbed</h1>
            <p>People in Indonesia are unhappy because of the country's economy and the high salaries of parliament members. This has caused protests against the government. The anger of the people is growing, and last night, the home of Indonesia's finance minister was robbed. Today, Indonesia's defense minister said they will take strong action against rioters and robbers.</p>
            <p>Protests started in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, on August 25. Protesters said that parliament members get too much money for salaries and housing. On August 28, the protests turned into riots after a police armored car hit and killed a motorcycle taxi driver. Some homes of political figures and government buildings were robbed or set on fire.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, a neighbor said that Indonesia's Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, had her home robbed early this morning. Her house is in South Tangerang, a city near Jakarta. Two groups of people robbed her home.</p>
            <p>The neighbor said: "The first group of robbers rode many motorcycles, with 2 or 3 people on each bike. The second group had about 150 people. They took televisions, sound systems, living room decorations, clothes, and dishes."</p>
            <p>Today, Indonesia's Defense Minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, warned in a press conference: "Law enforcement will not hesitate to act strongly against rioters and robbers who enter private places or government buildings."</p>
            <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto held a press conference today with leaders from different political parties. He said he has ordered the army and police to take strong action against rioters and robbers. He also warned that some actions during the recent protests across the country are "treason" and "terrorism."</p>
            <p>Prabowo also said: "Parliament leaders have promised to change some internal rules of the parliament. This includes changing the amount of money members receive and stopping trips abroad."</p>
            <p>The protests in Indonesia have continued for several days and have spread outside Jakarta. Several local parliament buildings were even set on fire. Because of this, President Prabowo cancelled his planned trip to China.</p>
            <p>President Prabowo has been in power since October last year. For almost a year, his government had almost no political problems. These protests are the biggest challenge he has faced so far.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Women's Volleyball Team Wins Second Place at East Asian Cup; Coach Touched by Players' Growth</h1>
            <p>In the East Asian Women's Volleyball Championship held in Hong Kong, the Taiwan team played against China in the final today. Taiwan lost with scores of 26-24, 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25, and won second place. The head coach, Deng Yen-min, said she was very touched to see how much the players have grown.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's volleyball team had won the East Asian Volleyball Championship three times before. However, they had not reached the top four for nine years. This time, setter Liao Yi-jen, also known as "Volleyball Sweetheart," led the team. Other players included Hung Chia-yao, Hsu Heng-yun, Weng Tzu-yun, Chien Yi-wen, and Chiu Shih-ching. Head coach Deng Yen-min, also called "Little Cow," said their goal was to reach the final. They wanted to end their last international game of the year in a good way.</p>
            <p>In the group stage, the Taiwan women's volleyball team beat Mongolia and host Hong Kong. They finished first in their group and returned to the top four. Yesterday, they also won against Korea 3-0. They successfully reached their goal of getting to the final. Sadly, today they faced a strong team from China. Taiwan scored first, but then China came back to win with scores of 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25. So, Taiwan did not win the championship cup.</p>
            <p>After the game, Head Coach Deng Yen-min spoke to the media. She said she used to play for the national team too. She knows that players feel a lot of pressure and want to win good results for Taiwan. So, she told everyone to focus only on the game and not to think about anything else. She wanted to create a "happy volleyball" atmosphere. This way, the players would naturally train hard and play with all their effort.</p>
            <p>From the Asian Cup and the Rhine-Ruhr Universiade to this East Asian Volleyball Championship, Deng Yen-min believes that these players have become less afraid of tall opponents after playing in these games. Their blocking, defensive positions, and attacking positions have also become much smoother. This made her feel very emotional. She also said, "I am thankful that the players were willing to trust the team in a short time and work hard together to achieve good results."</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's volleyball team is expected to start the second phase of training for the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games on September 8. Deng Yen-min said that more experienced senior players will join then, along with new players who have potential. Next year, there will be important events like the Asian Cup, East Asian Volleyball Championship, Asian Championship, and Asian Games. "Next year will be an exciting year, and I hope we can use this time to train hard," she said.</p>
