            <h1>Trump Opens New Golf Course in Scotland During Visit</h1>
            <p>Donald Trump, the President of the United States, opened his new golf course in Scotland, UK, on July 29. This event marked the end of his five-day trip. During his visit, he signed an important trade agreement with the European Union (EU). He also told Russia that they have less than two weeks to stop the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the large golf course is on the coast of Aberdeenshire. It has the biggest natural sand trap on a golf course in the world. There are also sand dunes and plants near the sea. Security people and golfers were seen moving around. They were waiting for Donald Trump to hit the first ball, with the sound of Scottish bagpipes playing.</p>
            <p>Before cutting the ribbon, Trump said, "We started with a beautiful piece of land, and we made it much more beautiful. This place... really welcomed us."</p>
            <p>Trump also added, "We will play (the opening game) very quickly. After that, I will go back to Washington. We will stop wars around the world. There are some conflicts in the world now, but we have stopped many of them. We will have a wonderful and peaceful world."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that this project would be very successful, and "people can come here and enjoy life."</p>
            <p>AFP pointed out that these words show how Trump's trip blurred the line between his job as president and his private business.</p>

            <h1>Are There New Rules for High-Dividend ETFs? Financial Body Says No, Just Guidelines</h1>
            <p>On July 29, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) in Taipei explained something important. Investors in Taiwan like investment products that pay high dividends. Recently, rumors spread online that the FSC had made new rules that might make high-dividend ETFs disappear from the market. But the FSC said today that they did not make any new rules. The Securities Investment Trust & Consulting Association (SITCA) simply collected ideas from companies in the industry and created guidelines. After the FSC approved them, the SITCA announced these "Guidelines for ETF Using Income Equalization Funds as Source of Income Distribution" in early July.</p>
            <p>Recently, posts online said that the FSC released the "Guidelines for ETF Using Income Equalization Funds as Source of Income Distribution" in July this year. These posts claimed the guidelines said that the actual dividend rate of ETFs should not be more than a set reference rate. This made people in the market worry that high-dividend ETFs would disappear.</p>
            <p>Gao Jing-ping, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said at a regular press conference that the "Guidelines for ETF Using Income Equalization Funds as Source of Income Distribution" discussed online are not new rules. She also said there is no issue of withdrawing any announcements.</p>
            <p>Gao Jing-ping explained that the FSC already set rules for using equalization funds in November 2023. This included when companies could start using income equalization funds to pay dividends. They released a letter about this on November 13, 2023. Since then, companies have had questions about how to follow these rules. So, the Securities Investment Trust & Consulting Association (SITCA) collected opinions from companies and created an example set of guidelines.</p>
            <p>Gao Jing-ping stated that after SITCA gave the guidelines, the FSC approved them. SITCA then posted these "Guidelines for ETF Using Income Equalization Funds as Source of Income Distribution" on its website in early July. The main purpose is to help companies follow the rules and understand the details of how to do it.</p>
