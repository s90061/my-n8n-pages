            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Is Coming: Kenting Beaches Are Closed, Beidawu Mountain Trail Is Not Open</h1>
            <p>The weather agency has issued a sea warning for Typhoon Wipha. It is expected to be closest to the Hengchun Peninsula tonight and tomorrow. Because of this, the Kenting National Park Management Office closed all Kenting beaches at noon today. People are not allowed to go to them. Also, the Beidawu Mountain trail will be closed from July 18 to July 20.</p>
            <p>According to the weather agency, at 2 PM today, the center of Typhoon Wipha was about 500 kilometers (about 310 miles) south-southeast of Eluanbi. It is moving northwest at 23 kilometers per hour (about 14 miles per hour). It will be closest to areas like the Hengchun Peninsula tonight and tomorrow. The waves at Nanwan Beach are getting bigger. They are expected to be 2.7 meters (about 9 feet) high by noon tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-shan, who is the deputy director of the Kenting National Park Management Office, told CNA reporters that all beaches were closed after the sea warning. He asked visitors not to go near the waves for their own safety.</p>
            <p>Kenting beaches are now closed, so visitors can only stand on the shore to look at the sea and take photos. A local person named Mr. Cai from Hengchun Township said that after noon today, it was cloudy in Kenting, even though it wasn't raining yet. He could feel that the typhoon was coming. He hopes it doesn't rain too much.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Pingtung Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency said that because of Typhoon Wipha, the Beidawu Mountain National Trail and the Huigu Mountain Cabin they manage will be closed from July 18 to July 20. If people had already booked to stay at the Huigu Mountain Cabin during this time, they will get all their money back.</p>

            <h1>QR Code on Recall Vote Notices Caused Problems; New Taipei Election Commission Says It Was Removed After Asking for Advice</h1>
            <p>The first recall vote for a lawmaker will happen on July 26. City councilor Chang Chia-ling said that yesterday, the New Taipei City Election Commission said the QR code on the voting notices was printed incorrectly. However, when she scanned it today, it worked correctly. The New Taipei City Election Commission replied that after asking the Central Election Commission, they needed to take out the QR Code.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Chang Chia-ling, a New Taipei City Council member from the Democratic Progressive Party, wrote on Facebook that the New Taipei City Election Commission had asked local government staff to remove all the voting notices that were printed incorrectly. These notices were then to be collected by the Election Commission.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chang told CNA reporters that the QR code on the voting notices was printed wrong. But because the notices had already been sent to the district offices, the staff had to quickly remove them so the New Taipei City Election Commission could get them back. She said this was a very big mistake in managing the election and wasted public money.</p>
            <p>Yesterday afternoon, the New Taipei City Election Commission sent a message saying that they found a mistake during the printing of the recall notices. They corrected it right away, and the delivery of the notices would still happen on time.</p>
            <p>Today, Ms. Chang posted again, saying that the New Taipei City Election Commission explained the mistake by saying that the QR code feature was not supposed to be used for this recall vote. The "mistake" was that the QR code incorrectly linked to the website for checking information for the 2024 presidential and legislative elections. However, when she scanned the QR code on the voting notices that were supposed to be destroyed, it actually linked correctly to the page for finding polling stations for this recall case.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chang asked, "Did the people of New Taipei City get the original voting notices that were supposed to be destroyed, or new ones that were printed again? If there was no mistake, why did they ask for them to be collected and destroyed? It caused a lot of trouble for all the local government staff!"</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Election Commission explained through a message that the Ministry of the Interior has two systems for looking up polling stations: one where you use your ID number and another where you use your household address. For this recall vote, the system that uses an ID number and its QR code feature was not allowed. After asking the Central Election Commission, they needed to remove that QR code, so they printed the notices again.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Election Commission said that all the notices and announcements for the New Taipei City lawmaker recall vote have been printed. District offices are now delivering them to homes. They will finish delivering all of them by July 22, as planned.</p>

            <h1>Joint Registration and Distribution for Four-Year Colleges and Two-Year Junior Colleges: Students Can Start Paying Individually From July 18</h1>
            <p>For the 2025 school year's joint registration and distribution to enter day programs at four-year colleges and two-year junior colleges, students can start paying their fees by themselves from 10 AM today (July 18) until July 23. They can pay at a bank, use an ATM, transfer money online, or pay at a convenience store.</p>
            <p>The Joint Entrance Committee for Technical and Vocational Colleges released a press statement today. It said that students who have been approved to register must pay their fees by the deadline. This year, 68 schools and 2317 departments are part of this program. They plan to offer about 18,473 places for students. The exact number of places will be announced on July 28.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that the last day to pay is different depending on how you pay. For example, if you pay at a bank counter, you must do it by 3:30 PM on July 23. If you pay at an ATM, you must do it by midnight on July 23. Paying at a convenience store has the earliest deadline, which is midnight on July 19.</p>
            <p>After you pay, you can check if your payment went through online after 2 hours. (If you pay at a convenience store, it will take 3 business days, not including holidays.) The Joint Entrance Committee reminds all students, whether they pay by themselves or as part of a group, to check their payment status during the payment period. For more information about dates and important things to know, please visit the admission website.</p>
