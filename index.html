            <h1>Trump Criticizes India for Buying Russian Oil, Says He Will Increase Tariffs; New Delhi Calls It Unfair</h1>
            <p>New Delhi, August 4 â€“ India's Ministry of External Affairs said today that it is "unfair and unreasonable" for the United States and the European Union to "target" India because it buys Russian oil. India will protect its own interests.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump has promised to increase taxes on Indian goods because New Delhi buys oil from Russia. However, Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs, released a statement saying, "Actions against India are unfair and unreasonable."</p>
            <p>The statement said, "Like any major economy, India will do everything necessary to protect its national interests and economic safety."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the Indian Foreign Ministry's statement did not give more details about these actions.</p>
            <p>After Russia attacked Ukraine, Russia lost its usual buyers in Europe. Since then, India has become a main buyer of Russian oil, giving Moscow a much-needed market for its exports.</p>
            <p>But India argued today that it "started to import from Russia because after the war began, the usual supplies were sent to Europe."</p>
            <p>India also said that Washington "actively encouraged India to import this kind of oil to make the global energy market more stable."</p>
            <p>India also said that the European Union and the United States have double standards when it comes to trading with Moscow.</p>
            <p>Jaiswal said, "The truth is that the countries criticizing India are the ones that allow themselves to trade with Russia."</p>
            <p>The statement also mentioned, "Trade between Europe and Russia includes not only energy but also fertilizers, minerals, chemicals, steel, and machines and transport equipment. As for the United States, it continues to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for electric vehicle industry, and also fertilizers and chemicals from Russia."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Trump wrote on his social media platform "Truth Social" that India is "buying a lot of Russian oil" and selling it for "huge profits."</p>
            <p>Trump also wrote, "Because of this, I will greatly increase the taxes India has to pay to the United States." But he did not say how high the new taxes would be.</p>
            <p>Currently, the US puts a 10% tax on goods from India. This tax is expected to increase to 25% on August 7.</p>
            <p>Last month, the European Union and the United Kingdom tried to put more pressure on Russia's economy to stop its attack on Ukraine. They did this by greatly lowering the maximum price for Russian oil exports.</p>
