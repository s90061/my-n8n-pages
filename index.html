            <h1>Heavy Rain Warning for 7 Areas, Severe Thunderstorms in Southern Taiwan</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration (CWA) announced heavy rain warnings for seven counties and cities, including Nantou County, this afternoon. Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County also have immediate severe thunderstorm warnings. People should be careful about flooding.</p>
            <p>The CWA said that strong rain clouds are forming in the afternoon. This means there will be heavy rain for short periods. Today, areas south of Chiayi, and the mountain areas of Nantou and Yunlin, might have local heavy rain. People should be aware of lightning and strong winds. In mountain areas, be careful of landslides, falling rocks, and rivers overflowing.</p>
            <p>The areas with heavy rain warnings are the mountain areas of Nantou County and Yunlin County, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, and Hengchun Peninsula.</p>
            <p>The CWA also sent immediate severe thunderstorm warnings for Pingtung County, Kaohsiung City, and Tainan City. The CWA stated that strong thunderstorms often come with thunder, lightning, and very heavy rain. There might also be strong winds or even hail. If heavy rain happens in the upper part of rivers, the water in the lower parts can rise quickly. Areas with poor drainage might flood. The strong rain can make outdoor activities dangerous and make it hard to see when driving. In mountain areas, landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides can happen easily.</p>

            <h1>TSMC Says It's Finding Many Solutions After Report of Removing Chinese Equipment from 2nm Plants</h1>
            <p>Nikkei Asia reported that TSMC has decided to remove equipment made in China from its newest 2-nanometer chip factories. TSMC said it does not comment on market rumors. It stressed that its plan for buying things globally uses a good system to manage risks and strong partnerships with suppliers. This helps them keep finding many different ways to get what they need.</p>
            <p>The report said that TSMC made this decision because of the US "CHIPS Act." Senator Mark Kelly suggested this law. It says that chip companies that get money or tax breaks from the US cannot buy equipment from "foreign entities of concern." Many Chinese suppliers are in this group.</p>
            <p>TSMC stated again that it does not talk about market rumors. It highlighted that its global buying plan uses a good risk management system and close relationships with its suppliers. It will continue to find many ways to get supplies and build a group of different suppliers worldwide.</p>
            <p>TSMC will start making 2-nanometer chips in the second half of this year. Besides preparing several 2-nanometer chip factories in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung science parks, TSMC's third factory in Arizona, USA, will also use 2-nanometer and A16 technology.</p>

            <h1>Chiu Tai-yuan Says Premier Cho Didn't Ask for Resignation, They Talked About Work Plans</h1>
            <p>News reports said that Minister of Health and Welfare, Chiu Tai-yuan, met with Premier Cho Jung-tai a few days ago but has not sent a letter to resign. Today, Cho Jung-tai said he did meet with Chiu Tai-yuan, but they talked about work plans. Chiu Tai-yuan stated that Cho Jung-tai did not ask him to write a resignation letter. They only discussed work plans and how the "Healthy Taiwan" program is going.</p>
            <p>Some news reports said that Chiu Tai-yuan, who has often been mentioned to leave his job, is "fighting to keep his position." The reports claimed that even though Premier Cho hinted that Chiu should write a resignation statement, Chiu refused in person. He also said that he believes he is good for the job.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan invited Premier Cho Jung-tai and other heads of government departments to attend a meeting. They presented a special report on "The progress, direction, principles of Taiwan-US tariff talks, and an assessment of the possible impact on Taiwan's industries." They also answered questions.</p>
            <p>During the question session, Kuomintang lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao mentioned that news reports said Premier Cho asked Chiu Tai-yuan to write a resignation letter, but Chiu refused. Lai then asked if Chiu Tai-yuan had met with Cho Jung-tai a few days before.</p>
            <p>Cho Jung-tai said yes, they met. He explained that when he met with Chiu Tai-yuan, the first thing he asked was if Chiu had long-term plans for his future work. Chiu Tai-yuan then explained a lot about his past and future work. Only the two of them were there, and no media was present.</p>
            <p>Chiu Tai-yuan said that Cho did not ask him to write a resignation letter. They both talked about work plans and the progress of the "Healthy Taiwan" initiative.</p>
