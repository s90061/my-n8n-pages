            <h1>Hualien Village Chief from China Loses Job, Taiwan Says No Double Citizenship</h1>
            <p>Deng Wan-hua, a village chief in Xuetian Village, Fuli Township, Hualien County, who came to Taiwan from mainland China, lost her job on August 1st. This happened because she still had Chinese citizenship, which is against Taiwan's laws. This is the first time a village chief has lost their job in Taiwan because of this issue.</p>
            <p>On the evening of August 13th, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a written statement that people chosen for public jobs cannot have citizenship from two countries. This is a rule that all citizens of the Republic of China (Taiwan) must follow.</p>
            <p>The MAC explained that the law does not allow public officials to be loyal to another country or government outside of the Republic of China. They said this is different from whether Taiwan accepts the People's Republic of China (mainland China) as a country or not.</p>
            <p>On August 13th, Zhu Feng-lian, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, spoke at a press conference. She said that Deng Wan-hua losing her job was "bullying people from mainland China" because of her citizenship. She also said, "The DPP government often treats mainland spouses badly," and "Their goal is to create fear and stop communication between Taiwan and mainland China."</p>
            <p>There is also a possibility that Li Zhen-xiu, another person from mainland China, might become a lawmaker for the Taiwan People's Party. Interior Minister Liu Shih-fang recently said that Li should give up any other foreign citizenship within one year of taking office. The minister also said, "The government of the Republic of China recognizes the People's Republic of China."</p>
            <p>Zhu Feng-lian stated today, "There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is a part of China. Taiwan has never been a country, and it will never be a country."</p>
            <p>The MAC replied, "We ask the Chinese Communist Party to face the fact that the Republic of China exists. We hope they will talk with us without any conditions to solve political differences."</p>

            <h1>Yang Zi-xuan Wins Women's Go Tournament Again After 3 Years</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's excellent female Go player, Yang Zi-xuan, won the final game of the Chian-Chiao Cup Women's Strongest Go Tournament today. She beat Lin Yi-ting and became the "Women's Strongest" champion again after three years. She said that staying confident was key, telling herself to stay calm even when the game was not going well.</p>
            <p>This is the 11th Chian-Chiao Cup Women's Strongest Go Tournament. It uses a double-elimination system, and the winner gets 500,000 New Taiwan Dollars. Yang Zi-xuan had beaten Lu Yu-hua, who was the champion before, in the winner's bracket final. Today, she played against Lin Yi-ting, who won the loser's bracket. Yang Zi-xuan, playing with black stones, took control of the game from the start. She also stopped her opponent's attacks well. In the end, she won by skillfully capturing a large group of her opponent's stones, which secured her the "Women's Strongest" title.</p>
            <p>Yang Zi-xuan won the Women's Strongest tournament again after her victory in 2022. She told Central News Agency that playing in China's Go League B and Korea's League helped her gain more experience. This also made her more confident. She feels that her mindset is more mature this year, and she can stay calm and think carefully during important moments. She said this "helped me play better in this tournament."</p>
            <p>Yang Zi-xuan said that staying confident was the most important thing for winning. She usually gets sad easily, so before the game, she told herself to stay calm and not get too nervous, even if the game was difficult or messy. She said, "I felt like the game today was not going very well for a long time, so I am very happy to win the championship. I feel completely relaxed now."</p>
            <p>Looking back at this Women's Strongest tournament, Yang Zi-xuan said the game against Lu Yu-hua was the most memorable. She said, "There was a big move in the end game that no one made, and when I made it, I won that game. Also, I had just lost to Lu Yu-hua in the selection for the Wu Qingyuan Cup before this, so winning against her now made me even more confident."</p>

            <h1>Mercedes-Benz CEO: China's Car Market is a 'Darwinian' Fight, Harmful to Car Companies</h1>
            <p>Ola KÃ¤llenius, the CEO of the German car company Mercedes-Benz, said in an interview with German media on August 11th that China's car market has very strong competition, like "survival of the fittest." He said that more than 100 car companies are involved, and the trend of lowering prices is hurting everyone taking part.</p>
            <p>German car companies like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Volkswagen have seen their income and profits drop a lot in the first half of this year.</p>
            <p>The German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on August 11th that KÃ¤llenius said Mercedes-Benz's lower profits are due to high tariffs in the US, the strong competition in China, and the long time it takes to switch to electric cars.</p>
            <p>According to the report, KÃ¤llenius talked about the intense competition in China's car market. He said that the trend of cutting prices in the Chinese car market is harming all car companies that are part of it. He described China's car market as having a fierce "Darwinian" competition, with over 100 car companies involved.</p>
            <p>KÃ¤llenius said that in the area of high-end cars, which is very important for Mercedes-Benz, Chinese people have not been very eager to buy them in recent years. This, along with the strong competition, has put a lot of pressure on Mercedes-Benz in China's car market. All companies involved are being affected. The Chinese call this "involute competition" or "involution."</p>
            <p>With many electric cars made in China becoming popular, Mercedes-Benz currently sells only about 1,000 electric cars per month in China. This is much lower than the sales a year ago. KÃ¤llenius said that unlike its rivals, Mercedes-Benz does not want to fight for market share in China at any cost. He believes that a pricing plan that offers big discounts to keep sales high is not the right way.</p>
            <p>However, the Chinese website Hexun.com recently reported that due to a weak economy and the popularity of electric cars, Mercedes-Benz car prices in China are falling greatly. Some cars are even being sold for half of their official suggested price.</p>
            <p>For example, a new entry-level Mercedes-Benz A-Class car was offered by a dealer for 125,600 Chinese Yuan (about 522,000 New Taiwan Dollars). This is half of the official lowest suggested price of 251,300 Yuan. A slightly larger C-Class car was offered for 182,800 Yuan by a dealer, which is 55% of the official lowest suggested price of 334,800 Yuan.</p>
            <p>As for Mercedes-Benz's electric cars, the EQA has an official suggested price of 322,000 Yuan, but some dealers offered it for 161,000 Yuan, which is also half price. Another electric car, the EQB, has an official suggested price of 352,000 to 428,000 Yuan, but some dealers offered it for 176,000 to 251,000 Yuan, also at half price. This has caused a lot of discussion in the market.</p>
