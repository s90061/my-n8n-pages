            <h1>Denmark says its airspace was attacked in a 'hybrid' way; unknown drones seen at its biggest military base</h1>
            <p>Danish police said today that unknown drones were seen again at night above their biggest military base. In recent days, many people in Denmark have seen drones. The authorities call this a "hybrid attack."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that these uninvited drones have caused many airports across Denmark, a country in the Scandinavia Peninsula, to close. This has been happening since September 22nd, when the mysterious drones first appeared in their airspace.</p>
            <p>A police officer on duty told AFP, "I can confirm that an event happened last night around 8:15 PM and lasted for several hours. We saw one or two drones flying over and around the Karup air force base."</p>
            <p>The police do not know where the drones came from. He said, "We did not shoot them down." The police are working with the military to find out more about these events.</p>
            <p>The Karup air force base shares a runway with a civilian airport. The airport was closed for a short time during the event. However, no commercial flights were taking off or landing at that time, so there was no impact on flights.</p>

            <h1>High temperatures in Northern Taiwan on the second day of Teacher's Day holiday; Central and Southern Taiwan should watch out for afternoon thunderstorms</h1>
            <p>Tomorrow is the second day of the Teacher's Day holiday. The Central Weather Administration said today that because of a high-pressure system over the Pacific Ocean, temperatures in Northern Taiwan (Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan) and areas near the mountains south of Taichung might be hotter than 36 degrees Celsius. Also, Central and Southern Taiwan and mountain areas might have afternoon thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Zeng Chao-cheng, a forecaster from the Central Weather Administration, told CNA that the weather will be mostly stable for the next week. Because of the Pacific high-pressure system, tomorrow's weather will be similar to today's. Most places will be cloudy with some sunny periods. There might be a little rain on the coast of Keelung, in the eastern part of Taiwan, and on the Hengchun Peninsula. Central and Southern Taiwan and mountain areas might have afternoon thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, Zeng Chao-cheng said that tomorrow's high temperatures will be about 32 to 35 degrees Celsius in most places. However, Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, and areas near the mountains south of Taichung might have local high temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Zeng Chao-cheng also said that after September 29th, the Pacific high-pressure system will get a little stronger. It will be sunny to cloudy everywhere, and the western part of Taiwan and mountain areas will have afternoon thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>For the weather from September 30th to October 3rd, Zeng Chao-cheng stated that it will be sunny to cloudy in most places. Southern Taiwan and mountain areas will have afternoon thunderstorms. On the morning of September 30th, there might be a few showers in western Taiwan, especially near the coast.</p>
            <p>Zeng Chao-cheng mentioned that on October 4th, a low-pressure system will pass south of Taiwan. This will bring a bit more moisture. Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have short, local showers. Other areas will be sunny to cloudy, and Southern Taiwan and mountain areas will have afternoon thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>About the two typhoons in the Pacific Ocean, Zeng Chao-cheng said that Typhoon Bualoy is moving towards Vietnam. Tropical Storm Racoon, which is east of Japan, is expected to keep moving northeast over the ocean. Both typhoons will not greatly affect Taiwan.</p>
