            <h1>a-We's charm sweeps Osaka, Cultural Expo opening sparks buying spree</h1>
            <p>The "We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka - Kansai Expo" started today in Osaka, Japan. The "Taiwan Spectrum" exhibition already had people waiting in line before it opened this morning. They were all eager to buy merchandise featuring the mascot a-We. Japanese people said they saw a-We on social media and fell in love with it, even thinking it was cuter than the Osaka Expo mascot, "Myaku-Myaku."</p>
            <p>"Taiwan Spectrum" is showing at VS. (at GRAND GREEN OSAKA), a modern art space designed by architect Tadao Ando. The first 50 visitors each day receive a special sticker. The Council for Cultural Affairs helped create the merchandise, which was very popular when sold in Taiwan. This popularity of a-We has now come to Osaka too.</p>
            <p>Wang Rou-han, who is from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and now works in Osaka, told Central News Agency that she lives in Kyoto. She left early this morning to get to the event and get a limited sticker. She started waiting in line an hour before the opening, but many Japanese people were already there.</p>
            <p>At 10 AM, people were allowed in and walked down the stairs into the exhibition area. However, when they saw the shop selling merchandise, the organized line broke apart, and everyone rushed to buy things.</p>
            <p>Many people wanted the a-We plush keychains, and most people bought at least one. Many also aimed for the a-We paperweight blind box. Socks and phone cases made and designed in Taiwan were also very popular. It has been very hot in Japan recently, so hats with a-We embroidery were also quite popular. Workers kept putting out more goods and were surprised by how many people came so early on the first day.</p>
            <p>Ms. Otomo, who lives in Osaka, caught everyone's eye with her "Myaku-Myaku" themed clothing. She said in an interview that she really likes Taiwan and has been to the Osaka Expo TECH WORLD hall many times. When the Cultural Expo released its mascot a-We, she immediately followed it on social media platform X and decided to come buy things on opening day.</p>
            <p>She bought an a-We doll keychain, socks, a blind box, and other items. She said a-We is very cute, even "cuter than Myaku-Myaku."</p>
            <p>Wang Rou-han and two friends from Taiwan who also live in Osaka waited in line together. They bought hats and happily put them on right away.</p>
            <p>She said she had been following information from the Council for Cultural Affairs online and was very happy to know about this exhibition. Living in Japan for a long time, she was glad for the chance to let Japanese people learn more about Taiwan. She was also happy to see so many Japanese friends waiting in line so early.</p>
            <p>Japanese visitors were also amazed by the exhibition. The "Colors of Taiwan" area showed works by older Taiwanese artists, letting visitors enter the world of artists like Chen Cheng-po, Liao Chi-chun, Lin Hsing-yueh, Kuo Hsueh-hu, Chen Chin, Lin Yu-shan, and Hsu Shen-chou. Many people spent a lot of time in this area, enjoying the large projected paintings. Many also took photos with their newly bought a-We dolls.</p>
            <p>The Council for Cultural Affairs said that hundreds of people came as soon as the shop opened, and people kept coming until noon. Over 100 blind boxes and a-We dolls were sold in the first 10 minutes, making them "must-buy items." The rare clear a-We, a hidden version, was especially popular, and badges also sold well. Since only cash was accepted, many Japanese visitors asked where the ATM was so they could get money and come back to pay.</p>
            <p>The "We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka - Kansai Expo" will run from August 2nd to August 20th. It will be held online and at physical locations in Osaka, Japan: VS. (at GRAND GREEN OSAKA), Osaka Central Public Hall, and Nakanoshima.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Language Exam Takes Place with 16,000 Test-Takers; Tainan Area Postponed Due to Work Suspension</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education's Taiwanese language test started today. A total of 16,548 people signed up to take the exam. Among the test-takers were a 5-year-old child and people from other countries, including South Korea. The exam in Tainan was postponed because the Tainan city government announced that people should not go to work or school today.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education shared in a press release today that the Taiwanese language test will be held today and tomorrow. It will take place in 18 different areas and at 74 schools across the country. Today's test is a computer-based test (Paper A), and tomorrow's test (Paper B) will be a normal paper and pencil test.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that due to heavy rain, the Directorate-General of Personnel Administration announced that Tainan City would stop work and school today. To keep people safe, the Ministry of Education also said that today's exam in Tainan would be moved to a different date. The new exam time will be announced later. Exams in other areas will continue as planned.</p>
            <p>This year, most people taking the Taiwanese language test are students, with 9,481 students in total. Among these students, 3,927 are between 13 and 15 years old (middle school age), which is about 41% of all student test-takers.</p>
            <p>A 5-year-old boy, whose name is not shared (Lu Xiao-di), is taking the Taiwanese language test this year with his mother and sister. He usually speaks Taiwanese at home. His whole family supports learning local languages. They often watch Taiwanese TV shows to practice.</p>
            <p>Xiao, a 19-year-old student with moderate cerebral palsy, has been interested in Taiwanese opera since he was small, so he became interested in Taiwanese language early on. By taking the Taiwanese language test, he hopes to use what he learns in traditional arts or to help keep the language alive one day.</p>
            <p>There are also test-takers from different countries for the Taiwanese language test. Mr. Lee, from South Korea, teaches Korean in Taiwan. He started learning Taiwanese 13 years ago and found that many sounds in Korean and Taiwanese are similar, which made him interested. He plans to study for a degree related to language in Taiwan in the future, so he signed up for the Taiwanese language test. He mainly learns Taiwanese by watching TV and movies.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that the test results are expected to be available online starting at 9 AM on October 13th. Score reports will also be sent out then. Certificates will be sent out starting on November 3rd. More information can be found on the Taiwanese Language Ability Test website.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rain Continues in Kaohsiung Mountains; 345 People Evacuated from Baolai Hot Spring Street</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain has been falling in the mountains of Kaohsiung for several days. Mayor Chen Chi-mai asked people to leave the Baolai Hot Spring Street area and go to safer, higher places. This is because there is a risk of a big landslide. The city's Civil Affairs Bureau said that 345 people have been moved. Out of these, 22 people are staying at the Baolai Hot Spring Villa, and 323 people are staying with relatives.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Government checked the weather forecast from the Central Weather Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. They believe it will keep raining in the mountains for the next few days. To keep residents safe, they have asked businesses and homes on Baolai Hot Spring Street to leave the area as a safety measure.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Mayor Chen Chi-mai spoke to the media about the forced evacuation of Baolai Hot Spring Street. He said that there is a risk of a large landslide near the hot spring street. Even though a yellow warning for mudslides has not been issued, he is worried that if a landslide happens at night, it could affect the Laonong River's path. The water might then overflow into the city and cause danger. Therefore, during typhoons or very heavy rain, the city government always asks people to move to higher ground. The water level has now gone down. If there is still a risk in the afternoon, people will be asked to move to higher places immediately.</p>
            <p>The Civil Affairs Bureau told the Central News Agency that as of this morning, a total of 345 people had left the Baolai Hot Spring Street area. Among them, 22 people are staying at the Baolai Hot Spring Villa, and 323 people are staying with family or friends.</p>
