            <h1>Civilian Groups Discuss Protecting Taiwan; Experts Point Out Key Areas</h1>
            <p>A civil defense forum was held today by the Formosa Republican Association. More than 20 groups from all over Taiwan that focus on civil defense, disaster readiness, and self-training joined. An expert named Chang Yu-min said that in a war, civil defense needs to plan ahead for four main things: who is in charge, how to share help and supplies, how to rescue people in damaged areas, and how to share information. This will help people protect themselves and others.</p>
            <p>The "2025 Formosa Republican Association Civil Defense Forum" was held in Taipei. The Taiwan Liberty Society also helped organize it. People from over 20 civil defense and disaster preparation groups joined in person or online. Some foreign experts also joined online. Experts like Liu Yu-hsi and Liu Wen from the Presidential Office's All-Society Defense Resilience Committee, Assistant Professor Chang Yu-min from the Central Police University, and retired Major General Yu Zong-ji spoke at the event.</p>
            <p>The Vice Minister of Interior Affairs, Ma Shi-yuan, could not come because he was helping with a disaster. He sent a written speech. In it, he said that disasters test not only how well we react but also how well we prepare. He used the recent Mataian landslide as an example. He said that running shelters, providing supplies, and getting medical help all show how much we have prepared.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-hsi explained that "war mobilization" and "whole-society defense resilience" are similar but not exactly the same. War mobilization means people have a duty to help the military. But whole-society defense resilience is about people choosing to help themselves and others, and keeping society working. So, if people are asked to protect their own homes and communities, more people will want to join.</p>
            <p>Chang Yu-min said that before a real fight, there will be information wars and psychological wars. Then, there could be blockades, missile attacks, and long-range rockets. Long-range rockets are not as accurate as missiles. They are also hard to find and stop, and they can cause a lot of damage to other things around. So, during a war, civil defense needs to think about these four situations for people to protect themselves: who is in charge, how to share help and supplies, how to rescue people in damaged areas, and how to share information.</p>
            <p>For these four situations, Chang Yu-min emphasized that if local leaders cannot do their jobs, people in the community need to create their <i>own</i> leadership system. They should not just wait for the old system. During natural disasters or war, different places will have different problems. Help and supplies need to be moved between different cities and counties. This means we should not only practice for one event or one area. For saving people in damaged areas, rescue teams need clear plans (SOPs) to stay safe if there is fighting. Military, police, firefighters, and civilian groups often use different radio systems and cannot talk to each other. They need to plan how to communicate, and they must practice this regularly.</p>
            <p>Yang Shun-lin, who leads the Taiwan Civil Society Association, gave advice to local civil defense groups. He said they should keep training, learn to tell friends from enemies, and report enemy activity to leaders. Second, they should learn "grey man skills" to stay safe. Third, they need to set up and practice ways to talk to each other within and between groups. He hopes the government will do more to teach people about national defense and military science. This could be done like how the Ministry of Culture promotes events, to help everyone understand war correctly and want to fight back.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng-cong from the Formosa Republican Association's Youth Civil Defense Joint Training Group said that sometimes, like in Hualien Guangfu, many volunteers arrive but do not know what to do. The forum helps local civil defense groups understand how to create their own systems and leadership during natural disasters or war when society is not working normally. This will help keep things running.</p>

            <h1>Asian Baseball Championship: South Korea Beats Japan, Taiwan and Japan to Play for the Title</h1>
            <p>On the second day of the Asian Baseball Championship's Super Round, the South Korea team won against Japan. This means that Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea each had two wins and one loss in this round. After checking the rules about tied scores, Taiwan and Japan will play against each other in the championship game tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team won all three games in the first round. So, they went to the Super Round as the best team in their group, with one win already. Yesterday, Taiwan lost to Japan 2-3. But today in the afternoon game, Taiwan won against China 4-0. This put Taiwan in a good position to reach the final.</p>
            <p>In the evening, there was a big game between Japan and South Korea. South Korea's starting pitcher, Hong Min-kyu, pitched for 6.2 innings. He threw 98 pitches. He only allowed Japan to hit 3 times and walk 3 times. He also got 2 strikeouts. He stopped the Japanese hitters very well. Then, Yang Jae-hoon came in to pitch for 2.1 innings and did not let Japan score any runs. Together, they stopped Japan from scoring at all.</p>
            <p>South Korea scored their only run in the first inning. Ryu Hyun-jun hit a double that brought a player home. In the end, South Korea won 1-0 against Japan.</p>
            <p>Because Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea all ended with two wins and one loss, their scores were very close. After comparing their "Team Quality Balance" (TQB), it was decided that Taiwan and Japan will play in the championship game. The two teams will play each other again.</p>
            <p>The championship game will be tomorrow evening at 6:30. Taiwan will be the home team, and Japan will be the away team. The game for third place will be between China and South Korea.</p>

            <h1>TPVL Lianzhuang Team Wins First Historic Match in Three Sets; Wu Zongxuan Happy to Score First Point</h1>
            <p>The first year of Taiwan's professional volleyball league, TPVL, has started. Today, the Taichung Lianzhuang team won their first game. They beat the Taipei East team with scores of 25-17, 25-18, and 25-20. Wu Zongxuan, who is called the "Golden Left Hand," was very happy because he scored the first point in the league's history.</p>
            <p>The TPVL, which is Taiwan's first professional volleyball league, was planned for almost a year. Today, the opening game of its first year finally happened at the Taipei East team's home court. The visiting Taichung Lianzhuang team played very well. Their foreign player, Voeurn Veasna, scored the most points with 19. Another foreign player, Khangal Tamiraa, scored 16 points, and Wu Zongxuan added 12 points. Because of this, Lianzhuang won the first historic TPVL game in three straight sets.</p>
            <p>After the game, Wu Zongxuan spoke to reporters. He said he was very excited to make history. His teammates even said they had never seen him shout like that before. He also said that the team had prepared for this game for a long time. From the beginning, they showed good teamwork and a strong spirit. This continued into the second and third sets, and they played better and better. He also thanked the other team for playing well, which helped them see what they needed to improve.</p>
            <p>Wu Zongxuan also shared that he worked a lot on his body during the time when there were no games. He joked that he was a bit nervous at the start of today's game. He used shouting to help himself feel less nervous. He thought the fans for the home team would be louder, but maybe it was the first game, and they were still getting used to it. He believes that after this first game, the fans will know how to react to visiting teams.</p>
            <p>Gao Wei-cheng, the captain of the East team, said he was very moved to see so many fans supporting volleyball in Taiwan. He said that as players, they must play well and try to win games to make the home fans happy. He said it was his first time playing in such a big event. When he walked around the court and waved to the fans, he saw how many people were there. He experienced many new things that he had never felt before.</p>
