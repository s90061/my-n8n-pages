            <h1>To Attract Talent, Examination Yuan Changes Rules to Increase Senior and Middle-Level Public Officials</h1>
            <p>The Examination Yuan (a government body in Taiwan) passed a new draft law today. This law aims to attract and keep good people in public service. It will lower the minimum number of junior staff that government offices must have. This will make more room for staff in higher positions. This way, government offices can hire more experienced people for middle and senior roles as needed.</p>
            <p>The Examination Yuan explained in a press release that these new rules set standards for how many people work in government offices. This includes job titles and the number of staff at different levels. This helps make sure that junior, mid-level, and senior staff are well-placed. The rules will be sent to the Executive Yuan soon for approval and then put into effect.</p>
            <p>The Examination Yuan said that society is changing. The way government workers are organized and how tasks are given has also changed. Government bodies under the Executive Yuan have mostly finished their organizational changes. To better fit how government offices work now, this change will mainly lower the number of junior staff. This will make more space for mid-level staff. It will help make government work stronger and help attract and keep talent.</p>
            <p>The Examination Yuan said there are three main points in this change. First, they will lower the standards and number of junior civil service positions (levels 1 to 5). Many basic tasks in government offices are now done by outside companies or by computers. Also, to give offices more freedom in hiring, they will slightly lower the required number of junior positions. They will also generally reduce the number of junior staff by 5%. For offices where work is very important for people's safety, like engineering, environmental, and social welfare offices, this number will be reduced even more. This will create more room for mid-level staff.</p>
            <p>Second, the Examination Yuan will allow more mid-level civil service positions (levels 6 to 9). This is because government work is becoming more specialized. To attract good talent, the number of positions at levels 6 and 7 will be slightly lowered by 5% to 15%. This will make more room for staff at levels 8 and 9.</p>
            <p>Third, the rules for senior civil service positions will be changed. This is to allow for senior advisors in central government agencies (third-level). New standards will be added for these positions. Also, to meet current needs, the rules for senior positions in central government agencies (second-level and third-level), and city and county governments will be adjusted. This will guide how senior positions are set up within these offices.</p>
            <p>The Examination Yuan stated that these changes are happening because government work is becoming more varied. The goal is to make the way government staff are organized better. It will give offices more freedom in using their staff. This will help all government tasks move forward smoothly. These changes should help government offices work better and make the public service more active and flexible.</p>

            <h1>Cho Jung-tai: Executive Yuan Warned About Fiscal Equalization Act Problems Long Ago, Legislature Should Fix Mistakes</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that the Fiscal Equalization Act was passed too quickly, and it has many mistakes. When the Executive Yuan asked the Legislative Yuan (parliament) to reconsider the law, they were given a chance to review it again, but they refused. This is a big problem for the country's money. If the Legislative Yuan, which is controlled by the KMT and TPP parties, thinks the calculation formulas are wrong and wants to change the law quickly, the Executive Yuan will be happy to see that happen.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho was interviewed by the FTV News program "Taiwan's Frontline," which aired tonight.</p>
            <p>Cho explained how the Fiscal Equalization Act was changed. He said it was voted on quickly in a very confusing situation. According to some lawmakers, there were 8 different versions of the law at the time. Many lawmakers at the scene were not sure which version was finally voted on.</p>
            <p>Cho said that the Ministry of Finance called local cities and counties last year to talk about changing the Fiscal Equalization Act. They narrowed down "more than 80 disagreements" to "about 10." But unfortunately, the discussions stopped when the law was forced to a vote.</p>
            <p>He said that the Fiscal Equalization Act was passed quickly and has many mistakes. Not only are the formulas for islands wrong, but the ranking and how money is given to different cities and counties are also wrong.</p>
            <p>Cho pointed out that the KMT and TPP versions of the Fiscal Equalization Act have a serious imbalance in how money is shared between central and local governments, and also among local governments. This means that areas in the north will get much more money. But islands like Chiayi, Kinmen, Penghu, and Lienchiang, as well as cities in central and southern Taiwan, will get much less money than they should. For example, Hsinchu City might get an increase of 259%, but Tainan only 54%, Kaohsiung only 51%, and Penghu only 14%. This is unfair.</p>
            <p>He said that the Executive Yuan later asked the Legislative Yuan to reconsider the law. When he gave his report to the Legislative Yuan, he pointed out all the mistakes and hoped they would review it again. But the Legislative Yuan said no to the reconsideration. He said, "You refused it back then, now you ask me to propose it again? I have no right to do that." Now, to fix this problem, the Legislative Yuan should think about the mistakes they made and take responsibility.</p>
            <p>Cho said that the Executive Yuan will never use "explanations" to hide wrong formulas. It will also not go against the law or break the national security system. If any clear law could be changed or removed by an administrative explanation, it would make the country's system very chaotic.</p>
            <p>The interviewer asked about Taichung City and Taipei City protesting that their funding for rail projects was cut. Cho said that the central government did not cut local funding. The total amount of money the central government will give to local cities and counties next year will be NT$1.165 trillion. This is NT$151.9 billion more than last year.</p>
            <p>When the interviewer asked if the KMT and TPP truly want to solve the problem, or if they are just blaming the central government and causing delays with political moves, Cho replied that he can only hope that the opposition parties show sincerity. He added, "If I say directly that they are playing games, they will immediately say that I am playing political games."</p>
            <p>Cho stressed that for the country's long-term stability, the newest version of the Fiscal Equalization Act should be discussed by everyone. It should be carefully discussed and changed when everyone agrees.</p>
            <p>Regarding the NT$34.5 billion in shared tax revenue that is currently stuck, he said that the Legislative Yuan, led by the KMT and TPP, must quickly make a decision on how to handle it. The Executive Yuan "will be happy to see it happen," and after that, they can think about ways for long-term stability.</p>
