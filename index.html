            <h1>Economy Ministry Promotes Rooftop Solar Power for Homes; 21 Cities and Counties Now Participating</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced on September 6th that it is working with local governments to speed up a plan to install solar panels on house rooftops. The Ministry stated that 21 cities and counties across Taiwan have joined this plan. They have also approved about NT$1.3 billion for the years 2025 and 2026. Currently, 11 cities and counties, including Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, Miaoli County, and Taichung City, have started accepting applications. People can apply now.</p>
            <p>To help Taiwan change its energy sources and make its power system stronger, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is working with local governments on the "Household Rooftop Solar Power Acceleration Plan." By working closely together, the central and local governments want to improve the subsidy system and application process. This will help renewable energy grow in different places and make the electricity system more stable.</p>
            <p>The Energy Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs explained in a press release today that 21 cities and counties across Taiwan are now part of this plan. This includes areas in the north, center, south, east, and on offshore islands. About NT$1.3 billion has been approved for this year and next year. This shows that local governments strongly support and are actively involved in the energy transformation plan. Each city and county is setting up their budgets, plans, and application systems.</p>
            <p>The Energy Administration said that as of September 1st, 11 cities and counties have officially started accepting applications. People should apply soon. Having solar panels on house rooftops not only helps keep homes cool but also lowers the temperature inside the top floor and reduces electricity bills.</p>
            <p>The Energy Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that other cities and counties are also preparing their budgets and getting ready to accept applications. This shows that local governments generally support and want to be part of the energy change. Besides money from the central government, 10 cities and counties also have their own extra subsidy plans. Among these, Kaohsiung City, Taipei City, and Changhua County have each added an extra NT$10 million for equipment.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs will continue to work closely with local governments to make the subsidies more attractive and easier to apply for. This incentive program applies to cases where equipment registration was completed after January 1st of this year. People who want to participate should apply as soon as possible.</p>

            <h1>Former Chairman of China's Securities Regulator, Yi Huiman, Under Investigation for Serious Wrongdoing</h1>
            <p>The website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission of China announced on September 6th that Yi Huiman, the deputy director of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Economic Committee, is being investigated. He is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law. Currently, he is undergoing a disciplinary review and supervision investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Yi Huiman was the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) for about five years. During his time, the number of listed companies greatly increased, but the performance of China's stock market was not good.</p>
            <p>According to reports from Chinese media such as First Financial and Blue Whale News, Yi Huiman became the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission on January 26, 2019, and left his position on February 7, 2024. During his five years in office, the total number of A-share companies increased by about 1,700. The Shanghai Composite Index rose from 2597.78 points to 2788.55 points, only increasing by about 190 points. During this time, the index fell below 3000 points about 20 times. Because the A-share market stayed around 3000 points for a long time, many people in the market were unhappy.</p>
            <p>During Yi Huiman's term, China's capital market made several reforms. On July 22, 2019, the STAR Market opened. On November 15, 2021, the Beijing Stock Exchange was launched. On February 17, 2023, a system of registration for all A-share initial public offerings (IPOs) was started. This led to a large increase in listed companies. From 2019 to 2023, the total amount of money raised from IPOs was more than 2 trillion yuan (about NT$8.5 trillion).</p>
            <p>Reuters reported on September 5th that Yi Huiman's push for the stock registration system also caused problems in the market. He was criticized for allowing companies to raise money through IPOs too easily, which weakened the stock market. He also let many bad companies become listed.</p>
            <p>On February 7, 2024, Yi Huiman was removed from his position, and Wu Qing, a former vice mayor of Shanghai, took over. The Chinese government did not explain why he was removed.</p>
            <p>After Wu Qing became the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, he made stock market rules stricter. He increased efforts to remove bad stocks from the market and made new stock listing rules tighter. As a result, the money raised from IPOs in China's stock market in the first quarter of last year dropped by 64%. The number of IPOs was cut by more than half.</p>
            <p>First Financial reported that in recent years, as the anti-corruption efforts in the securities system have continued, several people from the securities system have been investigated. These include Wang Jianjun, former vice chairman of the CSRC; Wang Huimin, former head of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission stationed at the CSRC; Yao Qian, former director of the CSRC Technology Supervision Department; Li Xiaoqiang, former deputy director of the CSRC Issuance Supervision Department; and Wu Guofang, former deputy director of the CSRC Legal Department.</p>
            <p>Public information shows that Yi Huiman, who is 61 years old, is from Cangnan, Wenzhou, Zhejiang. In 1984, he graduated from Zhejiang Finance and Banking School, which was a national key vocational school directly under the People's Bank of China at that time. In January 1985, Yi Huiman joined the Hangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). He worked at ICBC for 34 years, moving up from a basic position. In May 2013, he became the president of ICBC.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Woman Drives Into Store Accidentally, 2 People Hurt, 4 Motorcycles Damaged</h1>
            <p>A woman named Hong from Kaohsiung accidentally crashed her car into a Pxmart store in Fengshan yesterday. She hit two other women, Ms. Huang and Ms. Wang, while parking. Her car also hit the store's metal shelves and damaged four motorcycles. Ms. Huang and Ms. Wang were taken to the hospital and are okay. Ms. Hong did not have any alcohol in her system. The police are still working to find out exactly what caused the accident.</p>
            <p>A video was shared on the "Social News Video" online community. It showed an SUV crashing into a Pxmart store in Fengshan, but luckily, it did not go inside the building. The Fengshan Police Precinct of the Kaohsiung City Police Department stated this morning that 65-year-old Ms. Hong was driving her SUV to the Pxmart store on Haiyang 1st Road yesterday afternoon, close to 3 PM. While parking, she accidentally lost control and hit 77-year-old Ms. Huang and 52-year-old Ms. Wang, who were leaving the store after shopping. The two women had scrapes and bruises on their legs and other parts of their bodies. They were conscious and taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
            <p>After hitting the two women, Ms. Hong's car also scraped against four motorcycles and the store's metal shelves and other things. Luckily, the car stopped before hitting the store's glass, so it did not go inside and cause more damage. The police came to the scene and tested Ms. Hong for alcohol, and her result was zero. The exact reason for the accident is still being investigated.</p>
