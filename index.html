            <h1>Strong Economic Data Helps US Dollar, Wall Street Stocks Fall Again</h1>
            <p>New York, September 25 â€“ The main stock markets in Wall Street went down again today. This happened because new economic information from the United States was better than expected. This good news might make the Federal Reserve (Fed) wait longer to cut interest rates. At the same time, the US dollar became stronger.</p>
            <p>The US government announced today that the country's economy grew more than first thought in the second quarter. The growth rate, calculated yearly, was changed from 3.3% to 3.8%. This was mainly because people spent more money than expected.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 173.96 points, or 0.38%, ending at 45947.32 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index fell by 33.25 points, or 0.50%, closing at 6604.72 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index for technology stocks dropped by 113.16 points, or 0.50%, finishing at 22384.70 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went down by 12.32 points, or 0.20%, closing at 6284.67 points.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Stable as Russia Limits Fuel Exports, But US Economic Growth Affects Rate Cut Hopes</h1>
            <p>New York, September 25 â€“ Global oil prices stayed steady today. Yesterday, they reached their highest point in seven weeks. Russia will stop some fuel exports until the end of the year. However, the United States announced that its economy grew more in the second quarter than previously thought. This news made people less hopeful that interest rates would be cut again, which stopped oil prices from rising further.</p>
            <p>Brent crude oil futures went up by 11 cents, or 0.16%. They closed at $69.42 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures dropped slightly by 1 cent, or 0.02%. They closed at $64.98 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Secretary to Speak to High-Ranking Military Officers; Hundreds Called to Attend</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 25 â€“ The US Department of Defense said today that Secretary Pete Hegseth will speak to important American military officers early next week. Before this, American news reported that Hegseth had given a very unusual order. He asked hundreds of high-ranking US military staff, both in the US and other countries, to come to this talk.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that Hegseth has told all military officers who are generals (one-star or higher) and their most senior advisors to come to the Quantico military base in Virginia on September 30.</p>
            <p>The report also quoted someone who said, "Everyone is worried, and they don't know what this means."</p>
            <p>CNN also reported, using information from US officials, that the Pentagon has asked hundreds of generals to come to this meeting.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) asked the US Department of Defense about The Washington Post's report. Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, only said in a statement that Hegseth "will speak to senior US military leaders early next week." He did not give more information or details.</p>
            <p>In May, Hegseth ordered a big reduction in the number of active generals in the US military. It is not clear yet if next week's meeting is about this.</p>
