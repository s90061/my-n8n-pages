            <h1>"Weapons" is Number One at North American Box Office Again; "Jaws" Digital Version is Second</h1>
            <p>Today's estimates show that the horror movie "Weapons" is back at the top of the North American box office. It made 12.4 million US dollars during its fourth week, which was a long weekend for Labor Day.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, "Weapons" was in second place last week, beaten by the Netflix cartoon "Kpop Demon Hunters." Exhibitor Relations, a group that tracks box office numbers in North America, said that the horror movie, starring Julia Garner and Josh Brolin, has now made 134.6 million US dollars in total in the US and Canada.</p>
            <p>In second place was the 50th-anniversary digital re-release of the old thriller "Jaws." It made 9.8 million US dollars over the four-day long weekend.</p>
            <p>David A. Gross, a film expert from Franchise Entertainment Research, said, "It's really impressive that this movie can still do so well 50 years after it first came out."</p>
            <p>The crime movie "Caught Stealing," starring Austin Butler and Zoe Kravitz, opened in third place with 9.5 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Disney's "Freakier Friday" was in fourth place, making 8.3 million US dollars.</p>

            <h1>Baseball Player Liu Hsiang-pin, Who Played in Korea, Joins Taiwan Life Dragons; Tseng Chuan-sheng and Lai Po-chun Go Back to Amateur Teams</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 1 (CNA) â€“ There are some interesting names on the list of players applying to return to amateur baseball in Taiwan. Liu Hsiang-pin, an infielder who played in the Korean professional league, has asked to join the Taichung Taiwan Life Dragons team. Also, Tseng Chuan-sheng, a retired player from Taiwan's professional league, will join the New Taipei Caesar team. Lai Po-chun will play for the All-Out Sports baseball team.</p>
            <p>Liu Hsiang-pin's parents are Taiwanese people who live in Korea. He was born, studied, and played baseball in Korea. He also came to Taiwan for training during high school. He was originally a citizen of Taiwan but became a Korean citizen in his third year of high school. After that, he joined the Hanwha Eagles team as a training player. In 2022, he became a full player. He was released from the team after the 2023 season.</p>
            <p>Tseng Chuan-sheng, an infielder who used to play for the Wei Chuan Dragons, was fired from his team because he was involved in a Texas Hold'em poker issue. He has asked to go back to amateur baseball and join the New Taipei Caesar team. Lai Po-chun, an infielder, was chosen by the Fubon Guardians in the 2022 draft but never played in the top league. He was released after last season and will now join the All-Out Sports baseball team as an amateur player.</p>
            <p>The rules for professional baseball players returning to amateur teams have changed many times. Starting this year, players who want to return must apply by a certain date. If their application is approved and they finish the registration process for games, they can play in games organized by the Baseball Association. After these players' applications are approved, they can play in the Popcorn Baseball League, which is expected to start in November.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Sports Elite Awards Now Taking Entries; Nominees to be Announced in November</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 1 (CNA) â€“ The Sports Administration of the Ministry of Education announced today that the 2025 Sports Elite Awards are now open for entries. The deadline to send in entries is October 3. The list of nominees will be announced in November. This year's event is the first one since the Ministry of Sport was officially created.</p>
            <p>The Sports Elite Awards started in 1999 and are now in their 27th year. This is a big yearly event for sports in Taiwan, often called Taiwan's "Oscars of Sports." There are eight awards: Best Male Athlete, Best Female Athlete, Best Coach, Best Sports Team, Best New Athlete, Best Sportsmanship, Special Award, and Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
            <p>Today, the Sports Administration announced the rules for the awards and how to recommend people. Any organization can recommend someone if they meet the rules for a certain award in the "Sports Elite Awards Regulations." This includes central government offices, local governments (cities and counties) and their departments, national sports groups, city and county sports associations, schools, and media companies.</p>
            <p>The Sports Administration stated that for all awards except the Lifetime Achievement Award, the achievements considered must be from October 1, 2024, to September 30, 2025. The deadline for sending in recommendations is October 3, 2025. The date on the postmark will be used. The nominees will be announced in November, and the awards ceremony will be held in the afternoon on December 24.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that this year's Sports Elite Awards are the first to be held after the Ministry of Sport was formed. Last year, Lee Yang won the "Best Sports Team Award" for the second time with his partner Wang Chi-Lin. At that time, he joked, "I hope next time at the Elite Awards, I can be the one giving out the awards." Now, Lee Yang has become the first Minister of Sport, so his wish might come true.</p>
