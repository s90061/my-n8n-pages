Google is changing its search engine by adding new features powered by artificial intelligence (AI). These "AI Overviews" will appear at the top of search results, giving users quick summaries of information without needing to click on many different websites. The goal is to make finding information faster and easier for everyone, from looking up recipes to researching complex topics.

This change means that instead of seeing a long list of links, users might first see a short paragraph answering their question directly. Google hopes this will save time and improve the search experience. However, some people are discussing how accurate these AI summaries will be and what this means for the websites that used to get clicks from search results. This new approach could change how we use the internet every day.

**Cities Around the World Are Fighting Back Against Extreme Heat**

Many cities are getting much hotter because of climate change, especially during summer months. This extreme heat can be dangerous for people's health and puts a lot of strain on energy systems as everyone uses air conditioning. To deal with this problem, cities globally are starting new projects to make their streets and buildings cooler.

These efforts include planting many more trees to create shade and cool the air. They are also building more green spaces like parks and gardens within city areas. Some cities are even using special paints and materials on roofs and roads that reflect the sun's heat instead of absorbing it. These ideas aim to lower city temperatures, make daily life more comfortable, and protect residents' health as the planet continues to warm.

**The Rise of "Workations": Mixing Work and Travel**

The way people work has changed a lot recently, especially after the pandemic. More companies now allow their employees to work remotely, which means people don't always need to be in an office. This new freedom has led to a growing trend called "workations," where people combine their work with a holiday trip.

Instead of taking a full vacation, many individuals are choosing to work from a different city or even a foreign country for a few weeks. They might spend their mornings working from a cafÃ© or rented apartment and then explore the area in the afternoons and evenings. This allows them to experience new places and enjoy better work-life balance without using up all their holiday leave. It's a new way of living and working that is becoming more popular around the world.`;
