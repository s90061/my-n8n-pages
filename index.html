            <h1>Typhoon Willow Stops 129 Shipping Trips on 14 Routes on August 13</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow is coming. The Maritime and Port Bureau said that today, 14 shipping routes and a total of 129 trips are stopped. The affected routes include Donggang-Xiaoliuqiu and Budai-Magong. The bureau asks people not to travel to islands during the typhoon. This is to avoid getting stuck on the islands if boats stop running.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration continues to warn about Typhoon Willow on both sea and land. They expect Willow to land near Taitung around noon today.</p>
            <p>Because the typhoon is affecting sea travel, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Maritime and Port Bureau said that 14 routes and 129 trips are stopped today.</p>
            <p>The routes that are stopped include: Keelung-Matsu, Nangan Fuao-Fuzhou Langqi, Beigan Baisha-Fuzhou Huangqi, Kinmen-Shijing, Kinmen-Wutong, Kaohsiung-Magong, Budai-Magong, Magong-Wangan-Qimei, Jiangjun-Dongji, Donggang-Xiaoliuqiu, Yanpu-Xiaoliuqiu, Fugang-Green Island, Fugang-Lanyu, and Houbihu-Lanyu.

            <h1>Police Officer Found Not Guilty After Shooting Car and Killing Passenger; Victim's Aunt Charged with Threatening Judge</h1>
            <p>A police officer shot at a car that did not stop when asked. He accidentally killed a passenger, but a judge said he was not guilty. The dead person's aunt, Ms. Zhong, was very unhappy with this decision. She called a High Court judge, Mr. Lin, and said she would "kill" him. She also tried to make him open the case again. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office has now charged Ms. Zhong with forcing a public official to act and threatening safety.</p>
            <p>On the night of March 10, 2022, Officer Zhang Boyong was on patrol in New Taipei City. He saw a Mercedes-Benz car with a fake license plate and told the driver to stop. The driver, Mr. Lin, drove away fast. Officer Zhang chased him. When Mr. Lin's car got stuck in traffic, Officer Zhang shot three times at the back of the car. One shot accidentally hit Mr. Zhong, who was sitting in the back, in the head. Mr. Zhong died later in the hospital. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office later charged Officer Zhang Boyong with causing death by accident.</p>
            <p>The first trial was at the New Taipei District Court. The court decided that Officer Zhang Boyong used his police gun because it was an emergency. They also said that shooting the car was not too much. So, they found him not guilty. The second trial at the Taiwan High Court agreed with the first decision. The highest court also said no to more appeals, so Officer Zhang Boyong is officially not guilty.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office said in its charges that Ms. Zhong, the dead Mr. Zhong's aunt, was upset that Officer Zhang Boyong was found not guilty. On the afternoon of November 15, 2024, she called the High Court. She told the clerk who answered the phone, "I have found bad people and bought guns. The person I want to kill most is Judge Lin. I don't even want to kill the police officer who shot the gun the most." She also said, "I have seen a doctor, I have a medical report, so if I kill someone, will I not be put to death?" And she added, "If Judge Lin says he made a mistake and starts the case again, I can forgive him."</p>
            <p>The prosecutors think that Ms. Zhong's words were a threat to Judge Lin's life and body. These words could make him afraid. She used these threats to try and make him start the case again. Because of this, she is charged with forcing a public official to act and threatening safety under the law. The more serious charge of forcing a public official to act will be used.</p>
