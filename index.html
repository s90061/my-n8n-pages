            <h1>Kaohsiung mountain areas damaged, Chen Chi-mai estimates 1 billion needed for repairs, hopes to speed up reconstruction</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain for several days in the mountain areas of Kaohsiung caused many roads to collapse and disappear. Mayor Chen Chi-mai said that about 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars will be needed for future repairs after this disaster. He hopes that all political parties in the Legislative Yuan will understand the need for quick help, put the needs of the affected people first, and make reconstruction faster.</p>
            <p>This morning, Chen Chi-mai went with Premier Cho Jung-tai to Liouguei District. They checked on the repair of Baolai No. 2 Bridge Road and the search for a car that fell at the 81k mark of Provincial Highway 20. Chen Chi-mai told the media at the Baolai branch of the Kaohsiung City Fire Department that this heavy rain caused serious damage to farm roads and forest roads. Also, work is needed to fix mountain streams, areas where mudslides might happen, and areas where large landslides might happen. The total cost will be about 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars. He hopes the central government will help speed up rebuilding the damaged areas.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai explained that 3,143 people have been moved to safety in Kaohsiung so far. On Provincial Highway 20, between Baolai and Taoyuan District, about 10 places have collapsed, and the ground underneath is very exposed. Also, the Talalalufo Bridge has changed shape. They will first check how safe it is. He hopes the central government will give special money for rebuilding roads, bridges, and other things.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai said that nearly 3,000 residents in Taoyuan District use the Southern Cross-Island Highway as their main road. This heavy rain caused very bad damage. He hopes that Provincial Highway 20 can be opened again quickly. Also, Provincial Highway 29 has often had collapses and falling rocks during typhoons and heavy rains. The Minsheng Bridge was planned to be rebuilt between 2027 and 2028. He hopes this work can start right after the disaster to make sure traffic is smooth for residents in Namasia and Taoyuan District.</p>
            <p>In addition, Chen Chi-mai suggested that the rules for mudslide and large landslide areas should be made stricter. Many mudslides and landslides happened in areas not marked as dangerous. He hopes the Ministry of Agriculture will make standards stricter and mark and watch areas that could be risky to keep residents safe. He also hopes that the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau will re-evaluate and include more areas for protection based on the flooded or mudslide alert areas in Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung from this event, to prevent more disasters.</p>
            <p>For daily needs, Chen Chi-mai told the Agriculture Bureau to work with local farmers' associations. They should send an extra 500 kilograms of pork, fresh fruits, and vegetables to each area. They should send these supplies to the local villages as soon as the rain stops a little. He also told citizens that parts of Provincial Highway 20 have collapsed, and these sections can only be used with care. People cannot use these roads unless they are going to the hospital, helping with the disaster, or delivering important supplies. If people need to transport supplies, they can use the Baolai Fire Station as a base, and the Taoyuan Township Office will deliver them safely.</p>

            <h1>Oasis reunion tour, tragedy strikes: fan falls to death at London concert</h1>
            <p>London police in the UK said today that a man in his 40s died last night. He fell from a high place at Wembley Stadium in London while at an Oasis concert.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that this famous British rock band, Oasis, is on their first world tour after many years apart. The brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, who are in the band, told the BBC that they are very "shocked and sad" about the news of the fan's death.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the London Metropolitan Police said that they received a call around 10 PM last night. The report said that "someone was seriously hurt" in the crowded stadium. Police and medical workers quickly arrived at the scene.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson said the man was in his 40s. He had clear injuries from falling and was pronounced dead at the scene. The police are asking anyone who saw what happened to contact them.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Wembley Stadium also sent their sadness to the family of the dead person. But they said that the Oasis concert tonight will still happen.</p>
            <p>Oasis broke up because the Gallagher brothers had problems for many years. This time, they came back together after 16 years. They are doing a 41-show world tour, and tonight is the last show in London.</p>
            <p>About 900,000 tickets have been sold for the tour so far. Next, they will play in Edinburgh. Then, they will go to countries like the United States, Japan, Australia, and Brazil to perform.</p>
