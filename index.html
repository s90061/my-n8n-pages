            <h1>Thailand and Cambodia Fight for Two Days; Cambodia Asks for Immediate Stop</h1>
            <p>(New York, United Nations Headquarters, July 25, news from different sources) After two days of fighting with Thailand, which caused deaths and injuries, Cambodia's ambassador to the United Nations said today that Cambodia wants an "immediate ceasefire." Thailand also said it is ready to talk.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the long-time border problem between Thailand and Cambodia became much worse on July 24. Both sides used warplanes, artillery, tanks, and soldiers on the ground. This made the UN Security Council hold an urgent meeting about the problem today.</p>
            <p>Cambodia's ambassador to the UN, Chhea Keo, spoke after a private Security Council meeting where both Cambodia and Thailand were present. He said, "Cambodia asks for an immediate ceasefire without any conditions. At the same time, we ask for a peaceful way to solve the problem."</p>
            <p>Thailand's Ministry of Health said that over 138,000 people have left the border areas. They also reported that 15 people died (14 were regular people, and 1 was a soldier). Also, 46 people were hurt, including 15 soldiers.</p>
            <p>The Thai army said that at 4 AM local time on July 25, both sides fought again in three areas. Cambodia used heavy weapons, field artillery, and BM-21 multiple rocket systems. The Thai army responded with "suitable force."</p>
            <p>Nikorndej Balankura, a spokesperson for Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told AFP that the fighting seemed to slow down by the afternoon of July 25. He also said that Thailand is open to talking, and Malaysia might help them find a solution.</p>
            <p>He said, "If Cambodia wants to solve the problem through diplomacy, talks between the two countries, or even with Malaysia's help, we are ready. But we have not heard back from Cambodia yet." Nikorndej said this to AFP before the urgent Security Council meeting.</p>
            <p>Malaysia is currently the leader of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). Both Thailand and Cambodia are members of ASEAN.</p>

            <h1>Trump Arrives in Scotland to Meet UK and EU Leaders</h1>
            <p>(Washington, July 25, reported by Hou Tzu-ying, CNA special correspondent) US President Donald Trump arrived in Scotland today for a visit. He will meet with leaders from the UK and the European Union. Trump said that on July 27, he will meet with EU representatives to see if they can make a trade deal. He said there might be up to 20 different issues they need to agree on.</p>
            <p>Trump will visit Scotland from today until July 29. He will go to Turnberry and Aberdeen. He is expected to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Before leaving today, Trump told reporters at the White House that he would meet Starmer to talk about the trade deal they made before. However, after arriving in Scotland, he said that since the deal is already done, "we will have meetings about issues outside of the deal."</p>
            <p>Also, when Trump was interviewed by the media in Scotland, he said that on July 27, he will meet with EU representatives "to see if we can reach an agreement." He added, "Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, will come here, and we are looking forward to it."</p>
            <p>He also said that there is about a 50/50 chance of reaching a deal with the EU. The difficult points might be about up to 20 different topics.</p>
            <p>Earlier, von der Leyen posted on social media platform X, saying: "After a good talk with the US President, we agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday. We will discuss the trade relationship between Europe and America and how to keep it strong."</p>
            <p>Recently, the Financial Times, a UK newspaper, reported, citing sources, that the EU and the US are close to making a trade deal. This deal would put a 15% tax on goods coming into Europe, similar to the deal Trump made with Japan this week.</p>
            <p>In early April, Trump started equal import taxes on "Liberation Day." Earlier this month, he signed an order to pause these taxes until August 1. This gives countries more time to talk with the US. But at the same time, he also sent letters about taxes to over 20 trade partners, including the EU. He said that starting August 1, there could be a 30% tax on EU goods imported into the US.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Drop as US Trade Deal Talks Remain Unclear</h1>
            <p>(New York, July 25, news from different sources) Oil prices went down today. This happened because the US dollar became stronger, and people who invest lost trust that the US would make trade deals with important partners before next week's deadline.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September went down by 1.3%. It ended the day at $65.16 per barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price for North Sea Brent crude oil for September went down by 1.1%. It ended the day at $68.44 per barrel.</p>
