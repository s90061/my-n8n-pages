New research shows that teenagers in the UK spend a lot of time on social media. On average, young people aged 12 to 17 use social media for almost five hours every day. This information comes from Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator.

The study found that teenagers spend most of their social media time on TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. For many young people, these apps are how they connect with friends and see what others are doing. However, experts are discussing the possible effects of spending so much time online, especially on mental health and well-being. Some people are worried about how this affects teens' daily lives and sleep patterns.

**AI Will Change Jobs, Not Destroy Them, Says Microsoft**

Microsoft, a big technology company, believes that artificial intelligence (AI) will change how we work, but it won't take away most jobs. A new report from Microsoft suggests that AI will help people do their jobs better, rather than making human workers unnecessary.

The company's experts say that AI tools will handle some tasks that are repeated often. This will allow people to focus on more creative or complex parts of their work. For example, AI might help with writing emails or organizing data. This means that many jobs will be "transformed," meaning they will be different, but not "eliminated" completely. The report also highlights the importance of learning new skills to work with AI.

**Spain Debates Limits on Tourism Amid Protests**

Many parts of Spain are experiencing a problem called "overtourism," where too many tourists visit certain areas. This is causing difficulties for local people, and there have been protests in popular places like the Canary Islands and Mallorca. Residents say that the large number of visitors is making housing too expensive and increasing noise and pollution.

Local governments and people are now discussing ways to manage tourism better. Some ideas include putting limits on the number of visitors, increasing tourist taxes, or making it harder to rent homes to tourists. The goal is to balance the economic benefits that tourism brings with the need to protect the quality of life for local communities. Spain wants to remain a top travel destination but also ensure that it's a good place to live.
