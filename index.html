**Article 1**

The city council has approved a new initiative to promote green energy. The plan includes subsidies for homeowners who install solar panels and tax breaks for businesses that use renewable energy sources. The goal is to reduce the city's carbon footprint by 20% over the next five years.

This initiative is part of a broader effort to address climate change at the local level. The council hopes that by incentivizing green energy, they can encourage residents and businesses to make more environmentally friendly choices. They also plan to invest in public transportation and improve the city's recycling program.

**Article 2**

A new study has found that regular exercise can improve mental health. Researchers followed a group of adults for six months and found that those who exercised regularly reported lower levels of stress and anxiety. They also experienced improved sleep quality and increased energy levels.

The study suggests that even moderate amounts of exercise can have a significant impact on mental well-being. Experts recommend that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. This could include activities such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.

**Article 3**

The museum hopes that the exhibit will provide visitors with a greater appreciation for human history and cultural diversity. The exhibit is open to the public and will run for three months. Admission is free for students and seniors.
