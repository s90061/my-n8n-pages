            <h1>Gandhi Photography Exhibition Opens in Taichung; Indian Deputy Representative Hopes to Promote Mutual Understanding</h1>
            <p>The "Exploring the Legend of Mahatma Gandhi" photo exhibition started today at the National Public Information Library in Taichung. At the opening, Mr. Vinayak Prataprao Chavan, the Deputy Representative of India in Taiwan, said that Gandhi's idea of "seeking freedom without violence" was a very important part of India's independence. He also said it matches Taiwan's values of democracy, human rights, and peace. He hopes this event will help both sides understand each other better.</p>
            <p>The India Taipei Association released a press statement today. It said that to remember Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on October 2nd, an opening ceremony for the "Exploring the Legend of Mahatma Gandhi" photo exhibition was held today. Mr. Vinayak Prataprao Chavan, the Deputy Representative of India in Taiwan and Deputy Director-General of the India Taipei Association, and Ms. Ma Hsiang-ping, the Director of the National Public Information Library, spoke at the event. Other important people from government and schools, like Ms. Lin Hui-fen from the Taichung City Government International Affairs Committee and Ms. Liao Hsiao-jou, the principal of Ta-Tung Elementary School in Taichung's West District, also attended.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Mr. Chavan said that Gandhi's idea of "seeking freedom without violence" was not only a main part of India's independence but also connects with Taiwan's strong belief in democracy, human rights, and peace. Both India and Taiwan are diverse societies. They both think it's important to help citizens participate and also speak up for peace and fairness in the world. This event is not just a cultural memory. It is also a key way for India and Taiwan to understand each other better, based on their shared values.</p>
            <p>Ms. Ma Hsiang-ping said that she really respects Gandhi's spirit of peace and non-violence. She feels it is especially valuable in today's troubled world. She was very happy to work with the India Taipei Association to hold this exhibition. She hopes that people who visit will think about and remember Gandhi's spirit through the pictures, books, and displays.</p>
            <p>The India Taipei Association explained that the "Exploring the Legend of Mahatma Gandhi" photo exhibition is happening from the 1st to the 29th at the National Public Information Library in Taichung. It shows many valuable photos, from Gandhi's childhood and his work leading the independence movement to the last moment of his life. The exhibition also shows historical pictures of Gandhi with world leaders. This shows how Gandhi's ideas influenced the world and started talks between countries.</p>
            <p>The India Taipei Association also mentioned that they worked with Ta-Tung Elementary School in Taichung's West District to hold a "Gandhi Children's Painting Competition." The theme was "Living together in harmony." The first prize went to Wang Yi-hsuan, a sixth-grade student from Ta-Tung Elementary School. Her painting showed a soldier with bandages shaking hands with a farmer, and people from different countries taking care of each other. This painting meant peace, working together, and caring for people across borders.</p>
            <p>The India Taipei Association announced that this year's "Diwali" will be held on October 24th in front of the Taichung City Government Plaza. Diwali is also called the "Festival of Lights." It means light winning over darkness, and good winning over evil. This matches Gandhi's spirit. They hope that these cultural events will help Taiwanese people learn more about Indian culture and also make the cultural and value connections between India and Taiwan stronger.</p>

            <h1>Screenplay Novel "Zero-Day Attack" Released; Director Lo Ching-jen Hopes the Predictions Don't Come True</h1>
            <p>The Taiwanese TV show "Zero-Day Attack" is very popular in Taiwan and will finish soon. Today, a book launch was held in Taipei for the original script and a novel based on the show. The director, Lo Ching-jen, said he hopes the show and the book will only be historical records, and that none of the predictions in the book will actually happen.</p>
            <p>Lo Ching-jen said in his speech that since the show started, some unexpected things have happened. He thought it was just an art and entertainment show, and people would just decide if they wanted to watch it or not, or if they liked it or not. But then, a very strong opinion appeared: that people "should not watch" the show. They said the show was creating problems, arguments, and encouraging strong feelings. He found this very surprising.</p>
            <p>Lo Ching-jen said that this third opinion is very important. Taiwanese people should be aware of it and think deeply about it.</p>
            <p>The producer of "Zero-Day Attack," Cheng Hsin-mei, said in her speech that the main goal of making this TV show was to prevent war and to stop Taiwan from becoming a battlefield. This TV show and novel look at many human issues. Especially, they show how the Chinese Communist Party uses hidden ways to influence Taiwan and how it takes advantage of human weaknesses. She said, "If we can learn something important and think carefully from this story, maybe we can stop a war from happening, This is what everyone who worked on this show hopes for."</p>
            <p>Mr. Akio Yaita, the CEO of the Indo-Pacific Strategy Think Tank and a supporter of the book, said in his speech that being aware of danger is very important. This TV show helps Taiwanese people understand what they need to protect. There is a Chinese saying, "Always be ready to die, but always try to live." Only by being aware of danger and working together to protect Taiwan's democracy and freedom, is the most important thing right now.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from Blackbody Culture, the novel based on "Zero-Day Attack" was written by four new writers: Hedwig, Li Yi-hsuan, Six Strings, and Floating Spirit. They used different topics from the TV show to write medium-length stories. These stories talk about the threat of war, leaving home, the temptation of money, and human struggles. They show the inner thoughts of Taiwanese people when two strong powers are in conflict.</p>
            <p>The original scriptbook for "Zero-Day Attack" includes the final scripts for all 10 episodes, discussions during the production, and expert comments. It also openly shares the making of the show in a non-fiction way. This helps readers understand the story about "something happening to Taiwan" and how the creators kept the story exciting and critical despite political, cultural, and media pressure.</p>

            <h1>PChome Teams Up with Uni-President; E-commerce Membership Points Can Be Used Across Different Stores</h1>
            <p>Uni-President company bought shares in PChome Online last year. Now, PChome 24h Shopping has announced that it will join the Uni-President Group's OPENPOINT system. This is because the busy online shopping season for Double 11 is coming soon, and they see a big chance for points members. This new change will let people use OPENPOINT points to pay for things. PChome 24h Shopping will now be part of Uni-President's system, which has 19 million members.</p>
            <p>Experts in retail say that this cooperation means connecting the members of two big shopping systems. For Uni-President, adding PChome to its member system makes Uni-President a stronger leader in the world of points. It also means points can be used in more places. For PChome, joining Uni-President's member system will make members shop more often and stay with PChome. It's a win-win situation for both.</p>
            <p>PChome 24h Shopping said that in Taiwan's retail and online shopping world, using points to buy things has become very common. Market information suggests that more than half of the people in Taiwan have different kinds of points. The total value of points given out each year is over 50 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>In June and July of this year, PChome worked with uniopen PRIMA subscription members. They offered special deals and gave out P-coin codes. Data from these months showed that 80% of these members started using PChome more. This showed that connecting different points systems has a lot of potential.</p>
            <p>PChome 24h Shopping stated that they currently have over 13 million members. They are also creating their own online shopping points system. Besides connecting P-coins with banks, they also work with phone companies to let people use points to pay. They are always trying to make points more useful and make members use them more often in different situations.</p>
            <p>PChome 24h Shopping pointed out that OPENPOINT, which belongs to Uni-President, is a good example of a well-developed points system in Taiwan. They see that uniopen members are loyal and that PChome's online shopping offers many choices and is convenient. They hope that by connecting these two big member systems, which each have millions of members, points will bring more people to shop. They want to offer customers services that combine online and offline shopping. They hope this will make people buy more things and help their business grow.</p>
