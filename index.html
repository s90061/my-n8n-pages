            <h1>Trump: May Give Air Help to Ukraine, No Soldiers on Ground</h1>
            <p>On August 19, in Washington, US President Trump said he would not send soldiers to Ukraine. This is for any peace agreement. But he offered to give air support. At the same time, European countries started talking about safety promises before a possible meeting between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency said that Trump is working hard to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Yesterday, he met with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy and many European leaders at the White House. This meeting happened just three days after Trump's important talks with Russian President Putin in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Trump said that Putin agreed to meet Zelenskyy. He also agreed to some safety promises from Western countries for Ukraine. But Ukraine and Western countries are thinking carefully about these promises. Many details are still not clear.</p>
            <p>Three people who know about the talks told AFP that Putin offered to meet Zelenskyy in Moscow when he spoke with Trump. One person said that Zelenskyy quickly said no to meeting in the capital city of the country that attacked.</p>
            <p>Since Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022, the US has given billions of dollars to Kyiv. Trump has strongly criticized this. He said that European countries are "ready to send soldiers" to make sure a peace deal happens.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to Fox News and said, "France, Germany, and a few other countries like the UK want to send soldiers. We are willing to help, especially with air support."</p>

            <h1>US Commerce Secretary Says They Are Talking About Buying Intel Shares; Says Chip Production Cannot Depend on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>On August 19, in Washington, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the US is talking about buying 10% of Intel's shares. This comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to give 15% of their profits from selling chips to China back to the government. He also repeated his idea, which he often said before becoming a secretary, that the US needs to make its own chips. He said, "We cannot depend on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Lutnick told CNBC, an American business news channel, that the US government might become the biggest shareholder in Intel. But this would not give them control over how Intel is run. He said, "This is not about control. We are just changing money from the Biden government into shares. Also, the US government will not have voting rights."</p>
            <p>Lutnick again criticized the Chip Act signed by former President Joe Biden. He said the law gave money to companies that make semiconductors, but US taxpayers did not get anything back for it.</p>
            <p>He asked, "Why should we give so much money to a company worth 100 billion US dollars (about 3 trillion New Taiwan dollars)? What good does this do for American taxpayers? Trump's answer is that we should use this money to get shares in the company."</p>
            <p>Intel got the most money from the "Chips Act." It received 7.9 billion US dollars to make commercial semiconductors. It also got 3 billion US dollars from the Pentagon's "Secure Enclave" project. On top of this, Intel can ask for 11 billion US dollars in loans.</p>
            <p>Lutnick said, "Imagine this: the Biden government actually gave money to Intel for free, and also to TSMC for free. All these companies just took money without giving anything back."</p>
            <p>Earlier, Bloomberg, quoting White House officials and other people who know, reported that the Trump government is talking about buying about 10% of Intel's shares. At the same time, Japan's SoftBank Group also said it will invest 2 billion US dollars to buy shares in Intel, becoming one of Intel's top ten shareholders.</p>
            <p>If the White House decides to buy shares, it will greatly help Intel's money situation. Intel has been firing people and cutting spending recently, so people in the market are paying close attention to these talks.</p>
            <p>Today, Intel's stock price in New York went up by 11% at one point. SoftBank's stock, which trades in Tokyo, went down by 4% when the market closed today.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg said that the US government talking about buying shares in Intel shows a big change in American chip policy. If this deal is completed, it could set a path for Washington to make similar deals with other chip makers.</p>
            <p>Lutnick also said today that for national safety, the US wants to bring some chip making back to the US. He said, "We need to make our own chips. We cannot depend on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>At the same time, Lutnick did not say no to letting Nvidia sell its new AI chips, which are still being made, to China. Reuters reported that this AI chip will use the newest Blackwell design. It will be more powerful than the H20 chip that is currently allowed to be sent to China.</p>
            <p>When Lutnick talked about Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, he said, "Of course, he wants to sell a new chip to China. I have heard him talk to the President about it, and the President listens to the ideas from these good technology companies. In the end, he will decide what to do."</p>
