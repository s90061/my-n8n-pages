**Nantou Prosecutors Investigate Petition Signatures, Group Denies Forgery**

Prosecutors in Nantou searched places today linked to groups trying to remove KMT legislator You Hao and DPP councilor Chen Yu-ling from their positions. They brought the main people leading these groups in for questioning. The group trying to remove You Hao said that all the signatures they collected are real and not fake or used by someone else without permission. They believe in the law and will help fully with the investigation.

Both leaders, Lin Jing-tong (for You Hao's removal) and Tsai Yi-chu (for Chen Yu-ling's removal), were questioned as suspects because someone made complaints against them. Other people were questioned as witnesses. The group for You Hao's removal later said that they always follow the law and check signatures carefully. They added that all signatures were gathered by volunteers. They asked for the truth to be found quickly to clear Lin Jing-tong and their group's name. They also mentioned that rumors about "death signatures" should not make people doubt the honest work of the people who signed and the volunteers.

According to the Central Election Commission, for You Hao's removal case, 23,160 people signed the petition. From these, 19,140 signatures were valid, but 4,020 were not valid. Among the invalid ones, 56 people had died before they signed. The DPP spokesperson Wu Zheng said on May 19 that the KMT's efforts to remove DPP Nantou County councilors Chen Yu-ling and Tsai Ming-hsuan had many invalid signatures, including "death signatures." For Chen Yu-ling, there were 50 death signatures and 1252 invalid ones. For Tsai Ming-hsuan, there were 66 death signatures and 2503 invalid ones.

**Wugu Interchange North Exit Ramp Project Ahead of Schedule, Minister Says October Completion**

Taiwan's Minister of Transportation, Chen Shih-kai, announced today that the north exit ramp of the Wugu Interchange project is moving faster than expected and should be finished by October. He said this during a visit to the construction site.

This project started on April 20, 2023. It involves adding new ramps for cars to enter and exit the highway from the north. The main aim is to reduce traffic jams at intersections with traffic lights and make the Wugu Interchange work better and safer for drivers. Minister Chen visited two construction areas for the north exit ramp and received a report on the project's progress. Because there is a lot of traffic and the work is complicated, the construction workers have been working almost day and night.

Minister Chen thanked the workers for their hard work in the hot weather. He said the project is 4% ahead of its planned schedule. He wants the entire project to be finished by 2027 as planned. However, the north exit ramp is expected to open in October this year, and he believes that people will clearly notice better traffic flow once it is open.

Additionally, Chen gave flowers to Zhao Xing-hua, the head of the Freeway Bureau, who is retiring today. Chen thanked him for working hard until his last day in public service. Zhao Xing-hua explained that the Wugu Interchange is a very important road for the Wugu, Xinzhuang, and Taishan areas. It also connects to Provincial Highway 64 and 65, bringing in traffic from Luzhou, Bali, Sanchong, Banqiao, and parts of Tucheng. It is a key part of the road system in the greater Taipei area. He believes that the improvements will help solve problems where cars cross paths when entering or exiting the highway. By using the new ramps to separate car flows, it will greatly improve how well the highway works and reduce traffic in local areas.
