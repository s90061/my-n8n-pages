            <h1>Huang Shih-chung: Using Nvidia Platform to Develop Humanoid Robot Brains, Aiming for Mass Production Next Year</h1>
            <p>Techman Robot is now one of the top three collaborative robot makers in the world. People are excited about its progress in making humanoid robots. Recently, Mr. Huang Shih-chung, the chief operating officer of Techman Robot, and the head of the AI Vision and Humanoid Innovation Center, spoke with a news team. Mr. Huang said that humanoid robots using Nvidia's "brain" technology could be mass-produced as early as 2026.</p>
            <p>Techman Robot's humanoid robot lab in Taoyuan's Guishan district was shown to the public for the first time. Mr. Huang Shih-chung stated that Techman Robot plans to enter the humanoid robot market, building on its experience with collaborative robots.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Kuo-wei, a manager at Techman Robot's Humanoid Innovation Center, explained that the company aims to control the main parts of humanoid robots itself. They will use their experience in making parts for collaborative robots to create new ways to combine parts for humanoid robots. Techman Robot also plans to develop full-body controllers and self-balancing parts for humanoid robots. Currently, the company's team for humanoid robot research and development has tens of people.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Shih-chung shared that Techman Robot has worked with Nvidia, a big AI chip company, for a long time. For humanoid robot technology, Techman Robot has regular meetings with Nvidia. Techman Robot is using Nvidia's humanoid robot platform for the brain's hardware. They are still testing it inside the company. They expect Techman Robot's humanoid robots to start being mass-produced by 2026.</p>
            <p>Looking at how much money humanoid robots will bring in, Mr. Huang Shih-chung believes that after about 3 to 5 years, there will be a strong demand from the market. Humanoid robots might start to be sold in small numbers and earn money for the company.</p>
            <p>For uses, Mr. Huang Kuo-wei said that customers from semiconductor foundries, packaging and testing companies, and other large electronics companies are talking with Techman Robot about using humanoid robots. Quanta Group, Techman Robot's parent company, is also very interested. They expect that in the future, these robots will be used in manufacturing for production, checking, inspecting by eye, and other tests. This also includes checking AI server cabinets.</p>
            <p>In the area of collaborative robots, Techman Robot continues to grow its brand. People in the industry say that Techman Robot is already one of the top three collaborative robot makers in the world. The top two are Universal Robots from Denmark and Fanuc from Japan. Other companies, like the ABB robot division (recently sold to Japan's SoftBank Group), KUKA, Yaskawa Electric from Japan, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries from Japan, are also working hard in this field.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Chung-hsien, the head of Techman Robot's Visual Application Business Unit, leads the robot vision software engineering team. He works with hardware and electrical control engineers. The team started with only 2 to 3 people, but now it has almost 30 people. He said that putting visual sensing technology into robotic arms was new for the market. This is what makes Techman Robot's collaborative robots different.</p>
            <p>Techman Robot has also developed AI visual recognition technology. In 2022, they launched a collaborative robot solution with built-in AI visual recognition. This made Techman Robot's collaborative robots useful for more things. AI applications also created new opportunities for collaborative robots in automated quality inspection.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Chung-hsien pointed out that Techman Robot's AI visual collaborative robots are used not only in wafer foundries to pick up wafer boxes but also in other electronics factories for assembling, testing, and packaging. This includes circuit boards, checking AI servers for big OEM companies, and production lines in semiconductor packaging and testing factories.</p>
            <p>Besides the semiconductor and electronics industries, Mr. Huang Shih-chung said that Techman Robot's AI collaborative robots are also used in aerospace. For example, AIDC and JPP-KY use Techman collaborative robots to make aerospace parts.</p>
            <p>Also, Techman Robot works with AMET, an American company that makes smart welding technology. They use welding collaborative robots in shipbuilding, for welding large steel structures in airport terminals, and in offshore wind power. They want to get a share of the global market for automated AI welding. Mr. Huang Chung-hsien revealed that Techman Robot's AI visual collaborative robots are also used in Japanese car manufacturers' production and inspection processes.</p>
            <p>Techman Robot's AI visual collaborative robots are expanding globally. They have built a network of over 100 distributors. Mr. Huang Shih-chung shared that the European and Chinese markets each make up about 20% of their sales. Taiwan makes up a bit more than 10%. Techman Robot is actively growing in the American market. In Mexico, they are working with Taiwanese OEM electronics manufacturers who have factories there.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Shih-chung stated that sales in the North American market are currently less than 10%. He expects that by 2026 to 2027, the North American market will make up more than 10% of their sales.</p>

            <h1>A Look Inside Techman Robot's Production Line: Humanoid Robot Lab Shown Publicly for the First Time</h1>
            <p>Techman Robot has worked hard for ten years to build Taiwan's own robot brand. Their AI vision collaborative robots are now widely used in the semiconductor and electronics industries. The market is very excited about their humanoid robots. Recently, a news team visited Techman Robot's main office in Guishan, Taoyuan. They were able to see the robot testing production line, which is usually not shown to the public.</p>
            <p>When you first enter the testing production line on the 7th floor of Techman Robot's office building, you see many collaborative robots neatly arranged. They are performing various tests. Some are lifting heavy objects and turning them, while others are moving at different angles.</p>
            <p>Testing of Collaborative Robots: Using Big Data for Smart Manufacturing</p>
            <p>During the tests, only a few Techman Robot employees were at nearby workstations, watching the process. The testing area was almost silent, with only faint sounds from the collaborative robots turning. Photographers and video colleagues who were with the news team described it as "white noise that helps you sleep."</p>
            <p>A Techman Robot public relations person, who showed the news team around the entire testing line, explained that collaborative robots are tested 24 hours a day without stopping. This is to make sure they can work for a long time in real production lines for customers. At the testing site, Techman Robot's own monitoring system instantly shows how well the products are doing in tests. The data from these tests is put into a database for big data analysis, which helps with smart manufacturing and managing production lines.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Shih-chung, the chief operating officer of Techman Robot, said that in 2014, when Techman Robot was still the robot department of Quanta Storage under the Quanta Group, they started planning to make collaborative robots with built-in vision sensing technology. Today, these robots are widely used in manufacturing lines for semiconductors and electronics. They have gained a lot of practical experience. This experience is a very important foundation for Techman Robot to build its robot brand and to further develop humanoid robots.</p>
            <p>Mr. Barry Lam, the chairman of Quanta Computer, described Techman Robot's journey from nothing to creating robot solutions over ten years as "the golden grandson growing up" in Taiwanese Hokkien, at a press conference before Techman Robot went public. He said that Quanta Computer went public in 1999, and Quanta Storage in 2002. It took so long for Techman Robot to go public at the end of September this year. He noted, "This shows how hard it is to create robots."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lam pointed out that Techman Robot has technologies like AI vision, machine learning, and collaborative robots. These can help customers add more value to their products. He said that Techman Robot is no longer just making products for other companies. It is Taiwan's first company with its own brand of collaborative robots. He added, "They are not just cheap; they can also solve customers' problems."</p>
            <p>On the day of the interview, Techman Robot also took the news team to see their humanoid robot lab, which is rarely open to the public. With help from engineers there, the humanoid robot, which has AI vision recognition, showed different body movements and talked with people.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Shih-chung said that Techman Robot is slowly planning its humanoid robots, first understanding what the industry and customers really need. He clearly stated that for humanoid robots to be popular in the industry, "lowering costs and increasing value for money" are the most important things. More importantly, humanoid robots must be able to truly solve customer problems. With a "killer application" (a very useful main purpose), humanoid robots can truly become a part of the industry.</p>
            <p>Humanoid Robots Without Lower Bodies to Reduce Safety Risks in Manufacturing Production Lines</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Shih-chung shared that Techman Robot's humanoid robots first focus on designing the upper body's functions. They are developing integrated hardware and software solutions for the brain, arms, and hands. They are targeting the needs of manufacturing production lines. They are using Taiwan's existing strengths in the semiconductor and electronics industries to promote the use of humanoid robots in semiconductor and electronics factories.</p>
            <p>This is also why Techman Robot's current humanoid robot samples do not have lower bodies and feet. Techman Robot explained that the first generation of humanoid robot design is to meet the actual needs of factory production lines. If a robot stands and works on its feet, there might be unexpected safety risks, like suddenly falling over. By first designing the upper body functions like the brain and hands, humanoid robots can help the industry improve productivity.</p>
            <p>Looking at future plans for humanoid robots, Mr. Huang Shih-chung stated that by using the brand they have built for collaborative robots, Techman Robot plans to offer complete humanoid robot solutions in the future. They will continue to use their brand to reach global markets, find important "killer applications" in different industries to create more value, and make Techman Robot's humanoid robots famous worldwide.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Fengshen Forms: Wu Te-Jung Warns of Disastrous Rains in North and East Due to Autumn Typhoon Effect</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Fengshen, the 24th typhoon of the year, formed early this morning. Weather expert Wu Te-Jung said that the northeast monsoon will start moving south tonight. This will bring rain to the greater Taipei area and the eastern part of Taiwan. Temperatures will slowly drop. From tomorrow until October 22nd, due to the "autumn typhoon effect," there will be a lot of rain in the north and east. People need to be careful of "heavy rainfall" that could cause disasters.</p>
            <p>Today, the Central Weather Administration announced that a typhoon has formed. The tropical depression, which was east of the Philippines, became a mild typhoon at 2 AM. It is named Fengshen (international name: FENGSHEN), number 24. It is expected to move through the central Philippines towards the sea near the Zhongsha and Xisha Islands. It will not directly affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Te-Jung, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column "Classroom of Heavenly Secrets" for the Weather Application Promotion Foundation. He pointed out that the latest path prediction map from the Central Weather Administration shows that mild Typhoon Fengshen is expected to pass northwest through Luzon Island and enter the South China Sea. It will then move closer to Hainan Island and gradually turn southwest. The area where its path is uncertain is on both sides of this predicted path.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Te-Jung stated that the newest European model (ECMWF) shows that by 8 PM tomorrow evening, Typhoon Fengshen will have passed Luzon Island and entered the South China Sea. Taiwan will then start to be affected by the "autumn typhoon effect," which is when the typhoon's outer winds combine with the northeast monsoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Te-Jung noted that today, most places will be sunny and hot during the day. There is a small chance of local rain in the mountains in the afternoon. The northern coast and eastern Taiwan also have a small chance of brief, scattered rain. He added that starting tonight, the northeast monsoon will move south, bringing rain to the greater Taipei area and eastern Taiwan, and temperatures will slowly go down.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, Mr. Wu Te-Jung said that today, the north is expected to be 23 to 36 degrees Celsius, the central part 23 to 36 degrees, the south 23 to 37 degrees, and the east 21 to 35 degrees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Te-Jung pointed out that the latest model simulations show that from tomorrow until October 22nd, there is a chance of rain everywhere. High temperatures in northern Taiwan will drop more due to clouds and rain. The cold air is not very strong, but temperatures will slowly go down each day. The lowest temperature in northern Taiwan could reach about 20 degrees, making it noticeably cooler. He said that due to the "autumn typhoon effect" (the combination of Fengshen's outer winds and the northeast monsoon), there will be heavy rain in the north and east. People need to be careful of "heavy rainfall" that could cause disasters. The chance is highest in the northern mountains and the northeast, followed by Hualien and Taitung, which should also be watched.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Te-Jung said that on October 23rd and 24th, Fengshen will weaken and move away. Taiwan will be affected by the northeast monsoon, bringing significant rain to the north and east. There is still a chance of local torrential rain, and northern Taiwan will remain cool.</p>
