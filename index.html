Younger generations, like Gen Z and Millennials, are changing their spending habits. A recent study shows they are buying fewer non-essential items because of rising prices. They are cutting back on things like new clothes, eating out, and even some online subscriptions. This trend highlights how inflation is affecting people's daily lives and making them think more carefully about their money.

**AI Predicted to Transform Majority of Jobs in Developed Countries**

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently stated that artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to affect about 60% of jobs in developed countries. This means that AI technology will change many roles, making some tasks easier, while potentially creating new jobs in other areas. However, some jobs might also be lost. The IMF suggests that workers will need to adapt and learn new skills to succeed in this changing work environment. This prediction highlights the significant impact AI is having on the global job market.

**Popular Destinations Grapple with Overtourism**

After the pandemic, many popular travel destinations are facing 'overtourism' once again. This means too many tourists visit at one time, which can damage natural sites, put pressure on local services, and annoy residents. To tackle this problem, some places are introducing new rules. For example, they might limit the number of daily visitors, increase entry fees, or promote travel during off-peak seasons. These efforts aim to protect the environment and local culture, ensuring a better experience for both tourists and residents in the long term.
