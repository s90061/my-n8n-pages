**JieKou Payment Faces Suspension, Some Tea Shops Temporarily Stop Using It**

JieKou Payment is facing a problem where some shops are stopping its use. This is because of a disagreement between its parent company and another company called Taishan. For example, the tea shop "Tea Presso" announced today that they will temporarily not accept JieKou Payment. However, other food businesses are still using it or letting their shops decide.

McDonald's, a fast-food chain, said that their payment systems are working normally. If there are any changes, they will announce them quickly to protect their customers. Burger King also said they have not received any news about changes.

Tea Presso, a chain tea shop, said they are temporarily stopping JieKou Payment and suggest customers use other payment methods. Kuai Chi Ming Pin, another tea shop, said they respect what each of their shops decides to do.

JieKou Payment stated that the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has said that all user money must be kept in a trust bank and separate from the company's own money. JieKou Payment follows these rules, so the money in the trust account is safe and not affected by the company's dispute.
