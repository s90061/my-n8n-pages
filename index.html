            <h1>U12 World Cup Baseball: Hu Cheng-en Hits a Homer, Taiwan and Korea Tied 2-2</h1>
            <p>On August 2nd, the U12 World Cup Baseball tournament is happening in Tainan. Taiwan's team played against South Korea tonight. Taiwan's player, Hu Cheng-en, hit a home run that scored two runs, putting Taiwan ahead.</p>
            <p>However, in the bottom of the fourth inning, the Korean team managed to tie the score. They had all bases full of players, and one of their players got a free walk to first base, which brought in a run. At this point, the game was tied 2-2 with two players out and bases still full. The game then stopped because of heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Before this game, Taiwan's team had won two games and lost two. This game was part of the Super Round. The game started 15 minutes earlier than planned, without an audience, because people were worried about the weather.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's starting pitcher was Wu Shang-cheng, a left-handed thrower. In the first inning, after one player was out, two hits were made against him, putting Korean players on bases where they could score. Then, a fly ball was hit, and a Korean player scored one run.</p>
            <p>Taiwan did not score in the first two innings. But in the third inning, Hu Cheng-en hit his two-run home run, which was his third home run in this tournament.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's starting pitcher, Wu Shang-cheng, pitched for three innings and let in one run. In the fourth inning, Hsieh Cheng-chun took over as pitcher. He allowed two hits and gave away two free walks, which allowed Korea to tie the score. When the game stopped due to heavy rain, it was 2-2, with two outs, bases loaded, and the first Korean batter at the plate.</p>
            <p>The results of the games between Taiwan and Korea, and between the USA and Japan, are very important for Taiwan to reach the championship game. For Taiwan to play in the final, Japan needs to beat the USA, and Taiwan needs to beat Korea. After that, they would compare something called "Team Quality Balance" (TQB) to decide. Right now, the USA is leading Japan 5-0.</p>

            <h1>South Africa Cracks Down on Illegal Gold Mining by Immigrants, 1,000 Arrested</h1>
            <p>Police in Mpumalanga province, which is in the northeast of South Africa, told AFP news agency that they have arrested about 1,000 people. These arrests happened during an operation that started on July 28. The police were trying to stop illegal immigrants from mining gold without permission.</p>
            <p>This operation focused on areas near Barberton, a town close to the borders of Eswatini and Mozambique. Barberton Mines, the company that owns the Sheba gold mine in that area, said in a statement that they had to close the mine earlier this year because it was not making money, and they let go of many workers. Local people and former workers strongly protested this. The company now understands why, saying, "now we know why."</p>
            <p>Barberton Mines explained, "Food and supplies were constantly being sent to an illegal mining world that was growing underground. This had to be stopped. That is why this operation was launched with the police and the mine's security staff. Illegal mining will not be allowed, and this message needs to be widely known."</p>
            <p>During the operation, the police surrounded the illegal mine shafts. This stopped supplies from reaching the people inside, which forced them to come out of the ground.</p>
            <p>Donald Mdhluli, a police spokesperson, said: "As soon as they came out, they were arrested... About 1,000 illegal miners were arrested, and these people are also illegal immigrants... So far, no one has died."</p>
            <p>He also added that more arrests might happen because there are still illegal miners underground.</p>

            <h1>Jih Sun Life Company Asks High Court to Review Law, Claiming Their Right to Sue Was Taken Away; Court Says No</h1>
            <p>Jih Sun Life Technology Company lost a court case about late payment interest. After losing, they asked Taiwan's Constitutional Court to review the law. They said that new changes to the Constitutional Litigation Act made it too difficult for people to go to court and get a fair hearing, which they believe takes away people's right to sue, a right protected by the Constitution. However, the Constitutional Court decided not to accept their request because it did not meet the necessary conditions.</p>
            <p>Jih Sun Life Technology Company argued in its request that a specific ruling by the Supreme Court from 2023 used rules about pre-sale housing contracts that went beyond what the Consumer Protection Act allowed. They said this took away their freedom to make contracts and to run their business as they wished. They also argued that charging unlimited late fees based on a fixed percentage was unfair and went against fair principles. They believed this harmed their property rights, their freedom to make contracts, and their freedom to do business, all of which are protected by the Constitution.</p>
            <p>Jih Sun Life also stated that the Constitutional Litigation Act, which was changed and passed on December 20, 2024, set too high a minimum number of judges needed for the Constitutional Court to discuss and make decisions on cases. This "fixed number rule" did not consider if there were fewer judges available in reality. They said this rule seriously limited whether the Constitutional Court could accept a case or declare a law unconstitutional. This made it much harder for people to get proper help from the Constitutional Court, effectively making it harder to use the legal system to solve problems, and taking away people's right to sue, which is protected by the Constitution.</p>
            <p>The Constitutional Court explained that the final court decision in Jih Sun Life's case did not use the rules about pre-sale housing contracts or the Consumer Protection Act that Jih Sun Life was complaining about. Because of this, Jih Sun Life could not ask for a review of those specific rules. Also, Jih Sun Life's request to review the new Constitutional Litigation Act was also rejected. The court said that the new Constitutional Litigation Act was not the law that was used in their final court case, so it did not meet the requirements for a constitutional review.</p>
            <p>Even though the court officially rejected this case, some judges, including Justice Chen Chung-wu, Chief Justice (acting President of the Judicial Yuan) Hsieh Ming-yang, and Justice Yu Po-hsiang, wrote a separate opinion agreeing with parts of Jih Sun Life's concerns. This made the case get attention from the public.</p>
            <p>The separate opinion said that judges should respect laws made by the government, as long as those laws follow the Constitution. However, if a law like the Constitutional Litigation Act has problems or might go against the Constitution, judges should not have to follow it if doing so would make court procedures unconstitutional. If judges had to follow such a flawed law, it could not only make individual court cases unfair but also allow the government to reduce the power of judges and break the system of separate powers in the government.</p>
