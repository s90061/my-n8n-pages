            <h1>Lin Chia-cheng Joins Independent League Blue Crabs, Former Springboard for Wang Chien-ming to Return to MLB</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese baseball player Lin Chia-cheng was let go by his team last week. Today, he shared that he has joined the Blue Crabs, a team in an independent league. A famous player, Wang Chien-ming, played for this same team 10 years ago. He then went back to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) the next year.</p>
            <p>After waiting for one week, Lin Chia-cheng announced on social media today that he has joined the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs. This team is part of the Atlantic League.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-cheng flew to join the team on August 4th. Today, he played in an away game in North Carolina. He started the game as the second batter.</p>
            <p>The Southern Maryland Blue Crabs play their home games in Waldorf, Maryland, on the East Coast of the United States. This will be Lin Chia-cheng's new home for more than a month. He will continue to play games for the rest of the season. He hopes to get noticed by teams in the US professional baseball system.</p>
            <p>Most people think that the Atlantic League is similar in skill level to Minor League 2A and 3A. Many players in this league have played in 3A or MLB before. Also, new talented players who have been released from Minor League teams come here to try and get better. Wang Chien-ming, a retired legendary pitcher from Taiwan, played for the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in 2015.</p>
            <p>In 2015, Wang Chien-ming was 35 years old. At the start of that year, he played for the Braves' 3A team. On June 19th, the Braves released him. Four days later, he joined the Atlantic League's Blue Crabs. That year, he said in a statement, "Pitchers who have been hurt need to work extra hard." His strong spirit touched many fans.</p>
            <p>Wang Chien-ming pitched three strong games for the Blue Crabs that year. Then, the Seattle Mariners liked what they saw and signed him to their Minor League 3A team. The next year, he got a chance to play in MLB again with the Kansas City Royals. After three years of hard work, he played in 38 more MLB games.</p>

            <h1>Unboxing Old Photos: Lifeline 1995 Hotline Now One Number</h1>
            <p>When news reports talk about suicide, they often include a warning at the end. This warning tells people to check how they are feeling and offers help for mental health. One of these resources is the "1995" Lifeline phone service. Its start began with the "Suicide Prevention Center" at MacKay Memorial Hospital.</p>
            <p>In 1969, MacKay Memorial Hospital started a suicide prevention center. It quickly helped people who came to the emergency room because they had tried to end their lives. On July 1st of the same year, the center and a group called the Taipei North Rotary Club together started the "Lifeline." They opened two phone numbers, "514242" and "514343," to offer advice and support. This was the first place in Asia to offer help for suicide prevention over the phone. Later, countries like Japan and South Korea used it as an example.</p>
            <p>The Lifeline works because trained volunteers help. In the beginning, local groups were set up in cities like Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hsinchu, and Pingtung. To make sure all services were the same and to connect better with groups around the world, the "International Lifeline Association ROC General Assembly" was created on April 15, 1977. This group was in charge of managing all the local groups.</p>
            <p>Years ago, the Lifeline offices in different cities and counties used different phone numbers. Most of them ended with "9595," which sounds like "save me, save me" in Chinese. But because phone numbers in different places were different lengths (from 6 to 8 digits), it was hard to remember and dial quickly. So, in 1998, the Lifeline General Assembly worked to combine the phone numbers. They got help from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and Chunghwa Telecom. On August 10th, they held a press conference. They announced that all Lifeline services across the country would use one short, 4-digit number: "1995." This number sounds like "want to save me, save me" in Chinese, to make it easy for people to call for help. The aim was to give mental support right away.</p>
            <p>To see more pictures of the Lifeline, you can go to the CNA Photo Gallery.</p>
            <p>Value life. Suicide does not solve problems. There is always a way to find help in life. If you need advice or help, you can call the Ministry of Health and Welfare hotline "1925," the Lifeline hotline "1995," or the Chang Teachers' Service hotline "1980."</p>

            <h1>Trump Starts 2028 Olympics Group, Committee Chairman Invites Him to Carry Torch</h1>
            <p>Los Angeles, August 5 (CNA) â€“ Today, US President Trump announced he is creating a special team at the White House for the 2028 Summer Olympics. This team will use the federal government's help to make sure the Olympics happen without problems. Casey Wasserman, who leads the group planning the Olympics, asked Trump to carry the Olympic torch when he spoke. Trump smiled and nodded.</p>
            <p>Today in Washington D.C., Trump signed an official order. After that, he and Casey Wasserman, the leader of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee (LA28), both spoke.</p>
            <p>Many government leaders were there. This showed that the federal government supports the Los Angeles Olympics. Some of these leaders were US Vice President J.D. Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Trump said that the US team has won the most medals at the Summer Olympics for eight times in a row. The US also has the most gold medals in the Summer Olympics, three times more than the country in second place. He believes the US team will win the most medals again in 2028.</p>
            <p>Trump said that the 2026 World Cup soccer tournament will be held in the US. Also, 2028 will be 250 years since the United States was formed. He said it is the best time to be a sports fan in America, and 2028 will be a very special year in US history.</p>
            <p>Casey Wasserman, the head of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, thanked the federal government for its support. He said that the Trump government has agreed to give important money for safety. This money will be used by local, state, and federal groups for security plans to make sure the Olympics are safe.</p>
            <p>Wasserman's speech also mentioned that 150 leaders from countries around the world will visit Los Angeles. More than 10,000 Olympic athletes and 4,500 Paralympic athletes will compete. Millions of people across the US are expected to come and watch the games.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Olympic torch relay traveled through 38 states in the US. Wasserman said this Olympics will be the first time the torch goes through all 50 states. He directly invited Trump, "Mr. President, if you would like to run along Park Avenue again and remember history, we would be very happy."</p>
            <p>Before the 2004 Athens Olympics, Trump carried the torch. He ran on Park Avenue in New York as part of that torch relay.</p>
