            <h1>US Envoy Tells Israeli Hostage Families: US and Israel Are Making a Plan to End the War</h1>
            <p>An American envoy for Middle East affairs, Steve Witkoff, told Israeli families today that he is working with the Israeli government. Their goal is to create a plan that will truly end the war in Gaza. These families have loved ones held by the Palestinian group Hamas.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Mr. Witkoff is visiting Israel. This visit comes as the Israeli government is facing more and more pressure. This is because the humanitarian situation in Gaza is getting worse.</p>
            <p>Reuters heard a recording of the meeting. In the recording, Mr. Witkoff said: "We are working with the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We are making a very good plan. This plan is to rebuild Gaza. This means the war will truly end."</p>
            <p>Mr. Witkoff also said that Hamas is ready to give up its weapons to end the war. However, Hamas has said many times that they do not want to give up their weapons.</p>
            <p>The White House has not yet answered questions about what Mr. Witkoff said.</p>

            <h1>Hamas Says It Will Not Give Up Weapons Unless Palestine Becomes a Separate Country</h1>
            <p>The Palestinian group Hamas said today that it will not give up its weapons unless an independent Palestinian country is formed. This means Hamas has again said no to a main demand from Israel to end the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that indirect talks between Hamas and Israel stopped last week. These talks aimed to get a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and an agreement to free hostages.</p>
            <p>On July 29, Qatar and Egypt, who are helping to arrange the ceasefire, supported a statement from France and Saudi Arabia. This statement described steps for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It included that Hamas must give its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, which is supported by Western countries.</p>
            <p>But Hamas said in a statement that it will not give up its right to "armed resistance." This is unless an "independent Palestinian state with full control and Jerusalem as its capital" is created.</p>
            <p>Israel believes that Hamas giving up its weapons is a very important condition for any agreement to end the conflict. However, Hamas has said many times that they do not want to put down their weapons.</p>

            <h1>India Will Still Buy Russian Oil Even If Trump Threatens Punishment, Say Government Sources</h1>
            <p>Two unnamed sources from the Indian government said that India will continue to buy oil from Russia. This is true even though US President Trump has threatened to punish India.</p>
            <p>One source said: "These are long-term oil agreements. It is not easy to stop buying overnight."</p>
            <p>Last month, Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform "Truth Social" that India would face more punishment. This is because India buys weapons and oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>On the first day of this month, Trump told reporters that he heard India would no longer buy oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported today, quoting two unnamed high-level Indian officials, that the Indian government has not changed its policy. One official said that the government has not told oil companies to buy less oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported this week that India's state-owned oil refineries had stopped buying Russian oil in the past week. This happened after the discounts became smaller in July.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesperson for India's foreign ministry, spoke at a regular press conference. He said: "For our energy needs, we will look at what resources are available in the market and what choices we have. We will also consider the current global situation or environment."</p>
            <p>Mr. Jaiswal added that India and Russia have a "strong and long-standing partnership." He also said that India's relationships with all countries are important on their own. They should not be seen from the point of view of a third country.</p>
