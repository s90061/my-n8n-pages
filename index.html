            <h1>South Korea's Sancheong County Hit by Heavy Rain and Mudslides Again; 6 Dead, 7 Missing After March Wildfire</h1>
            <p>(Seoul, CNA reporter Liao Yu-yang, July 20) Sancheong County in Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea, had a mudslide on July 19. This mountain village was badly damaged again. It had a big wildfire in March this year. At least 6 people have died, and 7 people are missing.</p>
            <p>According to information from South Korea's Ministry of Interior and Safety and the Fire Department, extreme heavy rain has fallen across South Korea for 5 days. Floods and mudslides have caused at least 10 deaths and 9 missing people as of 5 AM today.</p>
            <p>Just from the mudslide in Sancheong County, Gyeongsangnam-do, on July 19, there were 6 deaths and 7 missing. Also, 2 people were seriously hurt, and 58 people were saved. Rescue teams are still looking for people in Sancheong. The number of dead and injured might change.</p>
            <p>Sancheong County received 348.2 millimeters of rain each day from July 16 to 18. On July 19, it rained 283.8 millimeters. The total rain over 4 days was almost as much as the county usually gets in a whole year. Because of this, on July 19, the county gave its first-ever order for everyone to leave their homes. More than 33,000 people quickly moved to safety.</p>
            <p>According to Yonhap News Agency, Sancheong County had a very large forest fire in March this year. That fire burned for 213 hours and killed 4 people. It caused about 28.7 billion Korean Won (about 620 million New Taiwan Dollars) in damage. Some residents' houses have not been rebuilt yet, and they are still living in temporary homes.</p>
            <p>The heavy rain in South Korea has made 12,921 people leave their homes in 9,504 houses across 14 main areas. The area of damaged farmland is 24,247 hectares, which is about the size of 34,000 football fields. (Edited by Chang Chih-hsuan) 1140720</p>

            <h1>Weather Expert Wu Derong: Tropical System Expected from July 23, 40% Chance of Hitting Northern Taiwan</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, CNA reporter Chang Hsiung-feng, July 20) Weather expert Wu Derong said today that the outer clouds of Typhoon Vipa and the monsoon will cause heavy rain in eastern and southern Taiwan. He also said that a new tropical weather system might form within the monsoon from July 23. Right now, the European weather model shows a 40% chance it will affect northern Taiwan.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Administration, Typhoon Vipa was at 21.5 degrees North and 116.2 degrees East at 2 AM today. This is 1020 kilometers west of Eluanbi. It is moving northwest at 26 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Vipa's center has a pressure of 975 hectopascals. Its strongest wind near the center is 30 meters per second, with gusts up to 38 meters per second. The area with winds over 7-levels strong is 150 kilometers wide, and the area with winds over 10-levels strong is 50 kilometers wide.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong, who is also an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column "Xie Tian Ji Jiao Shi" for the Meteorological Application Promotion Foundation. He said that the newest European model shows that today, because of Typhoon Vipa's outer clouds and the monsoon, there will be some rain in central and northern Taiwan, and the temperature will be a bit high. Eastern and southern Taiwan will have heavier rain, and people should be careful about "a lot of rain" causing disasters for several days.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong said that the newest model also shows that tomorrow, because of the monsoon, there will be a lot of moisture and unstable weather. All areas might have local showers or thunderstorms, and eastern Taiwan will still have heavier rain. On July 22 and 23, the weather will still be unstable due to the monsoon. Eastern Taiwan will have clear rain. In the afternoon, mountainous areas in western Taiwan might have local showers or thunderstorms, and these might spread to some flat areas.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong pointed out that the weather changes from July 24 will depend on the "tropical system" developing within the monsoon and where it goes. We need to keep watching it.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong explained that the newest "Path Probability Forecast Map" from the Central Weather Administration and the latest European ensemble model both show that Typhoon Vipa will bring strong winds and heavy rain to Hong Kong, Macao, and the Guangdong coast today and tomorrow. Also, weather models from different countries show that another "tropical system" will slowly develop within the "monsoon circulation" starting July 23. But where it will go is very different in different models, which means there is a lot of "uncertainty."</p>
            <p>Wu Derong said that currently, 50 simulations from the European ensemble model show that the tropical system is most likely to turn north after passing east of Taiwan (about 70%). The chance of it hitting northern Taiwan is about 40%. All countries' weather models are still changing, so we should watch them closely. (Edited by Kuan Chung-wei) 1140720</p>
