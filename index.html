            <h1>Green Party Chat Group Suggests Releasing Strong News About the Disaster? Zhong Jia-bin Says: Stop Political Talk</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 24) The overflow from the Mataiâ€™an Stream landslide dam has caused serious damage. Today, some media and a former lawmaker showed messages from a chat group of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers. The messages suggested that the Executive Yuan and the DPP headquarters should release clear and strong news to help their allies, DPP lawmakers, and government officials fight back. The report gave an example of a social media page attacking Hualien County Commissioner Hsu Chen-wei.</p>
            <p>The DPP legislative group said that helping people is the most important thing, and political talk should stop. They said the chat group was discussing the real situation of the disaster. They also said that the media reports changed the original meaning of their discussions.</p>
            <p>In response, Zhong Jia-bin, the DPP legislative group's chief secretary, said in the evening that the DPP group has three rules for disaster relief: "central government takes the lead, local areas help each other, and the party supports." He said that helping people is the most important, and political talk should stop. Rebuilding homes is the most urgent task. Now, the most important thing is to give the disaster area the most help possible, including supplies and media support. He added that a lot of public discussion is not good for the people affected by the disaster. He wished good luck to Hualien.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-yu, the DPP legislative group's secretary, said in an interview that if you look at the chat messages and compare them to the news reports, everyone was talking about the real situation on the ground. They wanted to know more facts because many rumors started the night before, for example, if the Ministry of Agriculture made a mistake. They also discussed if people were being evacuated correctly.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-yu believes that the media reports left out parts and added headlines that changed the original meaning of their discussions. She also said that the DPP group was not trying to attack the Hualien County Government, but was discussing facts. Also, about the chat messages being leaked, Chen Pei-yu stressed that there might be some issues within the party group that need to be discussed, but this is not important right now. She said helping people and saving lives comes first, and they should stop all political talk.</p>
            <p>Separately, DPP lawmaker Wang Ting-yu posted on Facebook in the evening. He thanked "Mr. Kexue" for creating a picture that showed the truth, letting everyone see what Kuomintang lawmaker Fu Kun-chi was doing. He said the truth only hurts those who spread rumors.</p>
            <p>Wang Ting-yu said that the Hualien County Government was told nine times beforehand to quickly move residents out of dangerous areas. But the Hualien County Government did not take these nine warnings seriously. This led to people dying in the evacuation areas. He said these deaths could have been avoided. He also said that some people who went abroad and did nothing came back and caused problems with disaster relief, trying to blame others.</p>
            <p>Wang Ting-yu said that showing the truth is important. He said that showing the facts is for the people of Hualien, because he feels sad for them. He repeated that the truth only hurts those who spread rumors.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Internet Star's Social Media Accounts Banned After Saying He Would Donate Money if Taiwan is Attacked</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 24) Zhang Xuefeng, a famous Chinese tutor who often shares strong opinions, had his social media accounts blocked today. People can no longer follow him on these platforms. Weibo, a Chinese social media site, said it was because he broke laws or rules. On the day of China's "September 3rd military parade," Zhang Xuefeng said that if China attacked Taiwan, he would donate at least 50 million Chinese Yuan (about 125 million New Taiwan Dollars) himself.</p>
            <p>Chinese media reported that on the afternoon of September 24, new users were stopped from following Zhang Xuefeng's accounts on platforms like Douyin, Kuaishou, Weibo, Bilibili, and Xiaohongshu. Together, these accounts had more than 50 million followers. Weibo explained that "this user is banned from being followed for breaking laws and rules or the 'Weibo Community Rules'."</p>
            <p>However, Zhang Xuefeng's other related accounts were not affected. His smaller live-streaming accounts, like "Zhang Xuefeng Talks About Education Planning" on Douyin, and accounts under his company "Fengxue Weilai" are still working. Some of these accounts were even live-streaming today. This shows that the ban on following him is about his personal behavior, not his business.</p>
            <p>The reason why Zhang Xuefeng's personal accounts were all blocked at the same time has caused a lot of discussion on Chinese social media. According to news reports, Zhang Xuefeng only told reporters that "the ban on following is an account issue" before hanging up the phone.</p>
            <p>Public information shows that Zhang Xuefeng graduated from Zhengzhou University. In June 2016, he became famous online with a video titled "Seven Minutes to Understand 34 Project 985 Universities." In 2021, he started "Fengxue Weilai." This company now offers many services, including advice on education planning, improving skills, developing and planning books, internships, study trips, and live-streaming sales.</p>
            <p>As a famous online tutor, Zhang Xuefeng's words and actions have caused arguments many times and have often been trending topics.</p>
            <p>On the day of China's "September 3rd military parade," Zhang Xuefeng had hundreds of employees from his education company watch the live broadcast. After this, he said that China has these weapons not to scare others, but to unite the country.</p>
            <p>Zhang Xuefeng also said excitedly that when the country unites, on the day the first shots are fired, he would donate at least 50 million. He added that his company would always have this money, and the total donation would be at least 100 million.</p>
            <p>The video where Zhang Xuefeng said he would donate 100 million if Taiwan was attacked became very popular in China. It also caused concern and anger in Taiwan. Later, in a live broadcast, he admitted that relevant departments had reminded him to be careful about what he said and how it might affect people.</p>
