            <h1>US adds tariffs on 407 steel and aluminum products; Korea increases aid to companies</h1>
            <p>The South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy said today that the United States is putting more taxes on steel and aluminum products. So, the Korean government will give more help to its small and medium-sized companies that are affected.</p>
            <p>News from Yonhap says that starting from August 18th, the US government will add a 50% tax on 407 kinds of products made from steel and aluminum. The US had already started putting a 50% tax on all imported steel and aluminum products on June 4th.</p>
            <p>According to the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy and the Korea International Trade Association, the new list of products with added taxes includes machines, car parts, electronic devices, and home appliances.</p>
            <p>The Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy said in a press release, "To make sure our companies are hurt as little as possible, the government will greatly increase its support plans for small and medium-sized companies. This will help them deal with the import rules from Washington."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that on August 15th, the US government added more items to the list of steel and aluminum products that would have a 50% tax. This new list includes hundreds of related products and started on August 18th.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Commerce announced that evening in the Federal Register. The Bureau of Industry and Security added 407 product codes to the US import tax list. These codes help to find goods that will have extra taxes on their steel and aluminum parts.</p>
            <p>The announcement said that parts not made of steel or aluminum will have the tax rates that the US government put on goods from certain countries.</p>

            <h1>CNN: US brings H20 chips back to China; Beijing not pleased, but Chinese companies still want them</h1>
            <p>CNN reported that the US government has allowed a special kind of computer chip, the H20 AI chip from Nvidia, to be sold in China again. But China is not happy about this. They even said the chip could be a risk to their country's safety. China called Nvidia's leaders to explain and told Chinese companies not to use this chip. Even so, many Chinese companies still want to buy these chips.</p>
            <p>A few weeks ago, the US changed its rules about technology. They lifted the ban on selling H20 chips to China. After that, Beijing said the H20 chips could be dangerous for national safety. They even called leaders from Nvidia, a big AI chip company, to talk about it and asked Chinese companies to avoid using these chips.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that China's unhappy reaction shows that Beijing wants to make all its own computer parts. It also shows China's belief that its advanced chip industry is growing fast.</p>
            <p>This cool attitude from China might also be a political act. Even though China has made big steps in making computer parts, it still needs chips and technology from the US.</p>
            <p>Experts say that Huawei, a Chinese technology company, has already made chips that work as well as H20 chips, and sometimes even better. However, China still wants more advanced AI chips. The US still does not allow these very advanced chips to be sold to China.</p>
            <p>Xiang Ligang, a leader in a Beijing technology group, said that China's chip technology has grown very fast in the years since the US government, led by Donald Trump, first put limits on Huawei. This growth happened mostly because the US made more rules on exports, which made China feel more urgent to develop its own.</p>
            <p>He said, "We have the ability. It's not like they think, that China will stop working or be finished if it's blocked."</p>
            <p>For Xiang Ligang, the US's sudden change in policy shows that it is very important for China to have its own chip supply. He also said, "For Chinese companies, if we hope to make sure our chip supply is safe, it means we might only have the choice to use chips made in China."</p>
            <p>Also, China is worried that H20 chips might be a risk to national safety. They say the H20 chips might have features like "tracking location" and "remote shutdown." Some US lawmakers have asked Nvidia to add these features to their chips, but Nvidia said they do not put these features in their chips.</p>
            <p>Xiang Ligang also said that China thinks the US is not playing fair. He said, "You refuse to sell what we really want. Do you really think we are so naive that you want to sell us old products and take over our market?"</p>
            <p>Even though Beijing is worried, Chinese companies still really want these chips.</p>
            <p>Bernstein, a company that studies stocks, thinks that if there were no US export rules, Nvidia could sell about 1.5 million H20 chips to China this year. This would be about $23 billion in sales. The main buyers are big Chinese tech companies like ByteDance (which owns TikTok), Alibaba, and Tencent.</p>
            <p>Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst at Bernstein who studies China's chip industry, believes that H20 chips are appealing to Chinese companies because Huawei can only make a limited number of chips, and Nvidia has a well-developed system.</p>
            <p>He stressed that even if China wanted to use only Chinese-made chips instead of H20 chips, there are not enough of them. Bernstein thinks that Huawei will send out about 700,000 advanced chips this year, which is much less than what China needs.</p>
            <p>However, experts still say that the speed of China's progress in chip technology should not be ignored. Lin Qingyuan said that the US's tighter export rules over the years have made Beijing eager to make its own chips and has given them a chance.</p>
            <p>He said that after Huawei showed its best smartphone in 2023 with advanced chips that US officials thought were hard to make, chip manufacturing technology seemed to stop growing. But Chinese companies that make chip equipment are steadily getting better.</p>
            <p>Bernstein also predicts that the share of Chinese-made AI chips will go from 17% in 2023 to 55% in 2027. At the same time, the market share for US suppliers like Nvidia and AMD will drop a lot, from 83% to 45%.</p>

            <h1>Chinese coast guard ships often enter Diaoyutai waters; Japan monitors with "Sea Guardian" drones</h1>
            <p>According to Sankei Shimbun, Chinese coast guard ships often go into Japan's waters around the Senkaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyutai Islands). Because of this, the Japanese government has decided to use large unmanned aircraft called "Sea Guardian" (MQ-9B) from the Japan Coast Guard to watch the area. These drones are now being used.</p>
            <p>The report says that many sources said the sea around the Senkaku Islands is very big, about 4,740 square kilometers. So, they decided to use the "Sea Guardian" drones, which have the newest radar and monitoring tools. These drones will work with the patrol boats and airplanes that have pilots. This will make Japan's ability to watch the area better and make its security stronger.</p>
            <p>Since Japan bought the Senkaku Islands in 2012, Chinese coast guard ships have often sailed in that area. Since 2020, Chinese coast guard ships have appeared almost every day.</p>
            <p>Data from the Japan Coast Guard shows that in 2024, Chinese coast guard ships sailed in the area next to the Senkaku Islands for 355 days. This is 3 days more than in 2023 and is the highest number ever recorded. The Coast Guard also found that since June last year, all Chinese coast guard ships have had what looked like cannons on them.</p>
            <p>The Japan Coast Guard started using "Sea Guardian" drones in 2022. They currently have three of them. These large "Sea Guardian" drones are 11 meters long, 24 meters wide, and 4 meters tall. They can fly as high as 12,000 meters and fly for about 4,800 kilometers. They can stay in the air for 24 hours. These large drones have cameras that see heat (infrared cameras) and radar. They can be controlled from the ground to watch ships and other things.</p>
            <p>The report says that by using "Sea Guardian" drones, the Japanese government wants to show that it is trying to stop China from changing things on its own and strongly claiming the Senkaku Islands. It is still unknown if this will stop China.</p>
