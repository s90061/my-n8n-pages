            <h1>America Party on Hold? Musk Reportedly Focuses on Business, Avoids Conflict with Republicans</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported, using information from people who know about it, that the rich businessman Elon Musk is quietly pausing his plan to start a new political party in the United States. He said he wants to focus on his own companies. He also does not want to make influential Republicans unhappy by creating a new party.</p>
            <p>Elon Musk had a public disagreement with President Trump about a big law called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which was about tax cuts and spending. After that, in July, Musk announced on his social media platform X that he would create the "America Party." This party would speak for American voters who are not happy with the two main parties, the Democrats and the Republicans. He also planned for it to join the midterm elections next year.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal said that Musk has changed his mind now. According to people who know, while Musk was thinking about starting a party, he also understood that it could harm his relationship with Vice President JD Vance. Many people believe Vance could be the next leader of the "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) political group.</p>
            <p>The report also stated that some sources said Musk and his business partners told people close to them that if Vance decides to run for president in 2028, Musk would consider using his wealth to support him. In the 2024 election, Musk spent almost 300 million US dollars (about 9.1 billion NT dollars) to help Donald Trump and other Republican candidates.</p>
            <p>People close to Musk said that he has not officially given up his idea to create a new political party. They also said that he might change his mind as the midterm elections get closer.</p>
            <p>Musk and his spokesperson did not answer when asked for comments.</p>
            <p>If Musk truly gives up on creating a third political party, it would be a big success for the Republican Party before next year's midterm elections. History shows that third parties often split the votes of the two main parties. For Vance, if he really wants to become president, it will be very important to keep Musk on his side.</p>
            <p>Vance said in an interview with a conservative website called Gateway Pundit this month that it would be a bad idea to break away from Trump and the conservative movement. He stated, "So I hope that by the midterm elections, he (Musk) will join us again."</p>
            <p>There are signs that Musk and Trump are getting along well again, at least for now. They no longer argue with each other on social media. Musk has not recently written anything bad about Trump or Republicans. At the end of July, Trump wrote that he hopes Musk and his businesses will do very well, saying it is good for the country.</p>
            <p>Also, when Musk first said he would start a third political party, a Taiwanese-American businessman named Andrew Yang talked with him about the plans. But what they talked about exactly was not made public.</p>
            <p>Other people who liked the idea of a third political party have not heard anything from Musk himself.</p>
            <p>The rich technology businessman Mark Cuban recently told The Wall Street Journal in an email that he had not heard anything about a new party from Musk or his team.</p>
            <p>Someone who knows about the situation said that some of Musk's political advisors have not talked with the Tesla CEO or his close group about helping to create a political party.</p>
            <p>Steven Nekhaila, who is the chairman of the Libertarian National Committee, said he has not heard anything from Musk or his team. He also has not heard about any serious work from the rich man's friends to build a new party.</p>
            <p>He said, "It is so quiet that it is almost strange. It seems like nothing is happening, not in the states, and not among the general public."</p>

            <h1>US Government Cancels Security Clearances for 37 Current and Former Officials, Criticized as Illegal</h1>
            <p>The government of U.S. President Trump announced today that it has taken away the security permissions from 37 current and past national security officials. This is the newest action against government intelligence workers.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Tulsi Gabbard, wrote a note accusing these officials. She said they "made intelligence political or used it to harm others" to help their own goals or their party's goals. She also said they did not keep secret information safe and did not "follow the rules for analyzing spy information." She also said they did other "bad" things, but she did not say what those things were.</p>
            <p>The note did not give any proof to show these accusations were true.</p>
            <p>Many of the officials named had important national security jobs or less public roles. They left the government many years ago. Some of them worked on issues that President Trump had disliked for a long time. For example, the intelligence agencies said that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Trump win.</p>
            <p>Also, several officials signed a letter in 2019 that showed their worries about Trump. This letter was seen a lot on social media in July this year because of Laura Loomer, who is a right-wing person and a supporter of Trump.</p>
            <p>Mark Zaid, a lawyer for national security, also had his security permission taken away by the Trump government. He said in a statement: "These decisions are against the law and against the constitution. They are different from the laws and rules that have been in place for many years to prevent such things."</p>
            <p>He also said that the government's accusation that these people "made intelligence political or used it to harm others" was not honest.</p>
            <p>Gabbard defended what they did, saying that Trump told them to do it.</p>
            <p>She wrote on the social media platform X: "Having a security permission is a special right, not something everyone is automatically allowed to have. Those in the intelligence system who did not keep their promise to the Constitution, and who put their own desires before the American people, broke the important trust they promised to protect."</p>
