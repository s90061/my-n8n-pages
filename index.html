            <h1>Ukraine Attacks Russian Oil Refineries, Says Western Sanctions Must Stay</h1>
            <p>Ukraine has been attacking oil refineries in Russia more often. Reports say that since August, about 10 refineries have stopped working fully or partly. This has made Russia keep its ban on gasoline exports until the end of the year and limit some diesel exports.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian intelligence warns that if Western countries reduce their sanctions, Russia's oil industry might get strong again. This could be a danger in the war.</p>
            <p>News from Ukraine and other countries says that Ukrainian drones have attacked Russian refineries many times in the last two months. For example, the "Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat" refinery, about 1200 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, was attacked twice in late September. An oil facility in the Volgograd region has been hit 6 times this year and stopped working for a month. The big "Ryazan" facility near Moscow has also been hit 5 times since January.</p>
            <p>The Kyiv Independent reported on October 1st that Benedict George, from the energy intelligence company "Argus Media," said almost half of Russia's refineries have been attacked by Ukraine since August. He added that "oil tracking data shows Russian diesel and gasoline exports have dropped by about 30%." He explained that this is a big loss, as Russia usually exports 4 million tons of diesel each month, worth about $600 per ton (about 1.8 million New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>The "Ukrayinska Pravda" newspaper quoted Russian media saying that by September 28th, 38% of Russia's oil refining capacity was not being used, and this number kept falling, with an 18% drop in September alone.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that since January, 55% of all Russian refineries have been attacked, with attacks getting more frequent since August. Reuters noted that sometimes production has dropped by half. This has affected people's daily lives. In Crimea, many gas stations only allow commercial vehicles to get fuel. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, people have to wait in lines to get gas.</p>
            <p>Vladimir Milov, a former Russian Deputy Energy Minister now living abroad, said that Ukraine is not just attacking normal facilities. They are also hitting refineries that provide fuel to the Russian army. Experts say that from the start of the war, Ukraine has aimed at energy facilities as a key target. The recent attacks show that this strategy is working.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in September that attacking Russian oil refineries and storage facilities is the quickest way for sanctions to work. Ukraine's attacks on Russia's oil industry put more pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>Russia is one of the world's main oil producers. Oil is very important for its economy and for its military. However, Russia does not share details about the damage to its refineries. Also, Russia uses "shadow fleets" to sell oil and avoid sanctions. Because of this, it is hard to know exactly how much the attacks are hurting its economy.</p>
            <p>The US think tank, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said that to stop Russia's military, Russia needs to lose $40-50 billion (about 1.2 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). This is about three times what Russia earned from oil exports in July. Only then will there be a big impact on its economy. The CSIS suggested lowering the maximum price for Russian oil to $44 per barrel. Even if China and Turkey do not help, this could still affect 60% of Russia's exports and show results within a year.</p>
            <p>The report also suggested that the US should add taxes on oil imports from some countries that buy Russian oil, like India. This would make Russian oil less competitive and reduce Russia's profits from selling it abroad.</p>
            <p>Separately, "Ukrayinska Pravda" recently reported that Ukraine's foreign intelligence agency has information that Russia's Ministry of Economic Development believes that the price of Russian oil might grow more slowly next year. This is because there is less demand around the world and more oil is being produced in the Middle East and South America. This would put financial pressure on the Kremlin. However, the ministry also thinks that if Western countries stop their sanctions and remove Russian companies from blacklists, Russia's economy and oil industry could recover faster.</p>
            <p>On October 1st, finance ministers from the G7 group of countries said they will work together to put more pressure on Russia. They will focus on countries that keep buying Russian oil and help Russia avoid sanctions. In August, the US government placed a 50% tax on imports of Russian oil products from India because India continued to buy them.</p>

            <h1>Peng Jin-Long: New Long-Term Insurance Policies May Change How Guarantees Work</h1>
            <p>Today, the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), Peng Jin-Long, said that new long-term insurance policies could be designed to remove "long-term guarantees." However, he stressed that this does not mean removing "long-term coverage." For example, policies might set review periods of 5 or 10 years to check conditions and see if policy fees can be changed. These changes might not only be increases; they could also be decreases, for instance, if death rates go down. The goal is to create a fair system for the market.</p>
            <p>The FSC held a press conference for the Mid-Autumn Festival today, led by Peng Jin-Long, to talk about new ways to adjust rules for insurance products in the future.</p>
            <p>Peng explained that banks do not offer 30-year fixed deposits; most are for only 3 years. But insurance contracts often protect people for a very long time. If there is no clear information and not enough money saved, guaranteeing rates for 20 or 30 years is not scientific and not a good way to manage risks. Important factors like death rates, illness rates, and costs could change a lot in the future. If insurance companies make guarantees just to get more customers, their ability to continue operating could be in great danger.</p>
            <p>Peng said that the FSC wants to build a fair system. Long-term policies can be designed to remove long-term guarantees, but not long-term coverage. This idea of removing long-term guarantees is still being discussed. If it is put into practice for product design, everyone will need to talk about it together. The idea is for new long-term policies to have a "fee adjustment period," perhaps 5 or 10 years, to check conditions and see if changes can be made, based on the company's own financial health.</p>
            <p>He explained further that this adjustment might not always mean higher fees. It could also mean lower fees. For example, if the death rate goes down, life insurance policies should cost less. This is a fair way to treat the market. It is not like the stock market's circuit breaker system. He will ask the Insurance Bureau and the Insurance Institute to study this.</p>
            <p>Peng said that people see "insurance" as two things: the insurance system and the insurance contract. The government needs to manage both. For insurance contracts, the main purpose is to protect customers. If a contract does not say that fees can be adjusted, "there's nothing more to say; the company must deal with any future risks."</p>
            <p>However, from the point of view of the insurance system, Peng believes that if a product continues to operate and might harm the whole insurance system, it "might not be a good thing" if commercial insurance then leaves the market, even if individual customers are protected. So, the FSC is also thinking about how to create a system where insurance can continue to work well.</p>
            <p>Tsai Huo-Yan, the Deputy Director of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, explained that most life insurance policies are designed for many years. These policies include a fixed expected interest rate. Interest rates can change based on the country's economy. These changes might be bigger than what the companies first expected. This is why the Insurance Institute has been asked to study if it's possible to include ways to adjust the insurance amount or fees in the policy rules. The Insurance Institute is still studying this, and the FSC will look at it after receiving their findings.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, the Insurance Bureau added that for long-term policies like whole life insurance and annuities, the contract must clearly state the conditions for adjusting fees and how much they can be adjusted. If these details are not written in the contract, then the fees cannot be adjusted. Currently, only a few long-term health insurance products have this kind of design. For one-year medical insurance, if the contract says that renewal fees will follow the rates approved by the government, it means the rates can be adjusted and are not guaranteed.</p>

            <h1>Philippines Earthquake: 72 Deaths, Search Ends, Help for 20,000 People Begins</h1>
            <p>After a strong 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit Cebu Province in the central Philippines on the evening of September 30, the government announced today that search and rescue efforts have stopped. The number of people who died is now 72, and this number is not expected to go up. All missing people have been found.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the main work now is to help the people affected by the earthquake. This earthquake is the deadliest one in the Philippines in over ten years.</p>
            <p>The earthquake happened near Cebu Island on the night of September 30. It caused more than 20,000 people to lose their homes and injured more than 300.</p>
            <p>Today, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. visited Bogo City. This city has about 90,000 people and was one of the worst-hit areas. President Marcos talked to the people who had to leave their homes. He said that a lot of buildings and roads were damaged, which made it hard for rescue teams to work.</p>
            <p>President Marcos told reporters, "Our problem is that we don't have enough safe places to put families who have lost their homes, because we cannot be sure if the buildings for shelters are safe yet."</p>
            <p>He added, "We will make sure there is enough food, water, and electricity. If needed, we will send generators. We will try our best to give people whatever they need."</p>
            <p>Many people died when buildings or houses fell down. This happened either because of the earthquake itself or because of landslides that came after. Heavy rain and no electricity also made rescue work difficult.</p>
            <p>The Philippines is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is an area with many volcanoes that stretches from South America to the far east of Russia, and earthquakes happen there often. The Philippines experiences more than 800 earthquakes every year.</p>
