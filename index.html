            <h1>US Stock Market Falls as Job Data is Weak; Dow Drops Over 600 Points</h1>
            <p>New York, August 1st (CNA) â€“ The US stock market fell sharply today. The three main stock indexes dropped at least 1.5% in early trading, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 600 points. This happened because new job numbers in the US were weak, making investors worry more about the US economy. Investors were already concerned about new taxes on goods from other countries, which Washington put in place.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the US Department of Labor announced today that only 73,000 new jobs were added in July. Also, the number of new jobs in May and June was much lower than first reported. After this news, the price of US government bonds went down quickly. The stock market also expects that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates in September.</p>
            <p>About 25 minutes after the US stock market opened today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5% to 43477.54 points. The S&P 500 index went down 1.7% to 6231.49 points. The Nasdaq index fell even more, by 2.3%, to 20644.16 points.</p>
            <p>For individual companies, Amazon, a large US tech company, shared its financial outlook. This made people worry that its big investments in artificial intelligence (AI) would hurt its money. As a result, Amazon's stock price dropped 7.0% in early trading today.</p>

            <h1>Slovenia Is First in EU to Fully Stop Arms Trade with Israel</h1>
            <p>Ljubljana, August 1st (CNA) â€“ The government of Slovenia has announced that it will completely stop trading weapons with Israel. This decision is because of the war in the Gaza Strip. Slovenia says it is the first country in the European Union (EU) to do this.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the Slovenian government released a statement late yesterday. It said: "Slovenia is the first European country to stop importing, exporting, and moving weapons to and from Israel."</p>
            <p>The statement also said that Slovenia acted "alone." This is because the EU "could not take specific steps" due to disagreements and a lack of unity among its members.</p>
            <p>The Slovenian government's statement also mentioned the terrible war in Gaza. It said that "people... are dying because they are regularly stopped from getting humanitarian help." It added that "taking action is the duty of every responsible country, even if it means being ahead of others."</p>

            <h1>Huang Wei-Sheng's 4 Hits Help Brothers Beat Monkeys; Thanks Coach for Always Watching</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 1st (CNA) â€“ Huang Wei-Sheng of CTBC Brothers hit 4 singles today. Chiang Kun-Yu also had 3 hits and 4 RBIs. In the end, the Brothers won against Rakuten Monkeys by a score of 7 to 5. After the game, Huang Wei-Sheng said he was very thankful for his head coach, Hirano Keiichi. He said the coach is like a "monitor," always watching him.</p>
            <p>The game today was at Taipei Dome. The Monkeys started strong in the first inning. Chen Chen-Wei, Lin Tzu-Wei, Lin Li, and Lin Hung-Yu all hit singles, scoring 3 runs. But the Brothers scored 1 run in the second inning and 1 more in the third inning. In the fifth inning, Tseng Sung-En, Huang Wei-Sheng, and Chiang Kun-Yu hit singles one after another, scoring 2 runs. This gave the Brothers a 4-3 lead.</p>
            <p>The Brothers started scoring again in the seventh inning. After Tseng Sung-En and Huang Wei-Sheng hit singles, Wang Wei-Chen hit a sacrifice fly. Also, the left fielder Chen Chen-Wei made a mistake, which led to 1 run. Then, Chiang Kun-Yu hit another single, bringing in 2 runs. In the ninth inning, the Monkeys scored 2 runs, but the Brothers still won 7 to 5.</p>
            <p>Huang Wei-Sheng hit 4 singles in this game and was chosen as the MVP (Most Valuable Player). When asked about his hitting this year, Huang Wei-Sheng said after the game that he hit more long balls during spring training last year. But this year, at the start of the season, his rhythm was off. He said, "The hitting coaches help me look at how I hit the ball. I also go to the field early every day to practice hitting. Because I don't start every game, I hope I can play well right away when I get on the field."</p>
            <p>Brothers' head coach, Hirano Keiichi, often coaches Huang Wei-Sheng one-on-one during practice. Huang Wei-Sheng said, "I am very happy to have a coach who watches me so closely in professional baseball. He is like a monitor, always keeping an eye on me. He also tells me to get up again if I fall. He has high hopes for me, and I want to do well for him. I hope I can try hard and show him what I can do."</p>
            <p>Brothers' starting pitcher, Brandon Leibrandt, threw 95 pitches and pitched for 7 innings in this game. He gave up 8 hits, had no walks, and struck out 2 batters. He only gave up 3 runs, which was a good start, and he got his second win this season.</p>
            <p>In other news, the game today at Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium was stopped in the 6th inning because of too much rain. The Wei Chuan Dragons and TSG Hawks tied 0-0. The game between Uni-Lions and Fubon Guardians, which was supposed to be at Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium, was postponed due to rain.</p>
