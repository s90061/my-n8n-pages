            <h1>US Lawmakers Suggest Stronger Defense Partnership with Taiwan Against China's Threat</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C., August 1st, Central News Agency) This week, politicians from both parties in the US Congress introduced a new law. This law tells the US Defense Department to work with Taiwan. The goal is to make both sides' defense industries stronger. This is to help against threats from China's military technology. The law says they should work together on things like drones, computer chips, and missile systems.</p>
            <p>The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party gave a press release today. It said that John Moolenaar (Republican leader of the committee), Zach Nunn (Republican member), and Jill Tokuda (Democratic member) all put forward this law this week. It asks the US Defense Department to start a formal partnership with Taiwan.</p>
            <p>This law can be called the "U.S.-Taiwan Defense Innovation Partnership Act." The press release explained that the law wants defense companies in the US and Taiwan to work together. They will develop new things and create joint projects. This is to stop China's military technology that can be used for both military and civilian purposes.</p>
            <p>The law states that the main areas for working together include developing drones, computer chips, artificial intelligence, and missile systems.</p>
            <p>Mr. Moolenaar said that over time, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has been putting more pressure on Taiwan. He said, "This law will make our cooperation with Taiwan in important defense industries stronger. It will also make us more ready to face Beijing, which is becoming more threatening."</p>
            <p>Mr. Nunn also added that this defense partnership will be a very important way to stop attacks. He said it will "help Taiwan get new US technology faster and give Taiwan an advantage it needs to protect itself." (Editor: Chen Hui-ping) August 2, 2025.</p>

In low-lying areas, people should watch out for standing water or floods. Please be safe when you go outside.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, high temperatures in central, southern, Hualien, and Taitung areas will be around 29 to 31 degrees Celsius. Other areas will be about 33 to 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
