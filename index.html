            <h1>Slovakia Passes New Law: Limits Same-Sex Partner Rights and Stricter Rules for Changing Gender</h1>
            <p>The Slovak Parliament passed a new law today. This law limits the rights of same-sex partners and makes the rules for changing gender stricter. The new law also says that Slovak laws are more important than laws from the European Union (EU).</p>
            <p>News reports say that 90 members of the 150-member Slovak Parliament voted for this new law, and 7 voted against it. The Prime Minister, Robert Fico, who is a nationalist, said yesterday that this vote was "a very important chance to change the constitution."</p>
            <p>Since Mr. Fico became Prime Minister again in 2023, he has often disagreed with the EU. He has also caused protests in his country because he limited people's rights. Slovakia is a member of both the EU and NATO.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fico suggested this new law at the end of January. He said it would create a "constitutional defense against modern politics" and bring back "basic common sense." He said this would be done by using "the traditions, culture, and spiritual history of our ancestors."</p>
            <p>The new law says, "There are only two genders, male and female, and they are decided at birth." This is similar to what US President Donald Trump said in his speech when he started his presidency. In January, Trump promised to bring law and order back to society. He said he would stop recognizing many genders, and that from that day, the US government would only officially recognize two genders: male and female.</p>
            <p>The new law also says, "Gender cannot be changed unless there is a very serious reason. This will follow a process that will be written into law later." The law also says that only married couples can adopt children, except in a very few special cases.</p>
            <p>The Slovak constitution has said that marriage is between one man and one woman since 2014. This was also when Mr. Fico was Prime Minister. The new law states that Slovakia's "power" in "cultural and moral issues" should be more important than EU laws.</p>

            <h1>Pan Wei-chieh Scores 30 Points, Leading Chien Hsin to Beat National Chengchi University in Basketball Final</h1>
            <p>Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology, a strong team in university basketball, won against National Chengchi University today. Pan Wei-chieh led the team with 30 points, and the final score was 100 to 91. This win means Chien Hsin will play in the final game of the men's university group at the Peak Youth Basketball Tournament. Pan Wei-chieh said he wants to become a "3D player" in professional basketball.</p>
            <p>The Peak Youth Basketball Tournament is happening at the Taipei Arena. Chien Hsin, a strong UBA team, lost their first two games in the first round. They thought they would not make it to the top four teams. However, they won their last game in the first round against St. Clare College from the Philippines by a large score. This allowed them to get the last spot in the semifinals. Today, they continued their good play and beat the strong National Chengchi University team by 9 points. This put them in the final game for the men's university group.</p>
            <p>Pan Wei-chieh, who is now in his fourth year of university, scored 30 points, which was the most in the game. He also made 4 three-point shots. Wang Ding-chun scored 21 points. Together, they helped Chien Hsin win this important game. After the game, Pan Wei-chieh told reporters that he hopes to become a professional player. Because of this, he practiced more ways to attack during the summer. He focused especially on shooting from far away after a pick-and-roll. His goal is to be a "3D player," which means he is very good at shooting from outside and also plays good defense.</p>
            <p>National Chengchi University will not play in the final game. Their main player, Wu Chih-kai, accidentally hit his lip on an electronic scoreboard at the end of the game and was taken to the hospital. The head coach, Chen Tzu-wei, said that losing is not always bad. He said it can remind the players that every year is hard. He also said that he originally wanted to let players who usually don't play much get more time. But many younger players had injuries, so they had to rely on older players like Wu Chih-kai, Lin Tzu-hao, and Hsu De-chi.</p>
            <p>However, Coach Chen Tzu-wei specifically said that a new player, Hsieh Yun-da, played very well in this tournament, which was a good result. Hsieh Yun-da not only scored 19 points in this game, which was the second-highest on the team, but he also made an exciting dunk when he was tired at the end of the game. This surprised everyone, and Coach Chen Tzu-wei said he was truly shocked.</p>

            <h1>Pok√©mon Company Says US Government Immigration Video Used Their Pok√© Ball Without Permission</h1>
            <p>A recent video from the US government that was very popular online linked the Pok√©mon slogan "Gotta Catch 'Em All" to the government's actions against people who entered the country illegally. The Japanese Pok√©mon Company said today that they did not give permission for this use.</p>
            <p>Reports say that the US Department of Homeland Security put a video on X (which used to be called Twitter) this week. The video showed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) doing raids.</p>
            <p>In the video, police officers with guns and border patrol officers put handcuffs on people who were thought to be living in the country illegally. The English theme song of Pok√©mon played in the background.</p>
            <p>Many times in the video, the main character, Ash (who is called Ash in North America), throws Pok√© Balls. Pok√© Balls are tools used in the Pok√©mon games to catch and keep wild Pok√©mon.</p>
            <p>The Pok√©mon brand, which is owned by Nintendo in Japan, clearly stated that they were not involved in making or sharing the video.</p>
            <p>The Pok√©mon public relations office told news agencies in a statement, "We have never allowed anyone to use our intellectual property."</p>
            <p>This month, the US President Trump's government started a new operation in Chicago to catch immigrants. It is called "Operation Midway Blitz." They said it focuses on "the worst criminals."</p>
            <p>Pok√©mon became very popular all over the world after it first came out in 1996. The idea for Pok√©mon came from a Japanese tradition where children catch insects in the summer. Players can catch and train "pocket monsters."</p>
            <p>Now, the Pok√©mon brand includes movies, animated TV shows, and a mobile game called "Pok√©mon Go" where you can see virtual creatures in the real world.</p>
