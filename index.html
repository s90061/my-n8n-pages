            <h1>Court Says No Payment Needed in Affair Case</h1>
            <p>Xie Pohong is a leader in the People's Party. His wife said he had an affair with a junior colleague named Wang. She went to court and asked for money. The first court said he didn't have to pay. The wife appealed, but the higher court said their relationship was just like normal friends. So, the court said Xie and Wang do not have to pay. This decision is final.</p>
            <p>The court papers show that Xie's wife said in 2022, Xie Pohong helped Gao Hong-an with her election to be Hsinchu mayor. He did not come home for many days. At that time, people in the People's Party talked about Xie Pohong being with a secretary named Lin. Reporters also said they saw Xie and Lin kissing.</p>
            <p>Xie's wife said she checked their shared computer at home. She found messages between Xie Pohong and Wang, a high school club member. These messages from April to November 2022 were very playful.</p>
            <p>For example, in April 2022, Wang sent Xie a message saying, "Being with a married man is wrong, you could be sued." Xie replied, "It depends if I will be sued." In June 2022, Wang sent Xie a message saying, "I'm not in danger, you are more in danger." Xie replied, "Haha, where is the danger?" and "You almost took me home!" In November 2022, Xie sent a message saying, "I will book a hotel today, or you might mess up the dorm."</p>
            <p>Xie's wife believed that Xie Pohong and Wang were flirting on social media. She also said they stayed in a motel Xie booked after drinking. She felt this hurt her rights as a wife. She asked for 500,000 New Taiwan Dollars from Xie Pohong and Wang. The first court said Xie's wife lost. She appealed, and the higher court heard the case.</p>
            <p>The higher court looked at the messages between Xie Pohong and Wang. It said the messages were a bit lighthearted. But they were just like friends joking and talking about getting drunk. They were not beyond what people usually accept. Also, there was no proof that Xie Pohong and Wang stayed overnight in a hotel together. So, the court kept the first decision. This case cannot be appealed again.</p>

            <h1>Conductor Eschenbach Honors Seiji Ozawa's 90th Birthday with Music</h1>
            <p>September 1st is the 90th birthday of Seiji Ozawa, a famous Japanese conductor. This year, the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival has asked conductor Christoph Eschenbach to lead the Saito Kinen Orchestra for the first time. They will play Mahler's Symphony No. 2, called "Resurrection," to honor Seiji Ozawa.</p>
            <p>Composer Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2, "Resurrection," was inspired by Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. The last part of Mahler's symphony includes singing and uses many instruments. Mahler used a poem called "Resurrection" by the German poet Friedrich Klopstock for the words. This music takes listeners from darkness to light and brings a final feeling of hope.</p>
            <p>Christoph Eschenbach, who is 85 years old this year, said he was very sad when he heard that Seiji Ozawa had passed away. He said, "It is an honor for me to play a part in this. I can perform at the music festival he started, on his birthday, to show my respect."</p>
            <p>News from the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival says that Seiji Ozawa died in 2024 at 88 years old because of an illness. He was one of the most famous Japanese conductors in the world. He was the music director for the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the USA for almost 30 years. He also led the Vienna State Opera as its music director.</p>
            <p>Eschenbach explained that he and the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival talked about performing this piece. He said, "Resurrection is not just about religion; it's also about a new beginning in a deeper, philosophical way."</p>
            <p>When Taiwanese media asked Eschenbach, he said this was his first time invited to play at the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival. He shared, "In 1965, I won the Clara Haskil International Piano Competition. As part of my prize, I got to work with Seiji Ozawa in the Netherlands. That performance was very inspiring for me as a young musician."</p>
            <p>Eschenbach said Seiji Ozawa gave him many ideas and helped him understand his own music more. He added, "You could say he changed my music career." Later, Eschenbach worked with Seiji Ozawa on many of Beethoven's piano concertos. He said, "Every time we worked together, it gave me a lot of strength. Just by being there and watching how he played, I learned a lot. That is why I immediately said yes when the music festival asked me to come."</p>
            <p>The Saito Kinen Orchestra's "Resurrection" concert, which is program B, will be held on August 30th and 31st. It will take place at the Kissei Cultural Hall in Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture, Japan.</p>

            <h1>UN Plans Stronger Security Force in Haiti, But Experts Have Worries</h1>
            <p>Today, the United Nations Security Council talked about a new plan for Haiti. The plan is to make the current international force stronger and bigger. This force is fighting armed gangs. But some security experts in Haiti are worried because the plan is not clear enough.</p>
            <p>Reuters reports that armed gangs now control almost all of Port-au-Prince, the capital city of Haiti. Because of this long-term conflict, about 1.3 million people have had to leave their homes. Thousands of people have died, and many people are facing severe hunger, like a famine.</p>
            <p>This new plan was suggested by the USA and Panama. It aims to change the current "Multinational Security Support Mission." This mission does not have enough money or people. The new plan will turn it into a "Gang Suppression Force."</p>
            <p>Like the current mission, which is led by police from Kenya, the new force will also get money from other countries that want to help. But the way it is led will be different.</p>
            <p>A "Permanent Committee" will lead the new force. This committee will include countries that provide people for the force, along with the USA and Canada. A new UN office will also be set up in Port-au-Prince to help them. The Permanent Committee will choose a new leader for the force.</p>
            <p>The plan also asks the Organization of American States (OAS), a group of countries in the Americas, to keep its promise. The OAS should provide specific help, like food, ways to communicate, and defense equipment.</p>
            <p>However, some experts in Haiti have said the plan is not good. They say it doesn't clearly state where the money will come from. They also say it is too similar to what is already there and doesn't solve the main problems.</p>
            <p>Ricardo Germain, an independent security expert, said he is worried about how the leadership will change, not just the money. He also said that Kenya's difficult experience might make other countries not want to join.</p>
            <p>James Boyard, a security expert from the State University of Haiti, said the new plan is not clear enough about how it will work with local forces. He also said that Haiti is not part of the Permanent Committee, which takes away from Haiti's right to govern itself.</p>
            <p>He also said that if security workers might do something wrong, there should be a group to watch them from the start.</p>
            <p>Foreign help in Haiti has always been a sensitive topic. In the past, UN missions in Haiti caused harm to people, like deaths and sexual assault scandals. Also, poor water management led to a cholera outbreak that killed over 9,000 people.</p>
            <p>Haiti's President's office said they will comment on the plan once the official decision is made public. The US team at the UN did not answer questions about this.</p>
