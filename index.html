Oil prices around the world did not change much today. This happened because there were two main things influencing the market.

First, the United States had a lot more oil in its storage. Second, the US made new rules against Iran to stop it from selling oil easily.

West Texas oil for August increased a little by 5 cents, reaching $68.38 per barrel. Brent oil for September also went up slightly by 4 cents, to $70.19 per barrel.

**Weather Bureau Warns of Heavy Rain**

Taiwan's weather office has issued a special warning for heavy rain. A low-pressure area and winds from the southwest will bring strong, short periods of rain.

Today, places in the mountains of Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Taitung might experience very heavy rain. Other areas like Nantou, Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Lanyu could also see heavy rain.

People should be careful of lightning and strong winds. Rivers might rise quickly. In the mountains, there is a risk of landslides and mudslides. Low areas should watch out for floods.

**Bitcoin Price Reaches New High**

Bitcoin, the world's largest digital money, hit its highest price ever tonight. It almost reached $112,000.

This rise happened because more investors are willing to take chances, and big companies are buying more Bitcoin.

Reuters reported that Bitcoin went up to $111,988.90, which is its highest price ever. After that, the price went down a little to $110,922.48, but it was still 2% higher than before.
