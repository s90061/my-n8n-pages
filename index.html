            <h1>American Man Lost Wallet Before Going Home, Taipei Metro Police Helped Find It in 1 Hour</h1>
            <p>Recently, a 22-year-old American man lost his wallet while riding the Taipei Metro. He had important documents inside and was going back to the U.S. soon. He told the Taipei City Police Department's Metro Police, and they contacted staff at different stations to help find it. About one hour after he reported it, they found his wallet.</p>
            <p>The Metro Police Department said in a press release today that in mid-June, they received a report from the American man. He said that the day before, he took the metro from Taipei 101/World Trade Center Station to Gongguan Station. But it wasn't until the next day that he realized he had lost his black wallet. It had about NT$5,000 in cash, credit cards, his student ID, and other important documents.</p>
            <p>Because the American man was leaving Taiwan soon and needed his documents quickly, Officer Yuan Zhi-hong from the Metro Police's Second Team checked the information the man gave. Then, he quickly told the staff at Taipei 101/World Trade Center Station to help look for it. He also contacted other stations along the line to see if anyone had found the wallet.</p>
            <p>After many calls, the police learned that someone found a wallet at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Station that matched the American man's. They thought the American man probably lost his wallet when he changed from the Tamsui-Xinyi Line to the Songshan-Xindian Line at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Station.</p>
            <p>The metro police then went with the American man to the information desk at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Station. They checked that all the items in the wallet were there. Then, they helped him get it back. It took the metro police only about one hour to help him find his wallet after he reported it.</p>
            <p>The American man smiled and thanked the Taiwan police for their quick and professional help when he saw that everything in his wallet was safe.</p>
            <p>The Metro Police Department wants to remind everyone to keep their personal belongings in sight and pay attention when riding the metro so they don't lose anything. When changing trains, there are often many people. If you lose something by mistake, don't panic. You should immediately tell station staff, security guards, or the metro police, or call 110 to report it. The metro police will come right away to help you.</p>

            <h1>5 People Sentenced for Drug Dealing at Kaohsiung Dance Hall, Up to 4 Years and 4 Months in Prison</h1>
            <p>Staff members at the Da Di Guo Dance Hall in Kaohsiung were accused of selling drugs to customers or other staff. Ten people, including managers and assistant managers of the dance hall, were charged with crimes. After a trial at the Ciaotou District Court, five people, including a woman named Xiao, were found guilty. They were sentenced to prison for 1 year and 11 months to 4 years and 4 months. These sentences were for breaking laws about drug control. They can appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>The court's written decision from Ciaotou District Court said that all drug sales in this case were for money. The five people, including Ms. Xiao, admitted they did it to earn more money by buying and selling drugs. The judge saw that these five people admitted what they did during the investigation and trial. They also helped the police find other sources of drugs. The judge thought that they showed a good attitude after the crime. The judge considered how many drugs they sold, the amount of money, the type of drugs, who they sold to, and how they did it. So, the judge gave them sentences from 1 year and 11 months to 4 years and 4 months for selling Class 3 drugs or trying to sell Class 3 drugs together.</p>
            <p>This case started in 2023. The Ciaotou District Prosecutors Office told the police to search the Da Di Guo Dance Hall in Kaohsiung early in the morning. They found that dance hall staff were selling Class 3 drug ketamine in some private rooms to customers. They also allowed customers to use drugs in these rooms. Some of the public relations staff even used drugs with customers.</p>
            <p>At that time, the police found 18 bags of ketamine and 109 bags of drug-laced coffee in the dance hall's private rooms and staff lockers. Later, after the Ciaotou District Prosecutors Office finished their investigation, 10 people, including the managers and assistant managers of the dance hall, were charged with drug-related crimes. The Kaohsiung City Government also ordered the dance hall to close down because it broke the drug control laws.</p>
