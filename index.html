            <h1>Venus Williams to Play US Open for 25th Time, Hopes to Play Her Best and Enjoy the Game</h1>
            <p>Venus Williams, 45, will play in the US Open tennis tournament for the 25th time in her career. Today, she said she is very excited for this year's event. She added that playing on her "home ground" always feels new and exciting.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Williams is a very important player in tennis history. This might be her last time playing in the US Open women's singles. On August 25, she will play against Karolina Muchova from the Czech Republic, who is the 11th seed.</p>
            <p>Williams is currently ranked 610 in the world. After getting a special entry card from the tournament, she said she is "super excited to be back" at the US Open.</p>
            <p>She told the media, "It never gets old; it just gets more and more exciting."</p>
            <p>Williams returned to tennis in July this year, after not playing for 16 months. She won her first match at the Washington Open but lost in the second round.</p>
            <p>Williams first played in the US Open 28 years ago. In 1997, when she was 17, she reached the finals. She lost to the famous Swiss player Martina Hingis.</p>
            <p>That match made her famous. After that, she slowly became a tennis legend. She won 7 Grand Slam singles titles. She also won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister, Serena Williams.</p>
            <p>Even though she has had a great career, Williams said today that her love for tennis has not lessened at all. She said, "I love this job; it is where I find my happiness."</p>
            <p>Williams stated that she will approach her 25th US Open with a relaxed attitude. She said, "I hope to play my best. That is what I expect from myself, to play as well as I can. And that is all any player can ask of themselves."</p>

            <h1>Lu Shiow-yen Will Not Run for KMT Chairperson, Will "Stay Home" to Help Industries Through Difficult Times</h1>
            <p>Eric Chu, the chairperson of the KMT party, publicly asked Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen yesterday to take over as chairperson. Today, Lu Shiow-yen announced that she will not run for the position. She said that industries are facing very hard times. During this difficult period, she must stay in her role. She used the phrase "Mom will stay home," meaning she needs to be there for her community and local businesses.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, after the recall vote count, Eric Chu spoke at the KMT headquarters. He very sincerely asked Lu Shiow-yen to become the next KMT chairperson. He said she should take on this important responsibility. He also said that he and the party's young team would work hard and always be there to help the KMT return to power. He fully supports the KMT team led by Lu Shiow-yen to win back control.</p>
            <p>At noon, after attending an award ceremony for the Taichung Chamber of Commerce, Lu Shiow-yen spoke to reporters. She announced that she would not run for party chairperson. She wants to stay in her current job. She said, "Mom will stay home" to support local industries and the city's families during tough times.</p>
            <p>Regarding Eric Chu's request for her to take over as chairperson, Lu Shiow-yen said she appreciates his trust. However, she believes the KMT is a democratic party. So, the position of party chairperson should not be chosen by one person or decided in advance. People who want to run should be able to compete fairly.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen explained that Taiwan is facing big problems because of US tariffs. The central part of Taiwan is most affected by this economic crisis. The industries hit hardest are mechanical, precision machinery, machine tools, hand tools, and bicycles. These are mostly located in central Taiwan, especially around Taichung.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen said that these industries and manufacturers have created Taiwan's economic success for the past 50 years. If they fail, Taiwan will face a big economic downturn, serious unemployment, and it could affect the lives of millions of families.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen emphasized that this "tariff tsunami" has already started, and Taiwan's economy is getting worse. She must stay in her position to help industries and citizens' families get through this. She once said, "The harder times get, the more Mom will stay home." This is her promise, and she will keep it. Because of this, she cannot run for KMT chairperson.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen believes that even if she doesn't run for party chairperson, she will always be there if the party needs her. She has always participated in all KMT elections, big or small, and given her full effort. So, she does not need to be the chairperson to stand with everyone.</p>
