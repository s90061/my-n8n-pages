            <h1>Turkish First Lady Writes to Melania, Asks Her to Care About Gaza Children</h1>
            <p>Turkish First Lady Emine Erdogan wrote a letter to American First Lady Melania Trump today. She asked Mrs. Trump to care about the children in Gaza, just as she cared about children in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Emine Erdogan asked Melania Trump to write a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She asked Mrs. Trump to tell him to show kindness to the children in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, at a meeting between the US and Russia in Alaska, Melania Trump wrote a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In that letter, she asked President Putin to work for peace for children.</p>
            <p>In her letter to Melania, Emine Erdogan wrote, "I truly believe that your deep concern for the 648 Ukrainian children who died in the war will also extend to Gaza. In just two years, 62,000 innocent people, including 18,000 children, have been cruelly killed in Gaza."</p>
            <p>Emine Erdogan added in her letter, "As a mother, a woman, and a human being, I strongly agree with the feelings you shared in your letter. I hope you can bring the same hope to the children of Gaza, who also want peace and calm."</p>
            <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has tried to help Russia and Ukraine find peace during their war, which is now in its fourth year.</p>

            <h1>12 Migrants Go Missing After Jumping from Boat Off Balearic Islands, Spain</h1>
            <p>Spanish officials announced today that 12 migrants disappeared after jumping from a boat. They were traveling to the Balearic Islands, a popular tourist spot in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Spanish officers said 14 other migrants from the same boat were saved. They were found 58 kilometers southeast of Cabrera Island.</p>
            <p>In a statement, authorities said the rescued migrants told officers that 12 passengers jumped into the sea from the boat on August 22.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that the Spanish Civil Guard and the Coast Guard are looking for these missing people, who are from North Africa.</p>
            <p>According to data from Spain's Interior Ministry, the number of migrants coming from North Africa to the Balearic Islands has increased a lot this year.</p>
            <p>As of August 15, 4,323 migrants had arrived on these islands since the start of the year. This is 77% more than the 2,443 people who arrived during the same time in 2024.</p>
