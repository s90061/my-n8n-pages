            <h1>Taipei Nangang Sports Center Reopens, Features AI Robot to Answer Questions</h1>
            <p>The Taipei City Sports Department said today that the Nangang Sports Center is the fourth sports center to open in Taipei. After six months of repairs, it officially opened on September 3rd. Today, they held an opening event to celebrate. The center now has better sports courts, a system to prevent drowning in the swimming pool, and an AI robot that can answer questions.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei City Sports Department held the opening event for the Nangang Sports Center. It took place on the basketball court on the third floor. Li Yi-po, a former member of the boy band TOP1, hosted the event. There was also a "Energetic Cool" street dance and basketball show. Many stalls were set up for people to join in the fun.</p>
            <p>The Sports Department said the Nangang Sports Center closed in March for six months of repairs. It had a trial opening for seven days from August 27th to September 2nd, and over a thousand people tried it out. It officially started operating on September 3rd, and today's event celebrated its reopening.</p>
            <p>After the repairs, both the services and the facilities are better. For services, the Sports Department said there is now a special digital AI smart service area, the only one in Taiwan. An AI robot can answer questions about the center, ticket prices, and news about events. At the entrance, there are also self-service machines where people can quickly buy tickets, sign up for classes, and rent spaces. It also works with U-Sport sports coupons and U-coin points for easy service.</p>
            <p>For facilities, the Sports Department said the swimming pool now has an AI system to prevent drowning. It also uses an electrolytic salt filter system instead of the old chlorine system. This helps reduce the smell of chlorine and the risk of allergies. The new classrooms have updated floors and air conditioning.</p>
            <p>The basketball court now has a new maple wood floor. The badminton courts use special sports mats approved by the Badminton World Federation (BWF). The gym has all new weightlifting equipment and new exercise mats. The whole center uses UV and ozone to kill germs and has good air circulation to keep the air clean.</p>
            <p>For sports classes, they have added Pilates with machines, which is very popular now. The shooting range has new electronic targets and other equipment. All the showers and toilets in the center are also new. The center now offers a good, varied, and safe place to exercise.</p>

            <h1>Trump Wants to Take Back US Military Base in Afghanistan, Taliban Official: Not an Inch Will Be Given</h1>
            <p>Today, an official from the Taliban government in Afghanistan said that Afghanistan will not give back any land. They will not make a deal with the United States. This was in response to former US President Trump saying he wants to take back Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Bagram Air Base is the biggest air base in Afghanistan. It is north of Kabul, the capital city. The US military used this base for important actions during the 20-year war in Afghanistan against the Taliban. But American soldiers left the base four years ago.</p>
            <p>Recently, Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. He said that the US built Bagram Air Base. He warned that if Afghanistan does not give it back, bad things will happen. Trump also told the media that the US is talking with Afghanistan about this issue.</p>
            <p>Fasihuddin Fitrat, who is the Chief of Staff of the Afghan armed forces, said today: "Recently, someone said that they have started talks with Afghanistan to take back Bagram Air Base."</p>
            <p>Fitrat added: "It is impossible to make a deal, not even for one inch of Afghan land. We do not need a deal."</p>

            <h1>To Save from Low Birth Rate, Chen Shih-chung Plans to Promote Temporary Childcare and 'Three-in-One' Child Rearing Facilities</h1>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung, a minister without portfolio in the Executive Yuan, said that to help with the low birth rate, the next step is to create "temporary childcare" services for children under 12. They also plan to set up "three-in-one" childcare places. These places will combine infant care centers, kindergartens, and primary schools. The goal is to make it easier for parents to raise children.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that in 2015, Taiwan had 213,000 babies born. After that, the number kept going down. Last year, only 134,000 babies were born, and this year the number is still falling. The Executive Yuan recently approved three "Good Pregnancy" plans. These include a NT$100,000 birth subsidy, an updated IVF subsidy (3.0), and help for keeping fertility for medical reasons.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung attended a thank-you tea party for the 25th anniversary of the Taiwan Medical Reform Foundation today. After the event, he spoke to the media. When asked about how the "Good Pregnancy" plans would help with the "national security problem" of low birth rates, he said the main goal now is to stop the birth rate from falling. Then, they will slowly improve policies for childcare, housing, and workplaces that are friendly to parents. This will help Taiwan's birth rate go up little by little.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung mentioned recent announcements about housing for married couples and rental subsidies. These include social housing where people can live for up to 12 years and changes to rental rules. All these plans aim to help young couples have a stable place to live. The next step is to make childcare policies better. The government will work hard to create "temporary childcare" services. This is very important for families where both parents work.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung explained that when parents have something sudden to do, they need a safe place to leave their children. The government will bring together related platforms from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Since children under 12 cannot be left alone at home, temporary childcare will mainly be for children aged 0 to 12. This will help reduce stress for parents.</p>
            <p>Also, the government will promote "three-in-one" childcare places. Chen Shih-chung said that they want to combine infant care centers, kindergartens, and primary schools in one place. For example, they could put infant care and kindergarten facilities inside a primary school.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung said that these "three-in-one" childcare places will help parents with two or three children. They will not have to travel to different places to pick up and drop off their children. In the future, they will start by creating these services in areas where there is not enough childcare. They want to slowly create a full childcare service for children aged 0 to 12.</p>
