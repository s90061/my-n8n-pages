            <h1>Water Level Rises in Nantou Maoluo River, Xu Shuhua Asks Cars to Move from Low Areas</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Zheng Weizhen, Nantou, August 3) Heavy rain has fallen in Nantou County for many days. This has caused loose soil and rocks in many places. Road TOU-54, at the 13.4-kilometer mark, near Puji Bridge, is damaged and might collapse. It is now closed. People going between Jiji and Shuili can use Provincial Highway 16 instead. Also, the water level in the Maoluo River is rising. People are asked to move their cars from low-lying areas.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration said that strong, short rains are likely because of the southwest airflow. Today, some mountain areas in Nantou County will have heavy or very heavy rain. Other parts of Nantou County will have heavy rain. The rain forecast at 10 AM showed that mountain areas in Nantou could get 100 to 190 millimeters of rain in the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p>Nantou County Mayor Xu Shuhua said on Facebook this morning that the Maoluo River's water level is now high. She has asked the Nantou City Office to tell local leaders (village chiefs) to make stronger announcements. These announcements are to tell people to move cars from under elevated bridges and low areas. Warning lines have been put up, and water pumps are still working.</p>
            <p>Xu Shuhua also said that there are falling rocks at the 28-kilometer mark of Road TOU-89. The Shanslinxi Highway has had landslides and cannot be used. She has asked contractors to help clear the roads.</p>
            <p>The Jiji Township Office said that at the 13.4-kilometer mark of Road TOU-54, before Puji Bridge, the road base has big cracks and has sunk. It could collapse at any time. This part of the road is now closed. People going from Shuili to Jiji can use Provincial Highway 16. However, Provincial Highway 16, at the 12-kilometer mark, had a landslide a few days ago. So, traffic there is only allowed in one direction. (Edited by Li Shuhua) August 3, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Expert: Kang Ding Warship Gets New Missile System and Radar, Can See Farther and Attack Faster</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter You Kaixiang, Taipei, August 3) Taiwan's Navy Kang Ding-class ships have been updated. They now have the Huayang Vertical Launch System (VLS) made by CSIST, along with Sea Sword II missiles. An expert said today that compared to the old Sea Chaparral missiles, the Sea Sword II missiles can fly much farther. Also, the VLS does not need to move up, down, left, or right to aim at enemies. It can launch missiles very quickly, one after another. The new rotating radar gives a 3D view of the battlefield. This means the ships can see enemies from far away, aim accurately, and react quickly.</p>
            <p>To make its military stronger, the Navy has set aside NT$43.1599 billion (about US$1.4 billion) from 2022 to 2030. This money will be used to improve the fighting systems of six Kang Ding-class ships (also called Lafayette-class frigates) in the Navy's 124th Fleet. The first ship to be updated, the Chen De, left port for the first time on the morning of July 28 to test its new systems at sea. It is expected to finish its updates and be ready for duty by the end of this year. Starting next year, one ship will be updated each year until all are finished, making the Navy stronger.</p>
            <p>The updates for the Kang Ding-class ships include better anti-aircraft missiles, battle control systems, detection systems, towed sonars, and missile systems. For the missile system, the ships used to have Sea Chaparral short-range anti-aircraft missiles. After the update, they will have the "Huayang" Vertical Launch System (VLS), which was developed by CSIST. This VLS can carry 32 Sea Sword II (TC-2N) anti-aircraft missiles.</p>
            <p>The VLS at the front of the ship has 8 units. Each unit can hold 4 Sea Sword II missiles. Su Tzu-yun, an expert from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said that the Sea Chaparral missile could only fly about 8 kilometers. But the Sea Sword II missile can fly about 30 to 40 kilometers, which is a careful guess. Also, there are more Sea Sword II missiles, and they launch faster. When fighting, the VLS does not need to move to aim, like the Sea Chaparral missile. Instead, it can launch in a second, then turn towards the target area. It can even fire many missiles one after another. This makes its fighting power much better than the Sea Chaparral.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kang Ding ships have new Type 997 rotating array radars from the British company BAE Systems. This greatly improves their ability to find things. Su Tzu-yun explained that the Kang Ding ships' old radars were 2D. But the new radar is 3D. This means it can find targets, their distance, and their height. This gives the Kang Ding ships a 3D picture of the battle. According to public information, it can "lock onto and track" more than 200 targets at the same time. So, it can see farther and more accurately, and react faster.</p>
            <p>The Kang Ding-class frigates were first built as France's Lafayette-class frigates. They belong to the Navy's 124th Fleet, and their home port is Zuoying Naval Base. Their main jobs are air defense, anti-submarine warfare, escorting ships, stopping blockades, and working with other ships to stop enemies on the water. There are currently 6 ships: Kang Ding (PFG-1202), Xining (PFG-1203), Kunming (PFG-1205), Dihua (PFG-1206), Wuchang (PFG-1207), and Chen De (PFG-1208). (Edited by Lin Shuyuan) August 3, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Guangxi Mercedes Driver Shows ID to Force Way, Special Treatment Causes Public Anger</h1>
            <p>(CNA, Taipei, August 3) A man in Guangxi recently posted a video. It showed that a woman driving a Mercedes-Benz forced him to yield by "showing an ID." The woman also knew his personal information. The man thought a public official was misusing power. Today, officials released their investigation results. They said the woman used her husband's "administrative enforcement ID" to scare the man. Media comments said this "showing off special rights" is a big problem and has turned a simple argument into a big national news story.</p>
            <p>On July 22, Mr. Li was driving in Fangchenggang City, Guangxi, and met a Mercedes-Benz car. The woman driving the Mercedes showed an ID that said "administrative enforcement" to force him to move. The man with her (who was the woman's father) even used Mr. Li's license plate to say his home address and last name out loud, which are private details.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li believed that a public official used their power to get his private information. He was very angry and complained. But the police did not come to handle the situation. So, he posted short videos about it online. These videos were watched more than 10 million times.</p>
            <p>On July 31, police from the local station came to Mr. Li's home late at night. They said his videos showed the woman driver's license plate and violated her privacy. They asked him to delete the videos and say sorry. He deleted the first videos but then posted them again with parts hidden. This made people pay attention again.</p>
            <p>At first, the police said they could not share if the woman was a public official. But after many people complained, they announced that a special team was set up to check the matter.</p>
            <p>Today, the investigation team from Fangchenggang City in Guangxi, made up of city committee and government members, announced the results. They said the 28-year-old woman driving the Mercedes-Benz, Ms. Hou, is not a public official herself. Her husband is a Level 2 firefighter at a fire rescue station in Shangsi County, Fangchenggang City. The "administrative enforcement ID" Ms. Hou showed was her husband's. She showed it to scare Mr. Li.</p>
            <p>The police are now looking into Ms. Hou's actions and the bad effect they had online. Her husband, Mr. Li, did not keep his ID safe, which led to it being used illegally. This is against work rules. The Fangchenggang City Fire Rescue Detachment has started an investigation into him.</p>
            <p>About Mr. Li's concern that his personal information was shared, the report said that Ms. Hou's family lives near Mr. Li's parents' home. They know each other. But Mr. Li has worked in another city for many years and did not know this. When the car argument happened, Ms. Hou's father, who was with her, got out of the car. He recognized Mr. Li, so he said Mr. Li's family address and other personal details at that time.</p>
            <p>The report stressed that Ms. Hou and her father do not have "police communication devices" or other tools that police or government workers use to look up people's information. So, they did not look up Mr. Li's information on the spot.</p>
            <p>Pengpai News, a Chinese media, said today that even the administrative enforcement ID of a Level 2 firefighter at a town fire station could be used by his wife to scare someone. This shows that the idea of "showing off special rights" still exists in some areas and is very strong. "Even a very small amount of power is used to its fullest."</p>
            <p>This event also makes people question if the police handled the situation and responded to everyone in a proper way. The comment said that in the age of social media, this "showing off special rights" can become very big when people across the country pay attention. Then, it turns into a national news event, causing a lot of damage to the local area's image. This is a big lesson from this event. (Edited by Chen Kaiyu) August 3, 2025.</p>
