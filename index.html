            <h1>Mid-Autumn Festival: Discount on Postage for Packages Sent to Soldiers on Remote Islands</h1>
            <p>The Chunghwa Post company announced today that they will give a special offer for the Mid-Autumn Festival. This is to show respect to the soldiers working in places like Kinmen, Matsu, Dongyin, Wuqiu, Nansha Islands, and Dongsha Islands. From September 18th to 26th, people can send packages to these soldiers with a 20% discount on postage.</p>
            <p>Chunghwa Post said in a press release that during this time, if you send clothes, daily items, and food that doesn't spoil easily to these soldiers, the postage will be 20% cheaper. This discount does not include special fees like insurance.</p>
            <p>However, this discount does not apply if you send packages using convenience boxes/bags, iPost boxes for pick-up, self-service pick-up, post office hold, or multiple items to one address.</p>
            <p>To keep packages safe, Chunghwa Post asks people to use postal boxes or their own strong boxes for sending. Make sure the box is well-sealed and strong enough.</p>
            <p>Chunghwa Post also reminds people to write clearly on the package cover with a pen that won't fade. Write the special mailbox number for the recipient's service area (do not write the army unit name or number), the postal code, and the recipient's name. If the package contains food, please write "FOOD" on the cover so the post office can handle it carefully.</p>

            <h1>Wang Ting-yu Not Charged After Posting Trip Details on Facebook</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 28 (CNA) â€“ Member of the Legislative Yuan, Wang Ting-yu, has not been charged. He was accused of sharing national secrets after he posted about a trip to France on Facebook in 2018. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office looked into the case and decided that the trip was not a secret. So, they decided not to charge Wang Ting-yu today.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee went on a trip abroad from July 23rd to 31st, 2018. Wang Ting-yu posted on Facebook about it. He wrote things like, "Secret military trip, leaving soon, see you in ten days," "First day of the secret defense trip in Europe," and "Now at a military base in eastern France, about to take the high-speed rail back to Paris."</p>
            <p>Some people reported that Wang Ting-yu shared the places and details of this trip with many other people. They said he might have broken laws about protecting national secrets and sharing non-military secrets.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office asked the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense Naval Command for documents showing if the trip was classified as secret. The Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee only replied repeatedly that "the second agenda for the overseas trip of this committee in the 5th session of the 9th term was carried out according to the instructions of Conveners Wang Ting-yu and Lu Yu-ling."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense Naval Command clearly stated, "Our military did not take part in the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee's trip to France in July 2018. Therefore, we do not have any secret classification levels or document numbers to provide for the case."</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office believes that the trip was not officially classified as secret according to the National Security Information Protection Act or other laws. It was also not considered a defense secret. Therefore, what Wang Ting-yu did is not a crime under the law about sharing non-military secrets. This is why Wang Ting-yu was not charged.</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Warns Consumers About "Free" Music Editing App Charges</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 28 (CNA) â€“ Many people have been charged NT$6,990 after subscribing to an AI music editing app that promised a "0-dollar limited-time offer." The Legal Affairs Department says they have received over ten complaints about these subscription issues. They warn that these apps are often run by companies outside Taiwan, which makes it hard to solve problems. Consumers should be careful.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Legal Affairs Department released news today that AI music editing apps are popular. They often use "0-dollar limited-time offers" to get people to download them. People have reported that they downloaded the app because it was free, but then they were charged NT$6,990. After checking reviews from other users, they found that many people had the same problem and felt cheated.</p>
            <p>Taipei consumer protection officers said that these apps use low prices, like "0-dollar downloads" or "free trials," to attract users. After downloading, if you want to use other features, you need to pay extra. If you don't cancel your subscription before the trial period ends, it automatically renews, and you get charged through your credit card or phone bill.</p>
            <p>Consumer protection officers say that if you don't want to keep the subscription, just deleting the app is not enough. You must complete the cancellation process during the trial period to avoid problems. The Legal Affairs Department has received more than ten similar complaints about extended subscriptions so far.</p>
            <p>The Legal Affairs Department looked at the reasons for these ten-plus complaints. They found that the automatic renewal rules for these apps are often hidden in the terms of service. For example, when the contract ends, it renews automatically without the consumer agreeing again. Also, it is difficult and unclear how to cancel the subscription, and customer service is hard to reach or can't solve problems well. This leads to consumer disputes.</p>
            <p>The Legal Affairs Department also said that some of the terms of use and privacy policies for these apps are only in English. Many people agree to the terms and use the app without reading them carefully. They also don't notice the deadline to cancel the subscription, which causes them to be charged money for no reason.</p>
            <p>Consumer protection officers explained that these apps often have ongoing contracts. The companies use automatic renewal and automatic charges through credit cards or phone numbers. Since most of these app developers are outside Taiwan, it is harder to discuss or mediate consumer complaints within Taiwan. This means these types of transactions have a higher risk for consumers.</p>
            <p>If people have questions about consumer issues, they can check the Taipei City Legal Affairs Department's consumer protection website or call the consumer service hotline at 1950 or the citizen hotline at 1999 ext. 7812.</p>
