Taiwan's central bank has warned that the United States' rapidly increasing national debt could affect global trust in U.S. Treasury bonds. This concern was highlighted in a report by the central bank, noting that while the U.S. dollar and Treasuries remain important for global finance, the continued accumulation of debt could pose risks. Taiwan, holding over 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasuries, is closely watching these developments. The central bank emphasized that this situation raises questions about the debt's long-term sustainability and its potential impact on international financial markets.

**Taiwan Railway Fares to Increase, New Refund Policy for Delays**

Starting tomorrow, June 23rd, Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares will see their first increase in 30 years, with an average rise of 26.8%. Along with passenger tickets, fees for luggage, parcels, and Taiwan PASS rail products will also go up. Additionally, the free travel distance for electronic payment cards like EasyCard and iPASS will be reduced from 70 kilometers to 50 kilometers. However, there's good news for passengers experiencing delays: if a train is more than 10 minutes late, travelers can now get a full refund without any service fees.

**Chinese Tugboat 'United Offshore 5001' Enters Taiwan Waters Undeterred**

A large Chinese tugboat, "United Offshore 5001," reportedly entered Taiwan's territorial waters without any apparent obstruction from authorities. It is unclear what the tugboat was transporting. The Hengchun Coast Guard Patrol team's PP3559 vessel allegedly received no signal from the vessel and took no further action. Taiwan ADIZ (Air Defense Identification Zone) has issued a warning, expressing concern about the unknown motives of the "United Offshore 5001," especially regarding the possibility of it towing large military weapons or engaging in "gray zone" incursions that could damage Taiwan's underwater cables. Taiwan ADIZ urges rigorous monitoring and interception for inquiry.
