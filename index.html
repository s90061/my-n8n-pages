            <h1>Naomi Osaka Beats Kasatkina, Moves to US Open Round of 16 to Play Gauff</h1>
            <p>Former US Open women's singles champion Naomi Osaka won a tough 3-set match against Australian player Daria Kasatkina today. This is the first time in five years she has reached the fourth round of the US Open. Next, she will play against the new American star Coco Gauff.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Naomi Osaka last reached the fourth round of the US Open in 2020. That year, she went on to win the women's singles title. Today, she took advantage of the 15th seed Kasatkina's weak serves. Osaka won the match with scores of 6-0, 4-6, 6-3.</p>
            <p>This win is her best performance in a Grand Slam singles tournament since she had a baby in 2023 and returned to playing last year.</p>
            <p>She said, "This journey has been very long, but I am happy to be here now." This will be the first time Naomi Osaka has reached the second week of a Grand Slam tournament since she won the Australian Open in 2021.</p>
            <p>Naomi Osaka said she is excited to play against Coco Gauff, who won the US Open women's singles title in 2023. Osaka sees Gauff as her "sister."</p>
            <p>When talking about her upcoming match with Gauff, Naomi Osaka joked to the audience, "Can anyone come watch this match and cheer for me? Because it's a bit hard to play against an American here."</p>
            <p>The 3rd seed, Gauff, played much better today after some difficult earlier rounds. She easily beat Polish player Magdalena Frech in two straight sets to reach the US Open women's singles Round of 16.</p>
            <p>On August 28th, Gauff had a very tough match against Croatian player Donna Vekic. She even cried during that match. But today, she played her best at the US Open. It only took her 1 hour and 13 minutes to win 6-3, 6-1 against the 28th seed, Frech.</p>

            <h1>Yemen's Houthi Group Vows Revenge After Prime Minister, Other Officials Die in Israeli Air Strikes</h1>
            <p>A news agency run by Yemen's Houthi group reported today that Mahdi al-Mashat, a leader of the Supreme Political Council, stated that the Houthi government's prime minister and several other ministers died in Israeli air strikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The group has promised to get revenge.</p>
            <p>The report said that the attacks on August 28 also hurt many people, but it did not give more details.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army also confirmed tonight that they killed Ahmed al-Rahawi, the Houthi government's prime minister, and other high-ranking officials.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Israel yesterday announced that these air strikes were aimed at top Houthi officials, such as the chief of staff and defense minister, of the group that is connected to Iran.</p>
            <p>However, al-Mashat's statement did not say if the Houthi defense minister was among those killed or injured.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, al-Mashat released a video on the Telegram messaging app. In it, he said, "We promise Allah, the dear people of Yemen, and the families of the martyrs and injured that we will get our revenge."</p>
            <p>He also warned foreign businesses to leave Israel soon, "before it is too late."</p>
            <p>Al-Rahawi became prime minister almost a year ago. But the real leader of the government is his deputy, Mohamed Moftah. Moftah was named acting prime minister today.</p>
            <p>Al-Rahawi was mostly seen as a leader in name only and was not a main member of the Houthi leadership.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said that its fighter jets attacked a place in the Sanaa area where high-ranking Houthi officials were meeting. They called the attack a "complex operation" that succeeded because of good information gathering and air power.</p>
            <p>Israeli security sources said on August 28 that the attacks targeted several places where many Houthi officials had gathered to watch a TV speech by their leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi.</p>
            <p>The Houthi group, which is linked to Iran, has attacked ships in the Red Sea. They said they did this to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>They also fired missiles at Israel, but most of these were stopped. In response, Israel then attacked areas in Yemen controlled by the Houthi group, including the important port of Hodeidah.</p>

            <h1>Sinkhole Swallows Roads and Railway in Norway, One Worker Dies</h1>
            <p>Authorities in Norway said today that a huge sinkhole appeared in an area north of the capital, Oslo. The ground gave way, and part of a highway and a railway track were swallowed. One person died because of this.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, photos in Norwegian media show that the sinkhole is tens of meters wide. It affected both sides of the E6 highway and the railway tracks next to it in the town of Levanger. This town is about 500 kilometers north of Oslo, Norway's capital.</p>
            <p>Norwegian police said in a statement that a Danish worker who went missing at the accident site is now believed to be dead.</p>
            <p>The state-owned company that manages Norway's railway system told the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) that they were working to make the soil stronger along the railway tracks before this happened.</p>
            <p>The company stated that it is too early to say if this work to strengthen the soil caused the sinkhole.</p>
            <p>The Norwegian News Agency (NTB) reported that experts said the soil in the accident area is mostly made of clay. This type of soil can sometimes cause sinkholes to happen.</p>
            <p>Authorities have moved people out of two houses near the accident site.</p>
            <p>The Norwegian Road Administration announced that the E6 highway around the accident area will be closed for several days.</p>
