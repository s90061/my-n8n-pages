Reports say that the "Outstanding Youth Delegation" has been taking Taiwanese university students to China for over 20 years. However, recent trips reportedly include political activities and stop students from asking difficult questions.

Taiwan's Ministry of Education is looking into the group's connection with a Chinese organization. This Chinese organization is linked to a political group in China. If the "Outstanding Youth Delegation" is found to have broken Taiwan's law about relations with China, they could be fined between NT$100,000 and NT$500,000. They might also get more fines if they keep doing it.

The Ministry of Education also told students to be careful when they travel to China, Hong Kong, and Macau because of potential dangers. Travel warnings for these areas were recently raised. Schools and students participating in exchange programs should register their trips.

IBTS Financial Holding is planning to raise NT$5 billion in new money. They said that their financial health is near a warning level, so they need to get more money to keep their good credit rating. They plan to increase their capital by NT$3 billion.

Their subsidiary, Rakuten Bank, is expected to lose a total of NT$3 billion by the end of this year. Because of this, it is very important and urgent for them to raise more money for Rakuten Bank.

This is only the second time IBTS Financial Holding has raised capital in 20 years. Some people worry that this might reduce the value of shares for other investors, but the company states that the amount for specific investors is small. Other online banks in Taiwan have also raised money when their losses were similar. This plan needs approval from their board and the financial authority.
