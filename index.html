            <h1>Typhoon Kajasa Causes 2 Deaths, 30 Missing, 28 Injured; Matai'an Stream Bridge Broken, Road Authorities Plan New Routes</h1>
            <p>The sea warning for Typhoon Kajasa ended tonight. The Central Emergency Operation Center reported a total of 221 disaster events across Taiwan. These events caused 2 deaths, 30 people missing, and 28 people injured. Because the Matai'an Stream Bridge was broken, the Highway Bureau has planned new routes for drivers.</p>
            <p>In Hualien County, a dammed lake at Matai'an Stream overflowed this afternoon. A large amount of floodwater broke the Matai'an Stream Bridge. Guangfu Township suffered serious flooding. The Central Emergency Operation Center for Typhoon Kajasa held its ninth meeting and intelligence review tonight.</p>
            <p>The National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction said that it will continue to rain in the Matai'an Stream area until tomorrow morning. Water level monitoring shows that the water levels at Jianying Bridge and Hualien Bridge are slowly going down. Relevant government units will continue to watch the situation.</p>
            <p>Regarding the overflowing dammed lake at Matai'an Stream, the disaster monitoring and search and rescue team said that a command center has been set up at the Hualien Tourism Sugar Factory. The Hualien County Fire Department sent 87 vehicles and 180 people to help.</p>
            <p>Other cities and counties also sent help: Taitung County Fire Department (8 vehicles, 4 boats, 23 people), Pingtung County Fire Department (8 vehicles, 5 boats, 22 people), New Taipei City Fire Department (27 vehicles, 3 boats, 68 people, 2 search dogs), Yilan County Fire Department (5 vehicles, 5 boats, 18 people), and Taipei City Fire Department (2 vehicles, 6 people). In total, there were 50 vehicles, 17 boats, 137 people, and 2 search dogs.</p>
            <p>Statistics from the disaster monitoring and search and rescue team show that as of 7 PM tonight, there were 221 disaster events across the country. These caused 2 deaths, 30 people missing, and 28 people injured. In Guangfu Market, Hualien County, a woman who was holding onto a pillar was rescued.</p>
            <p>The two people who died were a 55-year-old man named Zhou from Guangfu Township, Hualien County, who died this afternoon at 4 PM for unknown reasons; and an 80-year-old man named Huang, also from Guangfu Township, Hualien County, who likely died of natural causes at 4 PM.</p>
            <p>Also, the Hualien County Fire Department received 506 phone calls from 3 PM to 8 PM tonight. 215 of these calls became official cases. They also received 109 reports from the police, and 75 of these became official cases. In total, there were 290 cases.</p>
            <p>The agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry team said that the Matai'an Stream dammed lake overflowed and broke at 2:30 PM. At 3:30 PM, the first big flood wave arrived and destroyed the Matai'an Stream Bridge. At 4:30 PM, the second big flood wave arrived. Based on the flooding downstream, about 60 million tons of water flowed out.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency will continue to check all monitoring data and information. When the weather allows and it is safe, they will immediately send people to take aerial photos. This will help with later recovery work.</p>
            <p>Also, the Hualien branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency has prepared people and equipment for later emergency repair work. The monitoring team thinks there are still about 31 million tons of water in the dammed lake. The Central Weather Administration expects about 200 millimeters of rain in the next 12 hours, and more sand and soil will continue to flow out. People doing repair work near the river should be careful for their safety.</p>
            <p>The transportation engineering team said that because of the dammed lake overflowing, all Taiwan Railways Taitung Line trains will stop running before 12 AM tonight.</p>
            <p>Also, if the water is not gone by tomorrow morning, the section between Wanrong and Guangfu will be closed. There will be alternative plans: Eastern Main Line trains going south will go to Hualien Station; trains going north will go to Yuli Station (local trains will go to Ruisui if possible). For bus transfers, the route will be "Fenglin Station" - Highway 46 - Jianying Bridge - Highway 193 - Highway 11A - "Guangfu Station" - Highway 11A - Highway 193 - "Ruisui Station".</p>
            <p>The transportation engineering team mentioned that because the Matai'an Stream Bridge broke, the Highway Bureau has planned a new route: Highway 9 - Highway 11C - Highway 11 - Highway 30 (Yuchang Highway), and then back to Highway 9. They will explain the repair plan to the public by noon tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The water and electricity support team said that the Water Resources Agency sent 46 heavy machines, 19 water pumps, and 87 people to help Guangfu Township in Hualien County at 4 PM. They also sent people to Guangfu area to take aerial photos to provide real-time disaster information.</p>
            <p>In addition, 14,017 homes across Taiwan had no electricity, and 2,015 homes still need power to be fixed. In Hualien County, 2,871 homes had no electricity, and 1,696 homes still need power to be fixed. 4,378 homes in Taiwan had no water (all in Hualien County). After the water goes down, they will fix these problems quickly.</p>
            <p>For the disaster areas, there are currently 51 flooded areas across Taiwan. Water has not gone down in 46 areas (Guangfu Township and Fenglin Township in Hualien County). Water has gone down in 5 areas (Hualien City and Fuli Township in Hualien County, and Taitung City and Taimali Township in Taitung County).</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense said that the military has 27,875 soldiers ready, and 3,853 vehicles and machines of 42 types. All are prepared. The soldiers sent today have arrived as ordered and are helping with disaster relief work based on what local governments need.</p>
            <p>The commander, Minister of Interior Liu Shih-fang, finally announced that the Central Emergency Operation Center will stay at Level 1 until noon tomorrow. This flood has damaged public buildings and people's homes in the city. She asked all government departments to actively work on tasks like rescuing people, fixing electricity, moving supplies, cleaning up the environment, getting transportation back to normal, making sure communication works well, and sharing disaster information. This will help the people of Hualien get back to their normal lives quickly.</p>
            <p>Liu Shih-fang said that to make the emergency repair work after the disaster go smoothly, the Ministry of Agriculture should work with other government departments to set up a forward coordination center. Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lai Chien-hsin will be the main coordinator. This center will work with the Hualien County Government's forward command center to speed up future response and recovery work.</p>

            <h1>Director Tsai Ming-liang Says "Home" Was a Happy Surprise and Will Film "Walker" Series in Korea</h1>
            <p>Director Tsai Ming-liang's new film "Home" was shown at the Busan International Film Festival. After the screening, he shared that this film was an unexpected happy surprise that was not planned. He was so excited after finishing the film that he could not sleep. Tsai Ming-liang also said that next year, he will film his "Walker" series of movies in Korea.</p>
            <p>This year, Tsai Ming-liang brought his film "Goodbye, Dragon Inn" and his new film "Home" to the Busan Film Festival. Many fans bought tickets to watch them. After the screenings, he excitedly shared how he makes films and his thoughts about movies. He also kindly signed autographs for all the audience members.</p>
            <p>"Home" is 65 minutes long. Tsai Ming-liang went to Laos, his actor Anong Houngheuangsy's hometown, by himself with one video camera and one still camera. He filmed for more than two weeks and took pictures of over 100 houses.</p>
            <p>"I asked Anong to take me around, and I was immediately drawn to the houses in their villages," Tsai Ming-liang said. He noted that the houses in Laos had a "special feeling." They were made with natural materials like wood and cement. "The most interesting thing was that many houses were empty. Some were being built, some were being fixed, and some were completely broken." Many young people in Laos, like Anong, go to other countries to earn money and send it home to fix their houses.</p>
            <p>In one scene in the film, Tsai Ming-liang saw a dog stuck in the middle of a ride at an amusement park. The dog was surrounded by spinning seats and could not get out. "I felt this was like Anong's situation; their lives are not easy to escape from that trap," Tsai Ming-liang said. He mentioned that people in Laos work very hard but are also very hopeful. He found their overall atmosphere very interesting. "So, I will go back and film them again."</p>
            <p>Many reporters and audience members were curious why Tsai Ming-liang made "Home." They wondered if it was connected to his "Walker" series or if it marked the end of the series. Tsai Ming-liang explained that his reason for making "Home" was simple: he met Anong, had the chance to go with him back to Laos, and then made this unexpected film. "I've made many unexpected films in recent years; most of my films in the second half of my life have been unexpected."</p>
            <p>At a press conference today, Tsai Ming-liang said that as he gets older, "there isn't much time left to observe this world." He has started to look at the world more, rather than just himself. By going home with Anong, he also saw a new and unfamiliar part of the world. He said he often carries his camera around and films whatever he finds beautiful.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-liang wants films to be "free." He said his films are not about telling stories, and he does not want films to only tell stories. He wants to share a feeling, an image, like looking at art in a museum. "I hope the audience understands that films can be many different things. I also tell the audience from the start that my films are not for entertainment, so they shouldn't go into the wrong cinema."</p>
            <p>Besides showing his films in cinemas, Tsai Ming-liang also works with many art museums. He believes that people's eyes need to be trained. He encourages audience members to go to art museums often to develop their understanding of beauty and to be open to different ways films can be made. "If you see film as a type of art, you will be more willing to accept different ways of showing things." He joked that having him in the film industry is a good thing because "you can see the different possibilities of film."</p>
            <p>After leaving Busan, Tsai Ming-liang will go to the Czech Republic next month to film the 12th part of his "Walker series." He also said that he will film "Walker" in Korea next year. "You will see 'Walker' appear in many different places around the world, and this series is good to watch in cinemas, but you can also see it in art museums," he said.</p>

            <h1>Agricultural Group Visits Ohio to Make Taiwan-US Food Supply Chains Stronger</h1>
            <p>A group from Taiwan that works in agriculture visited Columbus, Ohio, in the United States. They signed agreements with local farming industry groups to buy more farm products. Du Wen-chen, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, said that this shows Taiwan supports Ohio's farmers. It helps to reduce problems from changes in international trade and makes the food supply chain between Taiwan and the U.S. more stable and strong.</p>
            <p>The agricultural group, led by Vice Minister of Agriculture Du Wen-chen, visited Ohio from September 20 to 23. On September 22, representatives from Taiwan's soybean and corn industries signed agreements with related industry groups in Columbus, the state capital. Du Wen-chen, the head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Chicago, Lei Yen-feng, and government officials and leaders from the Ohio state assembly were there.</p>
            <p>Hung Yao-kun, who is the head of the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers Association, and Yang Chieh, a board member of the Taiwan Feed Industry Association, signed agreements. They will buy corn products worth about 2.12 billion US dollars (about 64 billion New Taiwan dollars) and soybean products worth 3.44 to 4.2 billion US dollars from the U.S. over four years.</p>
            <p>Du Wen-chen pointed out that Taiwan and Ohio have been sister states for a long time and have a strong friendship. Their partnership is very close. Ohio farmers work hard and try to grow more crops using natural methods. Also, the state government, the state assembly, and top universities support this partnership.</p>
            <p>Du Wen-chen stressed that signing these agreements not only makes trade connections stronger but also shows Taiwan's support for Ohio farmers. It helps farmers deal with problems caused by changes in international trade. This makes the food supply chain between Taiwan and the U.S. more secure and strong.</p>
            <p>Lei Yen-feng said that this year is the 46th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. He noted that the relationship between Taiwan and the U.S. has grown a lot in many ways. They are strong partners in safety, trade, and shared values. Their relationship helps each other, and their trade connections have become much deeper. In 2024, Taiwan's investment in the U.S. was 40% of its total investment outside Taiwan. From 2021 to 2023, the amount of trade also grew by 50%, creating a strong business system.</p>
            <p>Ohio officials and state assembly leaders welcomed and thanked the agricultural group for their visit. They said that Taiwan is one of Ohio's top five trade partners. They believe this agricultural cooperation between the two sides is very important and will benefit both. State government officials gave thank-you letters from Governor Mike DeWine and Lieutenant Governor Jim Tressel.</p>
            <p>Earlier, the 2025 Republic of China (Taiwan) Agricultural Products Trade Friendly Visit Group went to Washington D.C. Then, they visited Arkansas, Ohio, Indiana, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Florida, and Texas. They talked about buying agricultural products like soybeans, corn, wheat, and beef.</p>
