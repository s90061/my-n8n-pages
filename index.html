            <h1>Trump to Meet Putin in Alaska: Friendly or Tough Attitude Draws Attention</h1>
            <p>When Donald Trump was the US President in 2018, his friendly meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, surprised his allies. This was because Trump did not agree with his own intelligence agencies about Russia's interference in US elections, and he sided with Putin.</p>
            <p>Reuters reports that Trump will fly to Alaska to talk with Putin. However, this time the mood is different. Trump is unhappy that Moscow has been slow to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. He is also angry about Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>
            <p>The world is watching to see which Trump will appear at the summit in Anchorage. Will it be the tougher Trump we see now, or the Trump who tried to please the smart former KGB agent and real estate businessman?</p>
            <p>The answer to this question could have a big impact on European leaders. They are worried that if Russia is allowed to take over parts of Ukraine, Moscow might become even more aggressive towards nearby NATO countries like Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia.</p>
            <p>It is even more important for Ukraine to know which Trump will meet Putin. This is because after three and a half years of war, Ukrainian forces are losing ground.</p>
            <p>Even though Trump has acted tougher towards Putin in recent months, he has tried to calm Putin down more often. In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, Trump did not directly criticize Putin. And Putin, who many US presidents have ignored, praised Trump's efforts to make US-Russia relations better.</p>
            <p>People who study the Kremlin are waiting to see if Trump will again be charmed by Putin and agree with the idea that "Russia has the right to control Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Dan Fried, a former diplomat for many US presidents and now working at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, said, "It is reasonable to worry that Putin might trick Trump into making a bad deal that harms Ukraine."</p>
            <p>However, Fried also said that another result is possible. He said, "It is also reasonable that the US government now understands that Putin is still playing games with them."</p>
            <p>The Trump government has tried to lower expectations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the media on August 12 that this meeting will be a "chance to listen."</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters on August 13 that if the talks in Alaska go well, he might set up a second meeting that includes Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Right now, there are no signs that Russia is ready to give up anything. Ukraine is worried that Trump might make a deal without asking Kyiv's opinion. Zelenskyy said he wants a ceasefire first, followed by security promises.</p>
            <p>This kind of meeting is watched by the whole world. For Trump, making a deal at such a big event is very appealing.</p>
            <p>This year, Trump publicly tried to win the Nobel Peace Prize by calling his diplomatic wins "self-proclaimed." But his strong desire to make a peace deal in Ukraine has made US allies nervous. They worry that the result might make Putin bolder.</p>
            <p>Trump has said that Moscow and Kyiv must exchange land to reach a peace deal. This has recently caused protests from Ukrainian and European leaders.</p>
            <p>Russian forces now control Crimea and large parts of eastern Ukraine, and Ukrainian forces have fully left Russian territory they once held. So, people are asking what exactly Russia and Ukraine can exchange.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump insists that because of his personal friendship with Putin, only he can end this war.</p>
            <p>John Bolton, who was a national security advisor in Trump's last government and now speaks critically of Trump, said he is worried that Putin has "started to work his magic on Trump."</p>
            <p>Bolton said, "Personal connections can help in diplomacy, just like in other areas. But for someone as tough as Putin, decisions are not made by feelings. They are made by cold, hard calculations. Trump has not understood this."</p>
