            <h1>German Winter Olympic Gold Medalist Dies in Pakistan Mountains After Being Hit by Falling Rock</h1>
            <p>Laura Dahlmeier, a 31-year-old German athlete who won gold medals in Winter Olympic biathlon, died today. She was hit by a falling rock on a mountain in Pakistan.</p>
            <p>Her company, which manages her career, shared the sad news today. They said it was very dangerous at the accident site. Because of this, it was 'not possible at all' to rescue her.</p>
            <p>The statement said, 'The efforts to save her failed, and this operation has stopped.'</p>
            <p>The International Biathlon Union also spoke about it. They said, 'Laura's energy and love for life touched many people around the world.'</p>
            <p>'Her important legacy, both in and out of biathlon, will always be remembered. It will continue to inspire many athletes and brave people in the future.'</p>
            <p>Gabriela Soukalova, a Czech athlete who was Dahlmeier's friend and competitor, wrote on social media: 'This is a very big shock. Laura will always be in my heart.'</p>
            <p>Dahlmeier's team put a statement on their official social media page. It said the accident happened around noon on July 28. The place was Laila Peak, which is 5700 meters high, in the Karakoram Mountains.</p>
            <p>Her climbing partner called for help after reaching a safe area.</p>
            <p>A local government official, Areeb Ahmed Mukhtar, told a news agency: 'We knew that a helicopter rescue could not happen.'</p>
            <p>Dahlmeier's team said yesterday that 'she was hit by a falling rock.' No one could get to her because there was a risk of more rocks falling, and the place was very far away.</p>

            <h1>Hourly Pay for Part-time Teachers in Private Schools Must Not Be Lower Than Public Schools from August 1</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education in Taiwan has changed a rule. This rule is about part-time teachers in colleges and universities. From August 1, 2025, private schools must pay their part-time teachers the same or more per hour than public schools. The Ministry of Education will also give money to help schools pay for this change.</p>
            <p>Many private schools have not changed how much they pay their part-time teachers. This is because they have fewer students and less money. Education groups have asked the Ministry of Education many times to change this. So, the Ministry of Education changed the rule. It now clearly states that 'the hourly pay for part-time teachers in private colleges and universities cannot be less than the amount paid in public colleges and universities.' This new rule will start on August 1 this year.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education announced today that it will help private schools with money. This is to make it easier for them to pay the higher hourly rates. For three years, starting from August 2025 until July 2028, the government will pay a bigger part of the extra money needed. It will pay 90% of the difference, instead of the old 50% or 70%.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that after these three years, they will check many things. They will look at how private colleges and universities are doing, their money situation, how good their teaching is, and how many full-time and part-time teachers they have. They will also think about the government's money. Then, they will decide what to do next to help the schools.</p>
