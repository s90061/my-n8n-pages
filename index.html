            <h1>US Vice President Says Russia Made Big Concessions in Peace Talks</h1>
            <p>US Vice President Vance said that Russia has made "big changes" in talks to end the war with Ukraine. Even though it doesn't look like the fighting will end soon, he feels hopeful about the progress.</p>
            <p>This month, former President Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to talk about the Russia-Ukraine war. News reports say that Vance said in a pre-recorded interview that Trump has been doing "very active, very strong diplomatic work" with both Moscow and Kyiv. He is trying to find a way to stop the killing.</p>
            <p>Trump wants the presidents of Ukraine and Russia to talk directly. But both countries blame each other for not wanting to have these talks.</p>
            <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Western countries are trying to "stop" the peace talks. At the same time, Vance spoke more kindly about Russia, which is usually Washington's enemy. He said that Moscow is not tricking Trump.</p>
            <p>Vance told the NBC show "Meet the Press": "I think that for the first time in three and a half years of this conflict, Russia has made important changes for President Trump."</p>
            <p>"They have actually been ready to be flexible on some main demands."</p>
            <p>Vance said that Moscow has given in on some points, "agreeing that Ukraine will have all its land after the war." But he did not clearly say if Ukraine would keep its borders from before Russia attacked.</p>
            <p>He also said that Russia has "agreed that they cannot put a puppet government in Kyiv."</p>
            <p>He added: "Again, have they made all the changes? Of course not. But we are making progress."</p>
            <p>Vance said that Washington will continue to work hard to make sure Ukraine is safe. He also firmly stated that "the President has already said that no American soldiers will be directly in Ukraine."</p>

            <h1>Premier Cho: Working to Lower Tariffs, Agreement to be Reviewed by Congress</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai will give a special report to the Legislative Yuan today about the trade talks between Taiwan and the US. In his written report, he said that Taiwan wants to get better and fair tariff rates. They also want to discuss the "Section 232" tariffs. Taiwan is also working to make sure new tariffs are not added on top of existing ones. If an agreement is made, the full text will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>
            <p>The US has started its fair tariffs, and Taiwan's temporary tariff rate is 20%. Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai will go to the Legislative Yuan to present a special report titled "The Progress, Direction, Principles of Taiwan-US Tariff Talks, and an Assessment of Possible Impacts on Taiwanese Industries." He will also answer questions.</p>
            <p>Regarding how the fair tariff rates are calculated, Premier Cho said in his report that the US announced the calculation methods on April 2nd and July 31st. Both methods add "existing tariffs on products imported to the US" and "fair tariffs." "Existing tariffs on products imported to the US" refers to the most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs that the US applies to all countries. Currently, only the European Union has a different calculation method because it has an agreement with the US.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that based on 2024 statistics, the value of US imports from Taiwan was 112.86 billion US dollars for industrial products and 0.89 billion US dollars for agricultural products. The average existing tariff rate for all Taiwanese products imported to the US is 3.3%.</p>
            <p>About non-tariff issues that the US Annual Trade Barriers Report is concerned about, Premier Cho said that Taiwan follows the rule of protecting people's health. They balance this with scientific proof, international rules, and global trade standards. Also, Taiwan and the US strongly agree on making supply chains stronger, especially concerning illegal shipping. Taiwan and the US are working together to fight against fake country-of-origin labeling. They also talked about improving controls on high-tech exports and making investments safer.</p>
            <p>For buying goods, Premier Cho said that both Taiwan and the US want to buy more agricultural and industrial products from the US, such as soybeans, corn, wheat, oil, and natural gas. This is for food and energy security. For investments, industries in Taiwan and the US have always helped each other. In recent years, investment between Taiwan and the US has grown a lot. Both sides believe that more investment can help them grow together and create the best environment for easy cross-border investments.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho stated that the 20% temporary tariff rate is a result from one stage of the talks. Taiwan and the US have not yet made a final agreement. One reason is that there hasn't been a final meeting yet due to timing. Another reason is that Taiwan is the 6th largest country that causes a trade deficit for the US. In 2024, the trade deficit was 73.92 billion US dollars. 90% of this came from information and communication technology (ICT) industries like semiconductors, ICT products, and electronic parts. This is related to the "Section 232" investigation the US is doing. The US's tariff policies are still being planned. So, Taiwan and the US need more time to talk about issues related to Section 232 and working together on supply chains.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that the goals for future talks are to get more helpful and fair tariffs. They also want to discuss Section 232 at the same time. During the process of reaching a fair tariff agreement, they will also try hard to ensure that new tariffs are not added on top of existing ones.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also said that once an agreement is reached with the US, the government team will immediately explain the full agreement to the Legislative Yuan and the public. The full agreement text will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. They will also present an assessment of the impacts at the same time.</p>
            <p>Regarding the impact assessment, Premier Cho said that on July 31st, the US announced that Taiwan's fair tariffs would be lowered from 32% to 20%. After a think tank studied this, the impact on Taiwan's exports, production value, GDP, and jobs is about 50% less than the estimate from early April. Also, as of August 15th, 73 businesses reported that they were affected by tariffs and had to reduce work hours. This affected 2,388 people. The main industries affected are machinery and equipment manufacturing, metal manufacturing, other transportation vehicles like rail cars, aircraft, electric scooters, and their parts.</p>
            <p>For specific product impacts, Premier Cho said that industrial products include machine tools, hand tools, plumbing hardware, and heavy electrical equipment. Agricultural products include moth orchids, edamame, and mahi-mahi. The Executive Yuan has told all government departments to give necessary help to affected industries by moving resources where they are needed most urgently. To help industries, the Executive Yuan passed a revised draft of the "Special Act for Strengthening Economic, Social, and Livelihood National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations" on August 14th. This has been sent to the Legislative Yuan for review, and they hope the legislators will support it.</p>
