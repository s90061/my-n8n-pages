            <h1>US Tariffs: Mayor Lu Says Over 10% Will Really Hurt Businesses</h1>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen spoke at a meeting today. She said that tariffs (taxes on imported goods), exchange rates (how much one country's money is worth compared to another's), and energy are big problems for Taiwan's economy. She said these must be fixed. She added that if the US puts tariffs on Taiwan that are more than 10%, many businesses will be badly affected.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump recently signed an order to delay these tariffs until August 1st. For big trading partners like Japan and South Korea, the new tariff rate is 25%. The US has not yet said what the tariff rate will be for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The "San San Club" held its July 2025 meeting today. They invited Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to give a speech. Her speech was called "Taichung's Way to Success: Mayor Lu's Ideas for Boosting the Economy."</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that she believes Taiwan's economy is now at a very difficult point. Taiwan does not have many natural resources. It depends on sending goods to other countries to make money and survive. But now, Taiwan faces problems with tariffs, exchange rates, and energy. Because of global competition, many Taiwanese companies earn less than 10% profit. So, if the tariffs from the US are more than 10%, companies will be very badly hurt.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu also pointed out that the problem with the New Taiwan Dollar exchange rate is even worse than tariffs. The New Taiwan Dollar has changed from 32NTD to 29NTD for one US dollar. If both tariffs and the exchange rate go up at the same time, Taiwan's businesses will really be in trouble.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that she thinks the government should try to stop the exchange rate from going up more than 5% because of the current tariff problem. If not, Taiwan's economy will suffer a lot.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu also said that energy is a big problem for Taiwan right now. In the past, Taiwanese businesses did not worry much about energy. But now, it is a big concern for them. She said the current government's energy plans are creating problems. She believes the current government has certain beliefs that cause the energy supply and mix to be very unbalanced.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that a very unbalanced energy mix might mean there is not enough electricity. This would make companies less willing to invest. Also, unstable power supply makes the electricity grid weak. Third, she questioned if the way electricity is made causes harm to society. She noted that Taiwan Power Company now uses a lot of coal to make electricity, even starting up coal units that were supposed to be stopped. This causes big problems for local governments.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu stated that Taiwan and its businesses face many problems today. But tariffs, exchange rates, and energy are the most important ones and must be solved. She said solving problems is not hard, but the attitude of the government is very important. She believes the current government is focusing on politics, not the economy. She said that in their first year, all she heard about was removing people from office, not how to deal with tariffs, exchange rates, or energy problems. She hopes the government will solve problems instead of causing them.</p>

            <h1>Han Kuang Exercise: Avenger Missile System Arrives in New Taipei to Protect Taipei's Skies</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Wu Shu-wei, New Taipei, July 16) Today is the 8th day of the "Han Kuang 41" military exercise. The Army's air defense troops have set up Avenger missile systems, which carry Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, in places like New Taipei Metropolitan Park. This is to protect the skies over the greater Taipei area.</p>
            <p>The "Han Kuang 41" military exercise is 10 days and 9 nights long. Today is the 8th day. According to the Ministry of National Defense, yesterday and today's exercises are about a pretend scenario where the Chinese army has landed in Taiwan. They are trying to set up bases and take over ports and airports. Taiwan's military is working with civilians to practice defending the country over a long period.</p>
            <p>A reporter from the Central News Agency went to New Taipei Metropolitan Park today. They saw one Avenger missile vehicle and one medium tactical truck from the Army's artillery troops. The Avenger missile system is on a Humvee vehicle. Soldiers used camouflage nets to cover the front of the Humvee to change its look. Only the missile tower, two sets of four Stinger anti-aircraft missile launchers, and a .50 caliber machine gun were visible at the back of the vehicle. They were ready to watch the sky. Soldiers also carried T91 rifles and guarded the area around the position.</p>
            <p>Not far from New Taipei Metropolitan Park, in a parking lot by the river, another Avenger missile vehicle, a medium tactical truck, and a control vehicle were set up. The missile tower, launchers, and .50 caliber machine gun of the Avenger system were not covered by camouflage nets and remained ready. However, all other equipment was covered with camouflage nets. This hid their original shapes well, making it hard to see the position from far away.</p>
            <p>The Youth Daily News once reported that the Army's Avenger missile system (AN/TWQ-1 Avenger) uses a Humvee with a missile tower, two missile launchers, and a .50 caliber machine gun. It can work on its own. It also uses a PODARS radar to find targets and send information to a command vehicle. Then, the command vehicle tells the Avenger missile vehicle where the target is so it can attack. The Stinger missile it fires can go as fast as 2.2 times the speed of sound and can hit targets up to 4 kilometers away. It uses a special "passive infrared/ultraviolet" system to find and follow targets automatically.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is one of the few countries that uses four different types of Stinger missiles: twin-launcher, vehicle-mounted Avenger, Apache helicopter-mounted, and man-portable shoulder-fired versions.</p>

            <h1>Men in Alternative Service Help After Typhoon, Minister Liu Says Everyone Worked Together to Fix City</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chiang Yi-ching, Yunlin County, July 16) Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in central and southern Taiwan. Since July 14, the Ministry of Interior has sent young men who just finished police academy training to help. These men are doing basic training for alternative military service. Minister of Interior Liu Shih-fang visited Yunlin today to thank them. She said that the fast recovery after the typhoon happened because the central government, local governments, and people all worked together.</p>
            <p>This morning, Minister Liu, with others like Director Shen Che-fang from the Department of Conscription, Director Chen Chun-hsiung from the Central Division of the National Land Management Agency, and Director Hsiao Te-shu from Yunlin County's Civil Affairs Department, went to Touku Township. They encouraged 25 men in alternative service and gave them drinks.</p>
            <p>Minister Liu said that the Ministry of Interior has been sending young men who just graduated from police academies to central and southern Taiwan since July 14. These men are getting basic training for alternative service. They are helping local areas clean up public spaces after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Minister Liu explained that the typhoon brought strong winds, which blew away or partly destroyed many roofs. So, Premier Cho Jung-tai announced yesterday that they will give more money for "recovery relief" for damaged homes. The amount of money will depend on the size of the house. She asked county and city governments to work with local offices to help people apply for this money.</p>
            <p>Minister Liu also said that the government kept telling people to prepare for the typhoon. This was the first time they sent text messages to people in affected areas, telling them to evacuate quickly. Even though the typhoon caused a lot of damage in central and southern Taiwan, the number of people hurt or killed was very low. This shows that people were ready for the danger.</p>
            <p>Minister Liu mentioned that cities are slowly looking normal again. This is all thanks to the central government, local governments, and people working together. In the future, the Ministry of Interior will make disaster prevention even better.</p>
            <p>Director Hsiao Te-shu said that in the past four days, more than 200 men in alternative service came to Yunlin County. They helped clear public areas in towns like Linnei after the disaster. Now, about 90% of the city looks normal again.</p>
