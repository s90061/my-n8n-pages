            <h1>Scam Groups Pretend to Be Others to Cheat People; NCC Suggests Blocking Calls with Hidden Numbers</h1>
            <p>Recently, some people have received calls with hidden numbers. The person on the phone said they were an official from the National Communications Commission (NCC). They lied and said the person's phone number was used illegally. They used this trick to steal millions of Taiwanese dollars. The NCC explained today that they do not call people directly, and they never use hidden numbers. These calls are scams.</p>
            <p>The National Police Agency's "165 Anti-Fraud Dashboard" recently shared an example. A person received a call with a hidden number. The person on the phone claimed to be an NCC official. They lied and said the person's mobile number was used illegally, and their identity might have been stolen. Then, they connected the person to fake lawyers and police. These fake officials asked for "evidence fees" and "deposit money." This way, they tricked the person into giving them millions of dollars.</p>
            <p>The NCC posted on Facebook that they do not call people directly. If you get a call from someone who says they are from the NCC and their number is hidden, it is a scam call.</p>
            <p>The NCC also reminds everyone to be very careful when they see calls with hidden numbers. If you are not sure, please call the "165 Anti-Fraud Hotline" right away to check.</p>
            <p>The NCC said that recently there are still scam cases where people pretend to be government agencies and use "hidden numbers." To lower the risk of being scammed, the NCC suggests that people set their phones to reject calls with hidden numbers. For landlines, people can ask Chunghwa Telecom for a "call filtering" service. This service will automatically block calls that do not show a number or send them to voicemail.</p>
            <p>If you have an iOS phone, there is a function called "Silence Unknown Callers." This function can automatically silence calls from people not in your contacts or people you haven't talked to before (including calls with hidden numbers). To use it, go to "Settings," tap "Phone," and then turn on "Silence Unknown Callers."</p>
            <p>If you have an Android phone, most models can use the "Block unknown numbers" setting. This will directly stop calls from hidden numbers. To set this up, open the "Phone" app, go to "Settings," find "Blocked numbers," and turn on "Block callers with no number" or "Block unknown numbers."</p>
            <p>The NCC suggests that if elderly people at home do not know how to set this up, their friends and family can help them. Or, they can take their phone to a nearby telecom service center and ask the staff for help.</p>

            <h1>Former Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi Dies at 101; His "Murayama Statement" Apologized for War Aggression 50 Years After the War</h1>
            <p>Former Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi passed away today in a hospital in Oita City. He was 101 years old and died from old age. Fifty years after World War II, Murayama made a speech called the "Murayama Statement." In this statement, he admitted that Japan had ruled and attacked other countries. He said that Japan wanted to look at its history honestly, admit its attacks, truly regret them, and apologize. This was a very important moment in Japan's history.</p>
            <p>Oita TV reported that Murayama was born in Oita City on March 3, 1924. He was the sixth child out of 11 brothers and sisters.</p>
            <p>In June 1994, Murayama became the 81st Prime Minister. This happened when the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the New Party Sakigake formed a combined government. He was the first Prime Minister from Oita Prefecture. In 1995, which was 50 years after World War II ended, he made the "Murayama Statement."</p>
            <p>The "Murayama Statement" was approved by the Cabinet and released on August 15, 1995. Some people agreed with it, and some disagreed. However, later Prime Ministers like Koizumi Junichiro and Abe Shinzo used words from the "Murayama Statement," such as "deep regret," when they made their own statements 60 and 70 years after the war.</p>
            <p>But some people in Japan thought that the "Murayama Statement" unfairly blamed Japan for its past actions. They believed it hurt Japan's good name and national interests.</p>
            <p>When Murayama was interviewed this year, he said, "Admitting past mistakes, showing an apology and a promise for peace will help build trust with other Asian countries. This is also good for Japan's future." He also said he was "very happy to see that later governments continued to follow this statement, and it became the basis for diplomatic relationships with Asian countries."</p>
            <p>Murayama said he would leave his job in January 1996. He was Prime Minister for 561 days. After he left office, he became the first leader of the "Social Democratic Party," which was the new name for the "Socialist Party." In 2000, he stopped running for elections and left politics completely. After that, he lived a calm life at home with his family.</p>
            <p>When he turned 100 in 2024, Murayama said, "I don't really feel like I'm 100 years old. I just live naturally and don't try too hard. I feel very happy to spend each day with my family."</p>
            <p>Murayama lived to be 101 years old. Among all Japanese Prime Ministers, only Higashikuni Naruhiko, who lived to 102, lived longer.</p>

            <h1>Lu Jin-kai Was Found Not Guilty in a Re-trial for a Murder Case 30 Years Ago; The High Prosecutors Office Appeals</h1>
            <p>Lu Jin-kai, a baker, was involved in a murder case of a female university student from National Chung Hsing University in 1993. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Later, Lu Jin-kai asked for a re-trial, and the court agreed. At the end of September this year, the High Court decided he was not guilty. The High Prosecutors Office believes that the original court's decision did not have enough reasons, so they appealed today.</p>
            <p>In 1993, a female student from National Chung Hsing University went to an apartment on the third floor in Zhonghe City (now Zhonghe District, New Taipei City) for an interview arranged by a tutoring center. She then died. Police investigated and believed that Lu Jin-kai, a baker who lived in the apartment, and his friend Chen Hsi-ching, who was staying with him, were very likely involved. In early 1994, both men were caught.</p>
            <p>The police and prosecutors said that Chen Hsi-ching, who had a record of public indecency, was released from prison on December 17, 1993. He then went to stay with Lu Jin-kai, whom he knew from prison. On December 22 of the same month, Chen Hsi-ching pretended to look for a tutor. The tutoring center arranged for the female student to come for an interview. Chen Hsi-ching and Lu Jin-kai worked together to hold down the female student and sexually assaulted her. They also tied her sanitary pants around her neck, which caused her to suffocate and die.</p>
            <p>The first court sentenced Chen Hsi-ching and Lu Jin-kai to death. The Supreme Court sent the case back many times for re-trials. In the sixth re-trial, the Taiwan High Court decided that Lu Jin-kai had tied the sanitary pants around the female student's neck, but it did not kill her. It was Chen Hsi-ching who later tied another knot that caused the student's death. Because of this, Lu Jin-kai was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sexual assault and attempted murder. Chen Hsi-ching was sentenced to death.</p>
            <p>After the sixth re-trial, Lu Jin-kai chose not to appeal, so his sentence was final. Chen Hsi-ching continued to appeal. The Supreme Court sentenced Chen Hsi-ching to death in 2009, and this sentence was final. Lu Jin-kai was released from prison on parole in 2012. He asked for another re-trial, and the Taiwan High Court agreed. The prosecutors appealed against this decision, and the Supreme Court cancelled it and sent it back. In April this year, the High Court again agreed to a re-trial. After looking at the case, on September 25, the court decided that there was not enough proof, and he was found not guilty.</p>
