The Ministry of Education recently updated its list of recognized universities and higher education institutions in mainland China. They removed Jinan University in Guangzhou. This is the first time the list has changed in almost ten years. After this change, there are still 154 universities and 191 colleges on the list.

The Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said earlier this year that schools connected to China's United Front Work Department have special goals and are not just for academics. He said it is important to stop working with them, and the Ministry of Education will not recognize their degrees in the future.

The Ministry of Education officially removed Jinan University in Guangzhou from its list. The Ministry explained that Jinan University in mainland China has been managed by the United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic environment, they removed the university from the list. This is because student learning places should not have specific political goals.

The Ministry also repeated that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, fair, and mutually beneficial. Schools that organize trips for students to China should follow Taiwan's policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of activities, who is organizing them, the travel plans, and any promotional materials. These activities should not have political goals or content. Schools should also avoid accepting one-sided invitations or helping with China's policies and political messages.

The Ministry added that if schools are unsure about the organizers or plans of an activity, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for clarification. They still hope to help young students from both sides learn and understand each other, but students should be aware of risks during exchanges and check the background of the organizers and if there are any political goals.

**Video/First Car Fire on Kinmen Bridge: Camera Shows Car "Suddenly Became a Ball of Fire"**

Today at 2:16 PM, the first car fire happened on Kinmen Bridge. A small car hit the divider and caught fire. It seems a tire burst, making the car slide. The driver, Mr. Lin, and one passenger safely got out. No one was hurt. Police and firefighters quickly arrived to control traffic and put out the fire. The car was completely burned. Police are still checking why it happened.

The Kinmen County Fire Department got a call at 2:10 PM. They were told a car was on fire near the Huhu section of Kinmen Bridge in Jincheng Township. The car was stuck on the divider and burning. The fire department sent four fire trucks and 12 firefighters. Team leader Dong Bi-wen led the rescue.

When rescuers arrived, they saw the car on fire, stuck on the divider. Luckily, the driver and passenger had already gotten out. Firefighters used two hoses to put out the fire quickly and cool the car down to stop it from relighting. The car was totally destroyed, but luckily, no one was hurt.

Police found that Mr. Lin was driving towards Lieyu on Kinmen Bridge. About 1 kilometer in, he heard a tire burst. The car then slid, hit the divider, and caught fire for an unknown reason. Police checked the driver for alcohol, but he had not been drinking. The exact cause is still being investigated.

After the accident, police first allowed one-way traffic on the bridge. Then, they moved the car and environmental protection workers cleaned up oil and debris. The road is now fully open in both directions after cleaning.

The fire department reminds drivers to always check their car and keep a safe distance. If there is a car accident or fire, call 119 right away. Tell them exactly what happened and if anyone is hurt to help them arrive quickly.

The Jincheng Police Station advises that if a tire bursts while driving, do not suddenly brake. Instead, take your foot off the gas to slow down, keep the steering wheel straight, turn on your hazard lights, and pull over to the side of the road. If you can't control the car, you can rub against the guardrail to slow down and avoid flipping over. Also, if your car stops on the side of the road after an accident, follow seven steps: "open, place, leave, call, take pictures, move, wait" to keep people and the car safe. Especially at night or when it's hard to see, place your warning triangle further away to warn other drivers.

**"Too Scared to Cry" â€“ Chinese Spouse Xiao Wei Returns to Guizhou, Says She's Afraid and Got a Threatening Call at Night**

Xiao Wei, a Chinese spouse whose residency permit was taken away, posted a video today. In it, she said she got a threatening call late at night from the police in mainland China. She sadly said, "I'm so scared, I can't even cry."

Xiao Wei's residency permit was canceled because she was seen promoting "unification by force" on TikTok. In April this year, the immigration agency made her leave Taiwan. After Xiao Wei went back to Guizhou, China, she started sharing videos about life in the countryside. But she still speaks her mind. She made a video accusing the "Secretary of Guanzhou Town, Xinchang Village, of not doing his job." She complained that she hadn't received compensation money for land flooded by a reservoir. Unexpectedly, today she said she got a threatening call from the Chinese police late at night. She sadly repeated, "I'm so scared, I can't even cry."

In her video today on TikTok, Xiao Wei said she is very scared now. She said she is a farmer, a common person, and a "three good" citizen who has not broken any laws. She just asked the village committee why they hadn't given her the compensation money. On June 28th, after midnight, she received a warning and threatening call from the Guanzhou police station.

In the video, Xiao Wei said she is a "three good" farmer and cannot handle being scared. She questioned why the police station called to warn her and for what reason. She said, "I'm shaking while filming this video. Is there still justice? Is there still fairness?" She angrily asked the Chinese police, "Is it wrong for me to protect my rights legally? How do you people work and enforce laws at the police station? Is this how you treat farmers? You call to show your power."

Xiao Wei said she is truly very scared and cannot cry. At the end of the video, she strongly asked, "Please, related departments, protect us farmers. The more I think about it, the more scared I get. We farmers have no powerful connections, so we can only use the internet to ask for justice. Please pay attention."
