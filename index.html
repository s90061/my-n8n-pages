            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Sea Warning Issued, Shei-Pa National Park Temporarily Closed</h1>
            <p>Miaoli County, July 18 (CNA) â€” The Shei-Pa National Park Management Office announced today that the Central Weather Administration has issued a sea warning for Tropical Storm Wipha. To keep visitors safe, Shei-Pa National Park is closing temporarily from today. All entry permits that were given out before are now invalid.</p>
            <p>The Shei-Pa Management Office put out a notice saying that because the Central Weather Administration issued a sea warning for Tropical Storm Wipha at 11:30 AM, people are now forbidden to enter the Shei-Pa National Park's Ecological Protection Area and other controlled areas. During this time, all entry permits that were already given out are immediately invalid.</p>
            <p>The Shei-Pa Management Office said that if people want to enter the park later, they will need to apply for new entry permits. The times when different areas will open again will be announced after the typhoon warning is lifted and after park staff check for damage and prepare the environment.</p>
            <p>Also, because the Jiujiu Mountain Cabin, which is managed by the Hsinchu branch of the Ministry of Agriculture's Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency, is in a remote mountain area, it will also stop offering overnight stays. Hikers who had already booked stays will get a full refund.</p>
            <p>The Shei-Pa Management Office reminds everyone to avoid going to the mountains during the typhoon and to go out less if it is not necessary. It is very important to prepare for the typhoon. (Edited by Hsieh Ya-chu) 1140718</p>

            <h1>"Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint": 85% of Scenes Use CG Effects to Make a World That Looks Both Real and Fake</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 18 (CNA) â€” "Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint," a new movie from the team behind "Along with the Gods," recently became number one in pre-sales in South Korea, with 20.6% of tickets sold before release. About 85% of the film's 1,500 shots use computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create a world where it's hard to tell what's real and what's not.</p>
            <p>According to information from the movie company, "Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint" has caused a lot of talk in South Korea even before its release. Its rights for overseas viewing have also been sold to 113 countries and regions. However, only Taiwan and South Korea are showing the movie at the same time. When the movie was shown as a test in South Korea, the original author, Sing N Song, told the director, "I really love it!"</p>
            <p>To make the scenes from the original story come to life, "Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint" has 1,500 shots in total. More than 1,300 of these shots use CGI, meaning over 85% of the shots had to be newly created. The special effects team said that to make sure the real and fake worlds look balanced, they paid close attention to details for everything from monsters and weapons to train cars.</p>
            <p>For example, in the main settings of the movie, like the train car and platform, art director Lee Mok-won purposely designed shelves that could turn 90 degrees in the scene where the train car flips over. He also thought about the train's size and how it should look and feel. This was to make the train going off the tracks and crashing look more real. For the subway platforms, to show that each station is different, they changed the colors to create a different feeling.</p>
            <p>"Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint" will be shown in all of Taiwan on July 23. (Edited by Kuan Chung-wei) 1140718</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Influencer Yaner Says Malaysian Police Extorted and Harassed Her; Representative Office Asks for an Investigation</h1>
            <p>Singapore, July 18 (CNA) â€” Taiwanese internet celebrity Yaner recently said that when she was traveling in Malaysia, police stopped her and said they would "fine her 10,000 Malaysian ringgit or put handcuffs on her." They even asked her to "go to a bar for a drink" to let her go. The Malaysian representative office told CNA that they received a request for help from Yaner on July 16. They quickly checked on her and made sure she was safe. They have now officially sent a letter to the Malaysian police, strongly asking them to start an investigation right away.</p>
            <p>This event has caused a lot of discussion on social media and has been reported by Malaysian media. The police have started an investigation and will take action against the officers involved.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese internet celebrity Yaner recently posted on her Instagram page that when she was traveling in Malaysia, police stopped her on the street. While she was looking for her passport, she accidentally touched the video recording button on her phone. A police officer then yelled at her, "Why are you secretly filming?" He told her to get out of the car, took her phone, and threatened her, saying, "You will be fined 10,000 Malaysian ringgit, or I will put handcuffs on you and take you to the police station for a night."</p>
            <p>She said that at that time, the police officer told her to change her phone's language to English. He even looked through her travel photos and opened her banking app to check her account, asking, "How much Malaysian ringgit can you exchange?" Besides this, the officer also asked her to "give me 1,000 Malaysian ringgit, and after work, come to a bar with me, and I'll let you go." This made her feel unsafe.</p>
            <p>She said that when you are traveling, being calm and aware is more important than anything. Since the police officer already knew where she was staying, she immediately booked another hotel. But the officer kept sending messages trying to reach her. She then blocked his account.</p>
            <p>This incident has caused a lot of discussion on social media. Malaysian media, like the Malay Mail and China Press, reported that the police have confirmed the identity of the "corrupt police officer" involved and will take further action. They are also trying to find out how many officers were involved in setting up the roadblock at the time of the incident.</p>
            <p>Lai Chun-quan, an assistant to Malaysian Member of Parliament Lim Lip Eng, said in the report that he has gone to the police headquarters to help understand the case and has provided related evidence. The report said that after checking the accusations, the police confirmed that this was not done by fake police officers. "The Police Integrity and Standards Department (JIPS) has started an investigation into this case, and the identity of the officer involved has now been confirmed."</p>
            <p>Many Malaysian internet users left comments below Yaner's post, saying things like, "We support you, hope this case will be fully investigated," "Police should take their accountability," and "Hope the Malaysian government will take this matter more seriously." Yaner also replied to some of the comments.</p>
            <p>The Representative Office in Malaysia told CNA that they received a request for help from Yaner on July 16. They immediately showed concern and support and confirmed that Yaner was safe. They then officially sent a letter to the Malaysian police, strongly asking them to start an investigation right away.</p>
            <p>The case is now being investigated. The representative office will continue to work with the Malaysian side to find out more about the case and make sure people's rights are protected. They remind people traveling to Malaysia to contact the Representative Office in Malaysia quickly if they face any emergency. (Edited by Chen Cheng-kung) 1140718</p>
