Many people in the United States are changing how they spend money in their daily lives. Even though inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, has slowed down, prices for many everyday goods and services are still high. This means that families are feeling pressure on their budgets.

Because of the high costs, a recent report shows that many Americans are cutting back on non-essential spending. For example, they are eating out less often, buying fewer new clothes, and spending less on entertainment like movies or concerts. Some are even using their savings or credit cards to cover basic needs like food and bills. This change in spending habits shows that while the economy is improving in some ways, managing daily expenses remains a challenge for many households.

**Work: AI Changes How People Work**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming a common part of the workplace, and both companies and their employees need to learn to trust it. As AI tools become more advanced, they are helping with many tasks, from analyzing large amounts of data to making decisions. For AI to be successfully used, people need to understand how it works and what its limits are.

Building trust in AI means that employees and managers must learn to use these new tools effectively and safely. This involves training workers on how to interact with AI, understanding its strengths, and knowing when human judgment is still necessary. Experts say that developing a good relationship with AI is crucial for future job success, as AI is changing many job roles and requiring new skills from workers.

**Travel: Cities Limit Tourists to Protect Local Life**

Many popular cities around the world are facing a problem called "overtourism." This happens when too many visitors come to a place, causing difficulties for local residents, damaging the environment, and putting stress on the city's services. To protect their unique culture and daily life, some famous destinations are now taking steps to control the number of tourists.

Cities like Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Venice in Italy, and Kyoto in Japan have started introducing new rules and fees. For example, some cities are increasing tourist taxes, limiting the number of short-term rental properties, or even creating zones where large tour groups cannot enter. The goal of these measures is to find a balance, allowing people to enjoy these beautiful places while also preserving them for the people who live there.
