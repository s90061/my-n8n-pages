            <h1>Maanshan Nuclear Plant Drill Focuses on Fuel Pool Water and Backup Power</h1>
            <p>The 31st nuclear safety drill at Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant started today. The first day's drill was held inside the plant. It pretended that a nuclear accident happened where the fuel pool was damaged by natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Taipower explained that after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, they made better plans for refilling the fuel pool and improved their backup power systems.</p>
            <p>Taipower's yearly emergency drill began today. It practiced for a difficult nuclear accident caused by an earthquake and a tsunami, which also damaged the plant's used fuel pool. The drill included getting staff ready and practicing emergency steps. The first day of the drill was held inside the plant.</p>
            <p>Taipower explained that the drill focused on starting backup power, quickly adding water to the used fuel pool, putting out fires, clearing roads with special machines, and helping people who were hurt by radiation. They also thought about situations from the Noto Peninsula earthquake in Japan to make their response plans and preparations stronger. Today's drill imagined a large earthquake where both units lost outside power, and Unit 2 at Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant had a leak, causing the water level in the pool to go down continuously.</p>
            <p>Taipower staff explained at the site that after both units at Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant stopped working, all used nuclear fuel is kept in the used fuel pool. The two units at Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant can store 2160 fuel rods. Right now, each unit has about 1900 fuel rods. They are kept in water to stay cool and to stop radiation from the nuclear fuel. So, the safety of the used fuel pool is very important.</p>
            <p>Taipower staff said that the original system for adding water had two sources: the storage tank for changing fuel water and the unit that stores condensed water. Water was sent into the pool through pipes. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, Taipower improved its plan for adding water. New water sources include tanks for fire water, raw water pools, and options to use fresh water from Longluan Lake or seawater from near Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant.</p>
            <p>For electricity, 12 mobile diesel generators that use 480 volts have been bought. These can power the existing pumps that move water. There are also mobile diesel pumps and special pumps on fire trucks to provide different ways to power the water refilling. The mobile diesel generators are kept in different places, in two warehouses that are 24 and 26 meters above sea level, to keep them safe from tsunamis.</p>
            <p>The nuclear safety drill will happen outside the plant tomorrow. It will go to places like Daguan Community, Hengchun Elementary School, Manzhou Elementary School, Fangliao High School, and Fangliao Hospital. The drills will include helping people who cannot move easily to leave, closing tourist places and asking visitors to go, sending different supplies to areas that are cut off, and providing medical help for radiation injuries.</p>
            <p>Taipower also mentioned that they asked smart people and experts to judge the drill. After the drill, they will give ideas for Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant to get better. This is to make sure that if a nuclear accident happens, the plant can quickly get ready and handle the emergency well, protecting the nuclear power plant and the health of people nearby.</p>

            <h1>Air Force Says Rumors of First F-16V Delivery on Double Ten Day Are Not True</h1>
            <p>The Air Force is buying 66 F-16V (block70) fighter planes from the United States. There were rumors that the first two planes would arrive in Taiwan around the Double Ten National Day. The Air Force said today that these reports are just guesses and are not true. They will keep meeting with the US and checking the production line themselves to get ready for the planes to come back later.</p>
            <p>The Air Force spent 110 billion New Taiwan Dollars on a project called "Phoenix Project." This project upgraded 141 of their old F-16A/B jets to F-16V (block20) jets. This upgrade is now finished. The Air Force also has another project, called "Phoenix Rising Project," to buy 66 brand new F-16V (block70) jets from the US. These new planes will be stationed at Taitung Chihhang Air Force Base in the future.</p>
            <p>News outlets reported today that the first two F-16V (block70) jets are planned to arrive in Taiwan and be given to the Air Force around the Double Ten National Day.</p>
            <p>The Air Force told the Central News Agency tonight that they regularly meet with the US project office to stay updated on how production is going and any risks with putting systems together. Also, staff working at the factory personally check the production line. This helps them plan pilot training and get ready for the planes to return on time.</p>
            <p>The Air Force strongly stated that the news reports about the planes returning are only guesses and are not true.</p>
            <p>For how the planes will be delivered in the future, the Air Force will use the same method as when the F-16A/B jets were delivered in 1997. Single-seat planes will be flown by US pilots, and two-seat planes will have a US pilot and an Air Force pilot together.</p>
            <p>Military sources said earlier that when F-16A/B jets flew back to Taiwan from the US in 1997, they refueled in the air 19 times. This was about once every hour, and they had to keep a safe amount of fuel. The journey had three parts: "Fort Worth, Texas to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii," which was 3784 miles, took 8 hours and 50 minutes, and needed 9 air refuelings; "Hawaii to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam," which was 3790 miles, took 8 hours and 20 minutes, and needed 6 air refuelings; and "Guam to Chiayi Air Force Base," which was 1744 miles, took 4 hours and 40 minutes, and needed 4 air refuelings.</p>
