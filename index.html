            <h1>Sri Lanka's New Government Fights Corruption; Former President Wickremesinghe Arrested</h1>
            <p>Police in Sri Lanka, a country in South Asia, arrested former President Wickremesinghe today. They accuse him of corruption. This makes him the most important opposition figure arrested since the new left-wing government of President Dissanayake started its fight against corruption.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Dissanayake became president last September. He promised to stop corruption and won against Wickremesinghe. Since then, the country's anti-corruption agency has been leading the effort to stop corruption.</p>
            <p>A Sri Lankan police detective told AFP that Wickremesinghe, who is 76 years old, was questioned and then held by police. This was about a trip he took to London, UK, in September 2023. He went there for a ceremony at a British university for his wife.</p>
            <p>The police officer also said that they are charging Wickremesinghe with using government money for personal reasons. "We will hand him over to the district judge in Colombo Fort," the officer added.</p>
            <p>At that time, Wickremesinghe first went to Havana, the capital of Cuba, for the G77 summit. On his way back, he stopped in London. He went with his wife, Maithree, to the University of Wolverhampton, where she received an honorary professor title.</p>
            <p>The Sri Lankan Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) says that Wickremesinghe used public funds to pay for this private trip. They also claim that the government paid for his security staff.</p>
            <p>Wickremesinghe's office had previously said that he did not use his presidential power incorrectly during his visit to London. He also strongly stated that his wife paid for her trip to the UK herself, and no public money was used.</p>
            <p>Since Dissanayake became president, several important opposition politicians in Sri Lanka have been put in jail for corruption. Some have been sentenced to up to 25 years. These people include two former high-ranking ministers.</p>

            <h1>Shing Mark Company Fails to Pay NT$87.29 Million: Highest Amount This Year, Second Time for a Listed Company</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market has been changing a lot after reaching new high points this week. Today, there is news of another big failure to pay for stock trades. The Taiwan Stock Exchange announced tonight that Yuanta Securities and Hua Nan Securities reported that Shing Mark, a PCB company, had a large trading default. The amount is NT$87.2956 million. This is the biggest amount this year.</p>
            <p>This is the second time this year that a listed company has failed to pay such a large amount. Before this, on August 4th, brokers also reported that Thunder Tiger had a large trading default of NT$58.7657 million. Including both listed and OTC (over-the-counter) companies, this is the ninth large trading default in the market this year.</p>
            <p>Based on Taiwan's "T+2" payment system, the Taiwan Stock Exchange announced the trading default today. This default happened from stock trades on Wednesday (August 20th) of this week. On that day, Shing Mark's stock price dropped by NT$10.6, ending at its lowest price of NT$95.9.</p>
            <p>Recently, there has been a shortage of materials for making PCBs, which are circuit boards. This has caused big changes in the stock prices of related companies. On August 19th, the GreTai Securities Market also announced that First Securities reported that the copper foil company, Chin-Chiu, had a large trading default of NT$10.93 million.</p>

            <h1>76-Year-Old Man in Tucheng, New Taipei, Accused of Killing Mother; New Taipei District Court Orders Detention</h1>
            <p>A 76-year-old man named Kuo from Tucheng District, New Taipei City, is accused of using a knife to kill his 93-year-old mother. The woman was taken to the hospital but died from her serious injuries. After questioning, the New Taipei Prosecutors' Office believed that Mr. Kuo was involved in killing a direct family member (his mother). They asked the court to hold him. The New Taipei District Court decided tonight to detain him, but without restricting his communication.</p>
            <p>On August 16th, the New Taipei City Fire Department received a report about a medical emergency at a home on Yanji Street in Tucheng. When they arrived, they found the woman with many knife wounds and no heartbeat or breathing before reaching the hospital (OHCA). She died after medical treatment. Another man at the scene also had knife wounds, but he was awake and was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
            <p>According to the Tucheng Police Precinct of the New Taipei City Police Department, Mr. Kuo and his mother had not gotten along well for a long time. On that day, they had an argument. Mr. Kuo is accused of killing his mother with a knife and then harming himself. The police will further investigate the reason after Mr. Kuo recovers from his injuries and can be questioned. He will be charged with killing a direct family member.</p>
            <p>Police said that Mr. Kuo was sent to the Taiwan New Taipei District Prosecutors' Office this afternoon for more questioning. Prosecutors believe Mr. Kuo committed the crime of killing a direct family member, which is a serious offense. They asked the Taiwan New Taipei District Court to detain him.</p>
            <p>After questioning, the judge decided that Mr. Kuo is highly suspected of breaking the law about killing a direct family member, according to the Criminal Code of the Republic of China. The judge found strong reasons to believe he might run away or destroy evidence. Therefore, the judge ordered his detention, and he is allowed to meet and communicate with others.</p>
