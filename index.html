            <h1>Vice President Talks About Taiwan's Shield: A Smart Defense System</h1>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim recently talked to a Canadian TV channel (CBC). She said that President Lai Ching-te's idea of a "Taiwan Shield" is a defense system with many parts. It includes air defense for all of Taiwan and a more advanced system that combines finding targets and attacking them. This system will bring together different technologies and use new software to create a strong defense.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao was asked by Chris Brown from CBC in London about how the "Taiwan Shield" missile defense system would work and how it would be paid for. This system was announced by the President during his National Day speech.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that Taiwan has been steadily spending more money on defense for the past few years. If the next year's defense budget is approved by the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's defense spending will reach 3.32% of its GDP next year, which is similar to NATO standards. It might even reach 5% of GDP by 2030. So, Taiwan will keep increasing its defense budget, but this money will be used carefully and for specific needs.</p>
            <p>She also mentioned that for many years, Taiwan and its main security partner, the United States, have been discussing "asymmetric warfare systems." They have agreed to keep focusing on these areas. Now, the President has introduced the "Taiwan Shield" idea. It is a multi-layered defense network that covers Taiwan's air defense. It also includes a more advanced "sensor-to-shooter" system. This system will combine different technologies and use new software to create a strong defense.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that China is also spending a lot of money on new military technology. This is a big challenge, but Taiwan will strongly protect itself. This important investment will make Taiwanese people feel safe and will also show the world that keeping peace in the Taiwan Strait is very important.</p>
            <p>When asked about China's frequent military movements near Taiwan, the Vice President explained Taiwan's latest assessment of China's military threat and possible timelines. She said that everything Taiwan does in security is to stop conflicts from happening. The goal is to prevent attacks. Conflicts around the world remind us that we cannot take peace for granted; we must make our defense stronger. Therefore, "timelines and discussions depend on our own preparation and strength."</p>
            <p>She stated that China is investing a lot in its military and doing more aggressive military drills near the Taiwan Strait. This affects not only Taiwan but also nearby countries and the South China Sea. So, Taiwan must take many actions. First, Taiwan needs to spend more on defense to keep peace through strength. Second, Taiwan needs to work with international partners to use a combined strategy to prevent attacks. This will remind China's leaders and military that war is not an option and no one wins in a conflict.</p>
            <p>The Vice President thanked partners around the world for working with Taiwan to deal with "grey zone threats." These threats are actions that are not full war or conflict but are still dangerous and cause problems. These actions include China's intrusions into Taiwan's waters, airspace, and air defense identification zone. They also include cyberattacks, political interference, and spreading false information. Other threats are isolating Taiwan diplomatically, legal warfare, political warfare, and different types of mental warfare.</p>
            <p>She explained that China uses these methods not only against Taiwan but also against other democratic countries and regions. She believes that democratic countries can do more to strengthen their systems and help each other deal with these grey zone threats. The complex and detailed nature of these mixed grey zone threats is why peaceful and free societies worldwide should work together more closely.</p>
            <p>Regarding young people being affected by Chinese digital platforms like TikTok, she said this is a challenge for Taiwan, Canada, and other democracies. This challenge involves the influence of social media. However, it's not just the influence of social media itself, but also how authoritarian governments use these platforms to cause division within societies and make people lose trust in democratic systems.</p>
            <p>She added that these methods are often seen in China's "cognitive warfare," which is very worrying. Because of this, Taiwan is working with other democratic countries to find the best ways to fight against the influence of authoritarian countries. This includes teaching people how to understand media, making the public aware of how certain plans or platforms work, and fighting against false information.</p>
