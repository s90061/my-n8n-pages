            <h1>Eswatini has received 10 citizens sent back from the United States.</h1>
            <p>Today, the government of Eswatini announced that it has taken in 10 citizens from other countries who were sent back by the United States. This is the second time Eswatini has accepted people sent back by the US, after the first group of five arrived in July.</p>
            <p>Eswatini's Correctional Service shared a statement saying they have confirmed receiving 10 citizens from other countries from the United States.</p>
            <p>According to the Correctional Service's statement, these people will stay in correctional facilities until they can be sent back to their home countries. The statement also said that they are currently in good health and are going through the process of being settled.</p>
            <p>The US government has not yet made a statement about this.</p>
            <p>US President Trump is working to send back millions of immigrants who are living in the country without permission. His government is also trying to make this process stronger by sending some immigrants to other countries.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening, Eswatini announced that it will accept 11 people from the US in October, following an agreement made with the US Trump administration. However, it did not say which countries these people are from.</p>
            <p>Eswatini has not made the details of its agreement with the Trump administration public. The Eswatini government is facing legal challenges from local activists who say the agreement is against the law.</p>
            <p>The first five immigrants sent to Eswatini this year were from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, and Yemen. One man from Jamaica has already been sent back to his country with the help of the Jamaican government. Two more are expected to be sent back soon.</p>

            <h1>The Lions will play in the playoff challenge. Chen Chieh-hsien says it's a small detour, but the goal is still the championship.</h1>
            <p>Today, the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions baseball team lost to the Rakuten Monkeys in an extra inning game. Chen Chieh-hsien, the captain of the Lions, said it's like everyone is in the same car and they have to take a short detour. But, he added, they will all work hard together for the playoff challenge, the Taiwan Series, and their goal of winning the championship.</p>
            <p>In the final regular season game of this year's Chinese Professional Baseball League, the Lions played against the Monkeys at Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium. 7,051 fans came to watch. The two teams played until the 10th extra inning, and the Lions lost 4 to 5.</p>
            <p>After the game, the Lions players and coaches went to thank the fans. Chen Chieh-hsien told the fans that he was very thankful for their support from the first game to the 120th game this season, and for the hard work of the coaching staff and all the players.</p>
            <p>He said that this season, they had a chance to go straight to the championship series (Taiwan Series), but it's like "Google Maps got a bit lost." Even though they have to take a detour, everyone is in the same car. They will continue to work hard in the playoffs, get into the Taiwan Series from the playoff challenge, and aim for the championship.</p>
            <p>The best-of-four playoff challenge will start on October 10th. The Lions, who won the first half of the season, already have one win and will host the first, third, and fourth games at Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium. Their opponents, the Monkeys, will host the second game on October 11th at Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium.</p>
