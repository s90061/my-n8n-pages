            <h1>US Military to Create New Task Force for Anti-Drug Operations in Latin America</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Pentagon announced today that it will start a new joint task force to fight drugs. This team will watch over operations in Latin America. It aims to make military actions against drugs stronger, but legal experts are questioning if it is lawful.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the task force's goal is to "destroy drug groups, stop drugs from causing harm, and keep America safe."</p>
            <p>He wrote on X (a social media platform): "The message is very clear: if you smuggle drugs to our shores, we will stop you completely."</p>
            <p>Until now, the U.S. military has mostly focused on stopping suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea. The U.S. military has already destroyed at least four such boats, and 21 people have died.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Southern Command stated that the new task force will be led by the II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF). The II Marine Expeditionary Force is based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and is known for its ability to quickly operate overseas.</p>
            <p>These attacks have worried some members of Congress from the Democratic Party. Also, some legal experts are asking questions. They believe the Trump administration is testing legal limits and making the President's power too broad.</p>
            <p>At the same time, legal experts are asking why the U.S. military is doing these operations instead of the U.S. Coast Guard, which is the main agency for law enforcement at sea.</p>

            <h1>Song Chia-hsiang Hit a Game-Tying Home Run and a Walk-Off Hit: "I Wanted to End the Game Right Away"</h1>
            <p>In the second game of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) postseason challenge series, the Rakuten Monkeys faced a tough situation. Song Chia-hsiang hit a home run to tie the game and then a walk-off hit to win one game. He said, "At that moment, I just wanted to end the game right away." He also became the youngest player to hit a home run in the history of the postseason challenge series.</p>
            <p>The Uni-President Lions, who won the first half of the season, already had a one-game lead. Yesterday, they beat the Rakuten Monkeys, making their record 2-0 and putting them one win away from moving on. Today, the second game of the postseason challenge series was held at Taoyuan Baseball Stadium. The Monkeys were behind 2-6 at one point. However, they scored 3 runs in the bottom of the 6th inning. In the bottom of the 8th, Song Chia-hsiang hit a solo home run to tie the game. In the bottom of the 9th, with bases loaded, he hit a walk-off single. Finally, they won the game 7-6.</p>
            <p>In this game, Song Chia-hsiang had 4 hits in 5 tries and got 3 RBIs (runs batted in). At 21 years and 81 days old, he became the youngest player to hit a home run in the history of the postseason challenge series. Talking about the game-tying home run in the 8th inning, he said that he just wanted to hit the ball during that turn at bat. He didn't know the ball would fly so far. "When it flew out, I was very excited. I was happy to help the team tie the game."</p>
            <p>As for the final walk-off hit, Song Chia-hsiang said directly that he didn't want the game to continue at that time. He wanted to end the game right away. "It was my turn to bat last, and I wanted to get the win."</p>
            <p>Song Chia-hsiang was a hero in a must-win game for his team. He said, "I think this helps me a lot. I want to use this experience to let many young players know that they can do it. They don't have to wait until they are 25 or 30 years old to do it. Both young and old players can achieve anything. Your own thoughts are very important."</p>
            <p>Besides catcher Song Chia-hsiang, Lin Hung-yu, who was the designated hitter, also had a great game with 3 hits, including one home run.</p>

            <h1>Lin Yueh-ping Explains Bullpen Choices in Challenge Series: Not Holding the Lead Can Change Everything</h1>
            <p>In the second game of the CPBL postseason challenge series, the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions played well offensively but lost to the Rakuten Monkeys. Lions manager Lin Yueh-ping, also known as "Cookie," explained his decisions for the bullpen pitchers. He said that games can change quickly, and if a team doesn't keep its lead, things can go wrong.</p>
            <p>The Lions were the champions of the first half of the year. In the postseason challenge series, which is best of four, they had a one-game lead. Yesterday, they won the first game, making their record 2-0 and putting them close to winning the series. Today, they played the Monkeys at Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium. They were ahead by 4 runs at one point, but they couldn't keep their lead. In the end, they lost the game 6-7.</p>
            <p>Lions manager Lin Yueh-ping said that his team's hitting was very good today. They faced Pedro Fernandez, who was the league leader in wins and strikeouts this year for the Monkeys. Lin said there weren't many changes to their plan. He told the players not to swing at bad pitches and to swing hard at good ones.</p>
            <p>Lin An-ko from the Lions hit two home runs today. Lin Yueh-ping praised him, saying that Lin An-ko is a key player for the Lions' offense and can hit for power. "Today, our offense was exciting, but the opponent's connected hits were even more exciting," he added.</p>
            <p>Regarding his pitching choices, he let Hsin Chun-sheng pitch for more than one inning. In the 9th inning, when the score was tied, he used two young pitchers, Chung Yun-hua and Li Chun, who were both playing in their first postseason challenge series games. Li Chun, at 19 years and 197 days old, became the youngest pitcher in the team's history to play in a postseason challenge series game.</p>
            <p>Lin Yueh-ping explained that he expects his pitchers to get outs. He doesn't often make specific pitching changes. For the 9th-inning pitchers, he thought about putting in the closer right away if the game was tied, but then they would need to protect the lead for another inning. Chung Yun-hua is a reliable pitcher in the bullpen during the regular season, and Lin hoped Chung Yun-hua could hold the lead. However, Chung Yun-hua gave up a walk. "Many of the runs we gave up today started with a walk," Lin said.</p>
            <p>Lin Yueh-ping also mentioned that even though they were leading by 4 runs at one point, games can change very quickly. The team that bats first needs to score many runs. If they don't hold their lead and get the necessary outs, the other team can tie the game or even take the lead with one hit.</p>
