            <h1>Donald Trump's Second Round of Taxes Starts: India, Brazil, and Switzerland Face Very High Rates</h1>
            <p>The second wave of new taxes from the Trump government began at 12:00 AM on August 7th, US Eastern time. Many countries, including Taiwan, will now pay new taxes from 10% to 41%. By the end of this month, India will have to pay a very high tax of 50% because it keeps buying oil from Russia. Brazil also faces a 50% tax on some goods sent to the US due to political reasons. Even after talks in Washington, Switzerland's tax rate of 39% did not change.</p>
            <p>On July 31st, the White House announced a new rule. This rule means that starting August 7th, US Eastern time, products sent to the US from 69 countries and areas will have new taxes. These taxes will be from 10% to 41%. For example, Indonesia and Thailand will pay 19%, South Africa 30%, and Taiwan 20%.</p>
            <p>India continues to buy oil from Russia to meet its people's needs. Because of this, President Donald Trump signed a rule to add another 25% tax. This will increase the total tax from 25% to 50%, and it will start at the end of the month.</p>
            <p>The United States is the biggest country India sells its products to. A 25% tax on products sent to the US already means that companies that use many workers make almost no profit. If India cannot reach an agreement before the new tax starts, it will badly hurt India's growing economy.</p>
            <p>Trump has put a 50% tax on some products from Brazil. This is because of legal issues involving Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's former president and Trump's political ally. The current Brazilian President, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, believes there is no longer any chance for talks between the two countries.</p>
            <p>The President of Switzerland, Karin Keller-Sutter, and other government officials visited Washington. For now, they could not change the high tax rate of 39%. Companies in Switzerland that make expensive products and medicines are already feeling much higher costs.</p>
            <p>This week, Trump's money officials said they will continue to put the current taxes into action. They are still willing to talk if countries have new ideas. However, they will not discuss the tax rates in the near future.</p>
            <p>The "Wall Street Journal" said that Trump thinks these taxes are a very big change for the world's economy. But so far, the effects are only like small tremors, not a huge earthquake.</p>
            <p>Trump has been president for more than six months. The "equal taxes" have been in place for four months. Supermarkets and food stores in the US are not empty. Also, fewer people are losing jobs, and prices are not rising much. The government has collected hundreds of billions of dollars more in taxes. In June, the trade difference (when a country buys more than it sells) was 16% less than in May.</p>
            <p>Some experts who study the economy believe that over time, businesses will see that it is still cheaper to make goods in other countries, even with high taxes. So, they think that manufacturing might not move back to the United States as much as people expect.</p>
            <p>Trump once suggested using taxes on imported goods instead of income tax for people. But the US earns over 2 trillion dollars each year from income and business taxes. The money from taxes on imported goods is much less than the money from these main taxes. However, some politicians from the Republican party have suggested a law to give people back 600 dollars in tax money.</p>

            <h1>US Puts 50% Tax on Coffee, So Brazil Looks to China for Sales</h1>
            <p>The United States has put a 50% tax on coffee from Brazil. This has made it harder for Brazil to sell its coffee. China has started drinking a lot more coffee recently, but it still doesn't buy as much coffee as the US. However, China can be another option for Brazil to sell its coffee.</p>
            <p>Today, a new rule from the Trump government started. It puts a 50% tax on some products that Brazil sends to the US. This new tax only affects about 36% of all goods Brazil sells to the US. But it has a big effect on coffee, which is a very important product for Brazil.</p>
            <p>A news website in Brazil called g1 reported that people in China are drinking much more coffee now. In 2009, they drank 300,000 bags of coffee. Now, they drink 5.8 million bags. This makes China the 6th biggest coffee consumer in the world. Only the European Union, the US, Brazil, the Philippines, and Japan drink more. This shows that coffee is quickly becoming popular in China, a country famous for tea. Even though China has a lot of potential, it is still far from buying the most coffee from Brazil.</p>
            <p>Information from the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Council (CecafÃ©) shows that Brazil sent three times more coffee to China between 2022 and 2023. They sent 1.5 million bags. But in 2024, this number went down to 988,000 bags. This shows that the Chinese market is not yet steady, and the amount they buy can change.</p>
            <p>However, more and more young people in China are becoming interested in coffee. In big cities in China, coffee is becoming a popular and fashionable drink. This gives coffee brands from Brazil a chance to become well-known and succeed quickly, especially for very good quality coffee.</p>
            <p>Because of the problems with the US taxes, companies in Brazil are now looking for new places to sell their products, like China. But they still want to talk with the United States first to try and make the taxes lower. The US is still the biggest buyer of Brazilian coffee. In 2024, Brazil sold 8 million bags of coffee to the US, which was one-third of all the coffee the US bought.</p>
            <p>From July 30th, China allowed 183 Brazilian companies to sell coffee to China for the next five years. Experts say that since the US taxes have started, China allowing more Brazilian companies to sell coffee helps these companies. It stops them from having too much coffee and helps prevent prices from falling.</p>

            <h1>White House Official: New Taxes Are a Big Moment for World Business</h1>
            <p>Today, the United States started putting new taxes on products from many countries. Kevin Hassett, who leads the White House National Economic Council, said this is a very important time in the history of world business and trade. He also said that President Trump knows "the art of the deal," meaning he is good at making agreements.</p>
            <p>Kevin Hassett, the head of the White House National Economic Council, said on Fox Business News that this is the most important time in the history of world business and trade. He said that many countries want to open their markets to the US. This means American farmers and small businesses can sell their products to other countries.</p>
            <p>He explained that countries are agreeing to the US putting taxes of 10%, 15%, or even more on their products. He believes that over the next 10 years, this will bring trillions of dollars in tax money. This money will come from foreign countries and foreign companies, not from taxes on people or businesses inside the US.</p>
            <p>Hassett strongly said that Donald Trump has had a great success with these new taxes. He said that all these agreements were made with both countries agreeing. Countries will open their markets. People thought this could not happen, but it was achieved without a trade war or big fights. He repeated that Trump knows "the art of the deal."</p>
            <p>Fox Business News reported that the US has not yet made agreements with some key trading partners like India, Canada, and Brazil. The tax rates for these countries are 50%, 35%, and 50% respectively. For China and Mexico, the high taxes are paused while discussions continue.</p>
