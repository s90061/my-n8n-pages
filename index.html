Google recently showed new ways its Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help people in their everyday lives. The company is adding more AI features to its Pixel phones and other services, making technology more useful.

One key update allows AI to summarise long emails or meetings. If you miss a work meeting, the AI can quickly give you the main points, saving you time. This means you can catch up on important information without reading everything.

Another feature helps you understand what's happening on your phone screen. You can simply circle an image or text, and the AI will search for information about it. For example, if you see an interesting landmark in a photo, you can circle it to learn more. These changes are designed to make finding information and managing your daily tasks much simpler.

**Companies Ask Workers Back to Office, Sparking Debate**

Many companies are now asking their employees to return to the office after a period of remote work. This change is causing a lot of discussion among workers and businesses. Companies often say that working together in person helps teams collaborate better, builds a stronger company culture, and improves communication.

However, many employees prefer working from home or a mix of home and office (called hybrid work). They enjoy the flexibility, less travel time, and a better balance between work and personal life. For some, returning to the office full-time means giving up these benefits, which can be difficult.

This situation has led to different results. Some companies report improved teamwork, while others face employees leaving their jobs because they want to keep working remotely. The debate about the best way to work continues as companies try to find a balance that suits both their needs and their employees' preferences.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers to Manage Crowds**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, has started charging visitors who come for just one day. This new fee is a trial to help manage the large number of tourists, especially during busy times. Venice is a very popular destination, but too many visitors can put a strain on the city's infrastructure and the daily lives of its residents.

Visitors aged 14 and over who enter the city for a day trip must pay a five-euro fee. This rule applies on certain peak days and requires tourists to book their visit online in advance. The aim is to reduce overcrowding, protect the city's unique beauty, and make it more pleasant for everyone, including the people who live there.

This new policy has created discussion. Some people believe it is necessary to protect Venice for the future, while others worry it might discourage tourists or be difficult to manage. The city hopes this step will help preserve its culture and environment for generations to come.`;
