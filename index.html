            <h1>President Hopes to Raise Salaries for Nurses with Increased Health Insurance Budget</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te said today that this year's total budget for the National Health Insurance (NHI) is 928.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars. He hopes that as the NHI payment rates go up, hospitals and clinics will fairly increase the salaries of nurses and other medical staff. This will help improve the entire healthcare system and solve the problem of not having enough workers.</p>
            <p>The President spoke at the opening ceremony of the new Taipei City Medical Association building and an art exhibition celebrating its 80th anniversary. He said that about ten years ago, five main medical fields had very few students. But now, the situation has gotten better. About 90% or more of students choose internal medicine. For obstetrics/gynecology and surgery, it's about 96%. For pediatrics, it's about 80%, and for emergency medicine, it's about 86%, or even up to 90% in some cases.</p>
            <p>The President also said that when he was a lawmaker, he helped pass laws to create a system where medical workers would not face extra legal problems when treating people, if they did not make mistakes. He mentioned that former Minister of Health and Welfare, Chiu Tai-yuan, also helped change the "Medical Act" to make legal punishments more reasonable. In 2022, the "Medical Incident Prevention and Dispute Resolution Act" created a fair system for accountability. This helps medical workers feel more comfortable providing care, which is also better for the public.</p>
            <p>The President remembered that in the past, the NHI Administration's budget was about 600 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This year, the total NHI budget is 928.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which should be the highest ever. This money is not just for doctors' pockets. It is to make the entire healthcare system better, so medical workers have more room to serve people, and people get better quality medical care. This is the main goal.</p>
            <p>The President explained that the government helps pay for nurses' night shifts. Recently, public hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and radiographers, also received a pay raise of about 7% to 11%. Because of this, he hopes that as payment rates increase, medical groups that run hospitals or clinics can fairly raise the salaries of nurses and other staff. This is the only way to solve the problem of not having enough workers.</p>
            <p>The President said that after years of hard work, they have seen good results. But they are not satisfied and will do more. They will launch the "Healthy Taiwan Deep Cultivation Plan," spending almost 50 billion New Taiwan Dollars over five years. This plan will focus on four main areas: making working conditions better for medical staff, training different kinds of talent, developing smart healthcare, and taking on social responsibilities.</p>
            <p>The President said, "Once a doctor, always a doctor." When he was a doctor, he worked directly with people, just like everyone else. After he started working in politics, whether as a lawmaker, mayor, premier, or now as president, he always wanted to improve the healthcare system. He wants to use everyone's skills to help patients and serve the public. This is his goal.</p>

            <h1>Man Dies in Industrial Accident at TSMC Southern Taiwan Science Park</h1>
            <p>On September 11, an accident happened at TSMC's 18B factory in the Southern Taiwan Science Park (Nanke) in Tainan. A 50-year-old man named Mr. Huang, who worked for a contractor, was doing maintenance on a cooling tower. He was hit by a fan and fell into the tower. He was taken to the hospital but died. The Nanke Administration ordered work to stop, and the Tainan District Prosecutors Office examined the body yesterday.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Fire Department received a report at noon on September 11. It said that Mr. Huang, a worker for a contractor at TSMC's 18B factory in Nanke, fell while working on a cooling tower. When rescue workers arrived, Mr. Huang had no signs of life. He was taken to National Cheng Kung University Hospital but could not be saved. The Nanke Administration immediately sent people to check and ordered the work to stop.</p>
            <p>The Nanke Administration investigated and found that Mr. Huang was doing yearly maintenance on the cooling tower. He was hit by a fan and fell about 3 meters to the bottom of the tower. The Tainan District Prosecutors Office examined the body yesterday. They believe he died from severe bleeding in his chest and lungs and low blood pressure shock. His family agreed with this finding.</p>
            <p>Today, the Nanke Administration stated that they will investigate the full reasons for the industrial accident and who is responsible, following the rules of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. They will also pay attention to what happens next.</p>

            <h1>US Conservative Influencer Kirk Assassinated; Widow Promises to Continue His Mission</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 12 â€“ A US conservative activist named Charlie Kirk was recently shot and killed. His widow, Erika, said in a statement today that Kirk's message and mission will be "stronger, bolder, louder, and greater than ever." She added that her "voice will sound like a call to battle around the world."</p>
            <p>According to The Guardian newspaper, Erika Kirk said she strongly believes in her late husband Charlie Kirk's motto: "Never give up." She declared, "We will never give up."</p>
            <p>Kirk was one of the people who started "Turning Point USA," a group for young conservatives. He was shot and killed on September 10 while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. This event was the first stop on "Turning Point USA's" fall college tour. Erika said that even though Kirk died suddenly, the campus tour will still continue.</p>
            <p>Erika spoke today at Kirk's "Turning Point USA" office.</p>
            <p>She said, "In a world full of confusion, doubt, and uncertainty, my husband's voice will live on. It will be louder and clearer than before, and his wisdom will never be forgotten."</p>
            <p>Erika said that Kirk was killed because "he shared a message of love for his country, faith, and God's kindness." She added, "The bad people who killed my husband have no idea what they have done." She continued, "You thought my husband's mission was powerful in the past, but you have no idea how big of a storm you have just started across the country and the whole world."</p>
            <p>Additionally, Erika thanked the police and everyone who helped find the person responsible. She also thanked President Trump and Vice President Vance. She said, "Mr. President, my husband loved you very much, and he knew you felt the same way about him." She added, "Your friendship was wonderful."</p>
