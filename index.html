            <h1>Italy Will Hold a Festival of Modern Ideas, Looking at Doubts About Europe and Phone Addiction</h1>
            <p>The world is full of problems, making people feel worried. The city of Piacenza in northern Italy will hold a "Festival of Modern Ideas." Over 200 experts from different areas will talk about important topics like "doubts about Europe," "not enough water," and "young people using phones too much." They hope to help young people find a good path for the future.</p>
            <p>Piacenza is the hometown of Giorgio Armani, a very famous Italian fashion designer who recently died. This city in northern Italy is known for its art and culture. From the 11th to the 14th, it will host the third "Festival of Modern Ideas." The theme is "Unveiling Life" (VITE SVELATE). There will be over 80 talks about philosophy, music, politics, and religion.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the mayor of Piacenza, Katia Tarasconi, went to Rome. She told international news, like CNA, that this event is becoming more important. Last year, Italy's President Sergio Mattarella came to speak to young people. She said, "Young people are the most important people to talk to at this event. We hope that by discussing many ideas, we can help young people make good choices for their future."</p>
            <p>The mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, also came to show his support. He said that these talks are not just political or cultural events. They also help to make democracy stronger. He added that modern society faces many problems, like the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because of this, we need to think deeply about things.</p>
            <p>Alessandro Fusacchia, the event organizer, said this year's theme is "Unveiling Life." He explained that the world is becoming more complex, and people find it harder to understand themselves and what is happening around them. So, everyone needs to "explore themselves" more deeply.</p>
            <p>The event is working with Tlon, a famous Italian group for philosophy. Andrea Colamedici and Maura Gancitano, who started Tlon, said that the festival will have "philosophy concerts." Famous Italian singers will come to the main square to talk directly with young people.</p>
            <p>The topics discussed at this festival are all about current issues. For example, experts will talk about "not enough water" and "young people using phones too much." The event will also bravely discuss sensitive questions like "Do we still need the European Union?"</p>
            <p>Fusacchia openly said that when he was young, 20 or 30 years ago, a united Europe was everyone's dream. But now, it seems like everything is falling apart. Young people feel "collectively helpless" about Europe, and this is a problem that needs attention.</p>
            <p>The media and news industry is another topic for discussion. The event has invited several experienced Italian journalists. One of them is Cecilia Sala, an Italian female reporter who was once held as a hostage in Iran to be exchanged for prisoners. She will share the difficulties of reporting news from war zones.</p>
            <p>This year, the "International Award for Modern Ideas" will be given to the Chilean writer BenjamÃ­n Labatut. Important international guests expected to attend include Erling Kagge, a famous Norwegian explorer, Megi Fino, the Deputy Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs from Albania, and Marietje Schaake, a former Member of the European Parliament who is an expert in internet security.</p>

            <h1>UK Deputy Prime Minister Rayner Resigns After Being Accused of Tax Evasion, Hurting the Labour Government</h1>
            <p>The Deputy Prime Minister of the UK, Angela Rayner, announced today that she is stepping down. This happened because news reports said she avoided paying taxes when she bought a house in May this year. This broke the rules for government ministers. Her resignation is a big problem for the Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that Angela Rayner, who is 45 years old, recently admitted she paid less tax than she should have when she bought her house. She has also told the UK government's independent advisor on ethics about this.</p>
            <p>In a letter to Keir Starmer, Rayner wrote, "Because of what the investigation found and how it affects my family, I have decided to resign." She also left her jobs as Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p>
            <p>Rayner also said, "I am very sorry that I did not get more professional tax advice." She added that she takes "full responsibility for this mistake."</p>
            <p>Starmer replied that he was "very sad" that Rayner was leaving the government. But he also said, "You are still an important person in our party."</p>
            <p>Earlier news reports said that in May this year, when Rayner bought a flat in southern England, she did not say she owned another property. Because of this, she paid Â£40,000 (about NT$1.64 million) less in stamp duty. Rayner admitted on the 3rd that she had underpaid her taxes.</p>
            <p>Last year, The Guardian newspaper in the UK reported that Rayner came from a poor family in Stockport, Greater Manchester. She became pregnant and left school at 16, and was a grandmother by the age of 37.</p>
            <p>After she was elected as a Member of Parliament in 2015, she quickly became an important figure in politics. She soon became one of the most powerful women in the whole of the UK.</p>
            <p>Rayner is proud to support socialism. But she also knows that she must first be a practical person. One of her favorite sayings is, "Ideology alone cannot feed me."</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Businesspeople in the Philippines Are Being Framed by Bad Groups; Business Association Will Hold a Meeting to Prevent This</h1>
            <p>Recently, there have been reports that Taiwanese businesspeople in the Philippines have been falsely accused by bad groups. To stop more Taiwanese people from being hurt, a Taiwanese business group plans to hold a meeting. They will invite police experts from the Philippines to explain how to stay safe. A Taiwanese businessperson who has lived in the Philippines for many years suggests that people from Taiwan should live quietly so that criminals do not target them.</p>
            <p>Several news outlets in the Philippines recently reported that a Taiwanese person doing business in Subic was tricked and framed. Because of this, 11 Filipinos involved are now facing many criminal charges. These include a current prosecutor, a deputy prosecutor, a retired judge, and a police officer who was fired. These reports have been shared among Taiwanese communities.</p>
            <p>The Manila Times reported on September 1st that a 39-year-old woman and her 17-year-old daughter were used by this group. They falsely accused the Taiwanese businessperson of sexual assault. The group wanted 5 million pesos (about NT$2.69 million) as a settlement payment.</p>
            <p>On August 15th, a local Philippine newspaper, the Nueva Ecija Chronicle, broadcasted the girl's confession. She clearly said that the Taiwanese businessperson did not sexually assault her. She accused the group of faking her mother's signature on the legal complaint to falsely accuse the businessperson.</p>
            <p>Subic used to be a US naval base. It is about 136 kilometers from Manila. Now, it is one of the Philippines' important economic zones. Over 1,800 businesses are located there, and many foreigners live in the area.</p>
            <p>Chang Che-chia, the head of the Taiwanese Business Association in Subic Bay, told CNA that he had heard about similar incidents happening to foreign businesspeople before. He said that even when foreign businesspeople are wrongly accused, they often have to pay money to solve the problem. Because of this, Taiwanese businesspeople living in Subic are very careful.</p>
            <p>Chang Che-chia plans to invite a high-ranking police officer to lead a meeting at the business association in late September or early October. The officer will explain how to protect oneself to prevent other Taiwanese businesspeople from becoming victims. The association will meet with this police officer tomorrow for an initial discussion.</p>
            <p>Lin Nan-hung, an advisor to the Young Entrepreneurs Committee of the Federation of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in the Philippines, told CNA that it is good to live a simple life in the Philippines. He said that avoiding places of entertainment can prevent many unnecessary problems. He explained that if foreigners live a fancy lifestyle, they might become easy targets for criminals.</p>
            <p>Lin Nan-hung, who has been in the Philippines for 10 years, said that if you are falsely accused or have an accident, you can call the emergency help number of the Taiwan Representative Office in the Philippines. You can also ask for help from Taiwanese business organizations, or join related Facebook groups or LINE groups in the Philippines to get legal advice from experienced people.</p>
            <p>He said, "When you are away from home, you should always keep a low profile. It is also a good idea to connect with local business groups that are well-established and have a good reputation."</p>
