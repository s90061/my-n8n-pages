        <h2>Los Angeles Taiwanese Remember Chen Wan-chen, a Brave Leader</h2>
        <p>In Los Angeles, more than 20 Taiwanese people held a special meeting to remember Chen Wan-chen, a former member of Taiwan's parliament who died on June 11th. She was 75 years old. Friends said she was a very brave leader, especially in the 1980s when it was dangerous to speak up.</p>
        <p>Chen Wan-chen lived in the United States for about 10 years, from 1979 to 1989. During that time, she wrote books, opened a bookstore, and organized events to help Taiwan become a democracy. She was a talented writer and a journalist who always fought for what was right.</p>
        <p>People who knew her said she always believed in Taiwan becoming independent, even when it was very risky. Her courage helped many people wake up and work for Taiwan's democracy, both inside Taiwan and abroad. One friend said knowing her changed his whole life.</p>

        <h2>National Railway Museum Opens Its First Part on July 31st</h2>
        <p>The National Railway Museum in Taiwan will open its first part on July 31st. It took nine years to fix the old buildings and prepare everything. Six old buildings will be open to visitors. These include the power plant, the main office, and the training center for mechanics.</p>
        <p>The museum is located at the old Taipei Machine Factory. This factory was very important because it used to fix, put together, and take care of Taiwan's trains. In 2015, the entire factory, which is almost 17 hectares, became a national historical site.</p>
        <p>The museum will have different exhibitions, including a permanent one about trains and how they moved people, and special shows about Taiwan's railway history and photography. There will also be a special area for children. A long path, 335 meters long, will also open, allowing people to walk through the museum area and see the old buildings.</p>

        <h2>Istanbul Pride Parade Banned, Over 50 People Arrested</h2>
        <p>In Istanbul, Turkey, more than 50 people were arrested before an LGBTQ+ Pride Parade. The parade was not allowed to happen this year. The Istanbul Bar Association said that four of their lawyers and over 50 other people were taken by the police without good reason.</p>
        <p>Police blocked Taksim Square, which is a common place for protests and celebrations in Istanbul. The Pride Parade has been banned every year since 2015 by the government in Turkey. The governor of Istanbul had warned that any gatherings that might "harm social peace" would not be allowed.</p>
        <p>Even though it is not a crime to be gay in Turkey, many people have negative feelings towards LGBTQ+ people. Even the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, often speaks against the LGBTQ+ community, saying they are a danger to traditional families.</p>
