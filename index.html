https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nn9x87edpo

The cost of living in the UK is growing more slowly. In April, prices rose by 2.3%, which is the lowest rate in almost three years. This happened mainly because energy bills for homes went down a lot. This news from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) means that inflation is now very close to the Bank of England's goal of 2%. However, food prices are still quite high, which continues to make daily life expensive for many families. Even though the overall drop in inflation is good news, experts say that people's wages are not growing as fast. This means families might not feel much better financially right away. The Bank of England will use these numbers to help them decide whether to change interest rates.

**AI Will Change Jobs, Not Always Replace Them, Say Experts**

Many people are worried about how artificial intelligence (AI) will affect jobs as it gets better. But recently, experts at a meeting said that AI will probably change how we work, rather than take away all human jobs. AI is good at doing tasks that are repeated often. However, skills like being creative, thinking deeply, and understanding emotions are still special to humans. These skills will become even more important. In the future workplace, people and AI will likely work together. Employees will need to learn new skills to work well with these new technologies. This change could create new types of jobs and help us produce more work.

**Europe's Popular Travel Spots Face Too Many Tourists and Climate Change**

https://edition.cnn.com/travel/europe-overtourism-climate-change-greece-spain-italy/index.html

Popular places to visit in Europe are finding it harder to manage the problem of too many tourists. This "overtourism" can harm local people, the environment, and public services. Countries like Greece, Spain, and Italy are seeing many more visitors. This puts stress on their natural areas and old historical sites. Besides having too many people, climate change is also a bigger worry. It is changing when and where people travel, and how attractive some places are. To deal with this, some well-known travel spots are trying new ideas. These include allowing fewer visitors, asking people to travel outside the busiest seasons, and promoting greener ways to travel. Their goal is to protect their history and make visits better for everyone, both locals and tourists.`;
