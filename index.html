The 2025 Overseas Youth English Service Camp held its training graduation ceremony today at Asia University. 415 volunteers will go to schools across Taiwan to teach English. Hsu Chia-ching, the head of the Overseas Community Affairs Council, hopes these young people's efforts will be successful and open up students' views of the world.

Many important people attended the ceremony, including Hsu Chia-ching, Xiao Yizhi from the Ministry of Education, Chen Rui-rong from the Hakka Affairs Council, Hsu Yun-ru from Miaoli County Government, Asia University President Tsai Jin-fa, and Central News Agency President Hu Wan-ling. Volunteers from 22 countries shared their training experiences and fun stories about dealing with Typhoon Danas. They are now looking forward to teaching English.

Hsu Chia-ching said that the 5-day training brought together young volunteers from 22 countries. She believes that the next two weeks of service, whether in mountains, by the sea, in villages, or cities, will give them many new experiences. She hopes the young people will find their purpose through service and make their contributions grow. She also hopes they will be creative in schools, helping students learn about different cultures and see their future. She also wants the volunteers to enjoy Taiwan's food, beautiful places, and friendly people.
