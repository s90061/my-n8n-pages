            <h1>Japan's Prime Minister Announces "Indo-African Economic Zone Plan" to Compete with China</h1>
            <p>The 9th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) started yesterday in Yokohama. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba presented a new economic idea called the "Indo-African Economic Zone Plan." China's influence in Africa is growing, so Japan wants to create a fair economic zone to help Africa grow.</p>
            <p>According to Jiji Press, TICAD9, which lasts for three days, began yesterday afternoon in Yokohama. Ishiba announced the new economic plan.</p>
            <p>Ishiba talked about the old connections within this economic area. He said, "This economic area has many young people and a lot of energy resources. It is becoming more important as a region that can achieve high economic growth." He hopes to help Africa grow by making stronger connections and creating a fair economic zone.</p>
            <p>He also said he will talk about the "Indo-African Economic Zone Plan" with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will visit at the end of the month.</p>
            <p>The report says that Ishiba's "Indo-African Economic Zone Plan" is part of Japan's goal to achieve a "free and open Indo-Pacific." This plan includes using Official Development Assistance (ODA) well and connecting with businesses from other countries. It also aims to find ways to deal with high tariffs from US President Donald Trump's government.</p>
            <p>The Asahi Shimbun reported that the "Indo-African Economic Zone Plan" wants to make stronger economic connections between India, Indian Ocean island countries, and Africa. More Japanese companies are sending goods to Africa from their bases in India or China. This plan can help these companies work more with businesses from other countries and increase investment in Africa.</p>
            <p>Ishiba also stated that Japan will provide Official Development Assistance (ODA) to improve the "Nacala Corridor." This corridor connects copper-producing countries in inland Africa to the east coast. Also, Japan will improve connections within and outside Africa to make sure there is a good supply of mineral resources.</p>
            <p>Ishiba shared his experience of visiting Senegal 25 years ago and talking with students there. He said, "The key to Africa becoming a center of growth is to help young people and women become stronger and make sure they have jobs."</p>
            <p>Ishiba hopes to train 30,000 people in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the next three years. For GAVI, an international group that helps provide vaccines in developing countries, Japan will give up to 550 million US dollars (about 16.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars) over the next five years.</p>
            <p>In addition, Japan and the African Development Bank (AfDB) are thinking about giving more support to private businesses, offering up to 5.5 billion US dollars in financial help.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that in previous years, the Japanese government announced a total investment goal from both government and private sectors, but this year it did not. At the last TICAD8 meeting in 2022, then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced 30 billion US dollars in government and private investment over the next three years.</p>
            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is a co-chair of TICAD9. Former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is the acting chair, and Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya also attended. Other people present included 33 leaders from Africa and representatives from 49 countries, as well as international groups, businesses, lawmakers, and community leaders. The main topic of TICAD9 is "Finding solutions to problems together."</p>
            <p>TICAD is an international meeting led by the Japanese government since 1993. It now takes place every three years. Ishiba said in his speech yesterday, "Since TICAD started in 1993, Japan has always believed in Africa's future. Africa is a partner we can trust."</p>

            <h1>India Successfully Tests "Agni-5" Nuclear Missile, Can Reach All of China</h1>
            <p>New Delhi, August 20 (AFP) â€“ India announced today that it has successfully tested a medium-range ballistic missile. When this missile is used, it can carry nuclear warheads that can reach all parts of China.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the "Agni-5" missile was successfully tested in Odisha, eastern India. Officials said the missile "proved all its operational and technical features."</p>
            <p>The "Agni-5" missile is one of a group of medium to short-range ballistic missiles developed by India itself. It is meant to make India's defense stronger against Pakistan and China.</p>
            <p>India and China are the two most populated countries in the world. They are strongly competing for power in South Asia. The relationship between the two countries got much worse after a deadly conflict at their border in 2020.</p>
            <p>India is also a member of the "Quad" security group, which is seen as a way to balance China's power. The other members are the United States, Australia, and Japan.</p>
            <p>Pakistan, India's old enemy, also has nuclear weapons. In May this year, armed groups attacked the Kashmir region, which is controlled by India. 26 people died. India blamed the government in Islamabad, but Pakistan said it was not involved. The two countries were close to war at that time.</p>
            <p>However, both India and China are now trying to fix their relationship. This is because of global trade and political problems caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.</p>
            <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in five years at a meeting in Russia last October.</p>
            <p>Modi is expected to visit China later this month for a summit of the regional security group, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. This will be his first visit to China since 2018.</p>
            <p>The relationship between New Delhi and Washington is tense because President Trump told India to stop buying Russian oil. Russia is currently fighting in Ukraine, and oil is a very important source of money for Russia.</p>
            <p>The United States said that if India does not change its oil supplier, the US will double the current 25% tariff on India to 50% by August 27.</p>
