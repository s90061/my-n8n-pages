            <h1>Zelenskyy: Gaza Ceasefire Gives Hope for End to Russia-Ukraine War</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy praised the "special" ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. He said it makes him hopeful that Russia's full attack on Ukraine can also end. He believes leaders like US President Trump can help make this happen.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote on social media: "When peace happens in one part of the world, it gives more hope for peace in other places."</p>
            <p>He also added: "If a ceasefire and peace can happen in the Middle East, then the strong actions and decisions of world leaders can definitely help us in Ukraine too."</p>
            <p>In February 2022, Russia started a full invasion of Ukraine. This caused the biggest war in Europe since the end of World War II. Russia has said no to ceasefire requests many times. It has asked for tough conditions, mostly wanting Kyiv to give up to get peace.</p>
            <p>Former US President Trump once promised to stop the Russia-Ukraine war within hours of becoming president. However, even after many talks by the US and meetings between Trump and Russian President Putin, there has been no clear progress toward a peace agreement for Russia and Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>13 Financial Groups in Taiwan Made NT$69 Billion in September, 80% More Than Last Year</h1>
            <p>The US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in September. This made the stock market better. Because of this, 13 financial groups in Taiwan earned 69.011 billion New Taiwan Dollars after tax in September. This is 87.6% more than last year. If we add the profits of Shin Kong Financial before it merged, all the financial groups together earned 403.282 billion New Taiwan Dollars in the first nine months. This is 19.5% less than last year.</p>
            <p>According to public information, the 13 financial groups earned 432.829 billion New Taiwan Dollars in the first nine months. But, if we subtract the 29.547 billion New Taiwan Dollars that Shin Kong Financial lost in the first six months, the total profit for all financial groups for the first nine months is 403.282 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The profits of the 13 financial groups in the first nine months show two different stories. Many life insurance financial groups earned less because the exchange rate was very strong in the first half of the year. But, other groups like CTBC Financial, E.SUN Financial, E.SUN Financial, First Financial, Hua Nan Financial, Chang Hwa Bank Financial, and Taiwan Cooperative Financial grew compared to last year. These groups mainly focus on banking.</p>
            <p>However, Fubon Financial, which is a life insurance financial group, was still number one. It earned the most profit in September, the most in the first nine months, and had the highest earnings per share (EPS).</p>
            <p>Fubon Financial announced its after-tax profit for September was 17.44 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Its total after-tax profit for the first nine months was 90.92 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is almost 25% less than last year. But its total EPS was 6.38 New Taiwan Dollars, which is still the best in the industry. Fubon Financial and its companies like Fubon Life, Taipei Fubon Bank, Fubon Securities, and Fubon Insurance all had their highest monthly profits for September ever. Taipei Fubon Bank also had its highest profit for the first nine months ever.</p>
            <p>Fubon Financial explained that Taipei Fubon Bank's after-tax profit in September was 3.43 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Its profit for the first nine months was 29.17 billion New Taiwan Dollars. These amounts are 28% and 16% higher than last year, respectively. Both the September and total profits are the highest ever. This is because interest earnings and service fee earnings both grew by more than 10% in the first nine months. Also, loans to people overseas, small and medium businesses, and individuals grew. This made the bank's total loan amount grow by 10% in one year.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial's after-tax profit in September was 9.74 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Its after-tax profit for the first nine months was 74.78 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is 27.5% less than last year. Its EPS was 4.83 New Taiwan Dollars, making it second in the industry. Cathay Financial said that Cathay United Bank, Cathay Century Insurance, and Cathay Securities Investment Trust all had their highest after-tax profits for the first nine months ever. Cathay Securities had its second-highest profit for the first nine months ever.</p>
            <p>CTBC Financial's after-tax profit in September was 11.179 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Its after-tax profit for the first nine months was 60.759 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is 3.6% more than last year. Its EPS was 3.06 New Taiwan Dollars. CTBC Bank had stable deposits and loans, and its wealth management business was strong. This helped its profit for the first nine months reach 42.057 billion New Taiwan Dollars, 16% more than last year, and its highest ever for this period. Its company, Taiwan Life, made some money from selling Taiwan stocks, which helped its September profit. However, its profit for the first nine months was 17.74 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is less than last year because of more losses from currency exchange.</p>
            <p>KGI Financial announced its September profit was 4.528 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Its after-tax profit for the first nine months was 19.05 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is 34.6% less than last year. Its EPS was 1.09 New Taiwan Dollars. KGI Financial said that when the US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in September, it helped the stock market. KGI Bank and KGI Securities gave more than 80% of the cash dividends to the financial group last year. Because these businesses did well, their combined after-tax profit for the first nine months of this year was 13.458 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is 7% more than last year. This will help the financial group pay dividends in the future.</p>
            <p>Yuanta Financial announced its September profit was 3.417 billion New Taiwan Dollars, 41.4% more than last year. Its after-tax profit for the first nine months was 26.695 billion New Taiwan Dollars, 1.5% less than last year. Its EPS was 2 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Taishin Shin Kong Financial's profit includes the original Taishin Financial profit and Shin Kong's profit after the merger. Taishin Shin Kong Financial's total after-tax profit for September was 7.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars, its highest ever for a single month. Its profit for the first nine months was 26.04 billion New Taiwan Dollars, also a record high. Its EPS was 1.51 New Taiwan Dollars. Taishin Bank earned 1.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars in September, and its profit for the first nine months was 15.46 billion New Taiwan Dollars, continuing to reach new highs.</p>
            <p>E.SUN Financial's after-tax profit in September was 2.897 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Its after-tax profit for the first nine months was 26.202 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is a new record for this period, 25.5% more than last year. It has already made more profit than its total for 2024, which was 26.084 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Its overall profit is very strong. Its EPS was 1.62 New Taiwan Dollars. E.SUN Financial explained that its bank, securities, venture capital, and investment trust companies all made more profit in the first nine months than last year. E.SUN Bank's net interest income grew by 18.9%, its highest ever for this period.</p>
            <p>For the four big state-owned financial groups: Mega Financial's after-tax profit for the first nine months was 28.285 billion New Taiwan Dollars, 3.5% less than last year. Its EPS was 1.91 New Taiwan Dollars, still the highest among state-owned groups. First Financial's after-tax profit for the first nine months was 21.699 billion New Taiwan Dollars, 4.3% more than last year. Hua Nan Financial's after-tax profit for the first nine months was 19.91 billion New Taiwan Dollars, 11.5% more than last year. Taiwan Cooperative Financial's after-tax profit for the first nine months was 16.238 billion New Taiwan Dollars, 0.1% more than last year.</p>

            <h1>High-Speed Rail Removes "Quiet Car" Signs to Prevent Misunderstandings, Will Plan New Promotions</h1>
            <p>Taiwan High-Speed Rail (THSR) said today that it removed the "Quiet Car" signs from the backs of train seats yesterday. Now, there are new cards that say "Enjoy THSR, Travel Quietly Together." THSR will also think of new ways to tell people about this rule.</p>
            <p>THSR started its "Quiet Car" rule on September 22, which caused some discussion. Some people wondered if the signs meant they couldn't make any noise at all. THSR said it has also taken down the promotional cards on the sales trolleys. Staff will no longer hold up signs. Now, THSR will only tell people about the rule using the electronic displays on the train, at the stations, and on its official website.</p>
            <p>THSR explained that making the quiet car quieter is for people who talk on the phone or use electronic devices without headphones, which bothers other passengers. For babies, young children, or passengers who cannot control their actions due to illness or other clear reasons, the staff will always show care, help them, and comfort them.</p>
            <p>THSR said it will continue to listen to and understand the opinions of families traveling with children recently. It will also improve how its staff helps passengers to avoid misunderstandings. They will also give more care and help to passengers who need it.</p>
