            <h1>Three-Year Navy Service: A Story of the Legendary Ships Yukikaze and Dan Yang</h1>
            <p>Huang Zheng-xing, a fruit farmer from Changhua, was born during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. When he served in the navy, he was assigned to the destroyer "Yukikaze." This ship was given to the Republic of China by Japan after World War II. By chance, he became one of the last sailors on the ship after it was renamed "Dan Yang," protecting Taiwan's waters.</p>
            <p>Eighty years after World War II ended, a Japanese movie called "Yukikaze YUKIKAZE" came out on August 15th. The movie tells the story of the Japanese navy destroyer Yukikaze during the war. It ends with the ship's captain, played by Takenouchi Yutaka, saying that the ship will be given to the United Nations. Historically, Yukikaze was the only ship of its kind in the Japanese navy that survived from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the end of the war. After the war, the Republic of China Navy took over the Yukikaze and renamed it "Dan Yang" (with the number DD-12). In the 1950s, it became an important ship for the navy.</p>
            <p>Chen Li-hang, a researcher of Taiwan's history during Japanese rule, went to Japan in August. He took part in a memorial event for people who stayed in Siberia after World War II, and he also watched the "Yukikaze" movie. He said that this movie is different from other Japanese war movies because it focuses on "we want to come back alive." The Republic of China is only shown in the last scene, where Yukikaze's anchor, which is still kept today, is shown. A sign next to it mentions the Republic of China Navy.</p>
            <p>Huang Zheng-xing was born in 1943, during the Showa era of Japanese rule. He finished school at Yongjing Agricultural School. When he drew lots for his military service, he got the navy. For a farming family that needed people to work, this was not good luck. This was because navy service was one year longer than army service at that time (navy and air force served for 3 years, army for 2 years). However, he remembered that food in the countryside was generally not good back then. He also saw that a person from the next village who served in the navy looked "healthy and well-fed." So, he changed his mind and thought that being in the navy might be good after all.</p>
            <p>In October 1963, Huang Zheng-xing joined the navy for a three-year mandatory service. He was part of the 94th group of navy sailors. He went to the Naval Non-Commissioned Officer School at Zuoying Base for four months of basic training. At that time, soldiers were already divided into groups based on their future roles on the ship, such as gunnery, telecommunications, mines, and communications. He was assigned to the gunnery group. Every day, his classes included four hours of specialized training in the morning and two hours of drills like marching in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Today, Huang Zheng-xing runs a grape farm. The grape season has just finished, but his family is still working hard under the grapevines. They are cutting branches and preparing the land for next year's grape harvest.</p>
            <p>"Training was easier than farming," Huang Zheng-xing said when interviewed by CNA, remembering his basic training days. He mentioned that the food in the army was much better than the food at home in the countryside.</p>
            <p>Because he was a gunner, Huang Zheng-xing was given the job of managing the ammunition storage on the Dan Yang ship. The Dan Yang had six ammunition rooms. These rooms stored ammunition for the main guns, secondary guns, anti-aircraft guns, small weapons, pistols, and rifles. His supervisor strongly told him that this was an important job. Every afternoon, he had to check if the temperature in each ammunition room was over 34 degrees Celsius. If it was, he needed to tell the vice-captain. If the temperature was too high, there were sprinklers inside the rooms to cool them down.</p>
            <p>Huang Zheng-xing explained that during his time managing the ship's ammunition rooms, the temperature went over 34 degrees only once. After he reported it, the captain told him that "it's okay if the temperature is only high for one day." So, they did not use the sprinklers.</p>
            <p>Huang Zheng-xing said that the sailors on the ship called the Dan Yang "Old Dan." There were almost 200 sailors on the ship. They were divided into groups based on their jobs, such as navigation, engineering, telecommunications, signals, deck crew, and gunnery. Since he was a gunner, he was in the gunnery team. There were about 10 soldiers in his team, and the team leader was a squad leader. During battles, his job was to help move and load shells. On normal days, their main base was Zuoying. They would go to Penghu, Keelung, and Kinmen to patrol or guard supply ships going to Nansha and Kinmen. He remembers never going to Matsu.</p>
            <p>Huang Zheng-xing mentioned that in the 1960s, the navy's main ships were American-made Yang-class destroyers. Compared to these newer ships, the Dan Yang was already old. It was planned to be retired, and its condition was getting worse. One of its three boilers was broken, and it was not fixed. So, the ship could only sail using two boilers, and its top speed was only a bit over 20 knots. After the Dan Yang's 13th anniversary ceremony in October 1965, the ship stopped sailing. They started to unload the ammunition and equipment from the ship. "It took more than 30 trucks to move everything," he said.</p>
            <p>Huang Zheng-xing remembered that the Dan Yang then became a training ship in Zuoying for several years and never sailed again. After that, he was moved to the Huashan frigate, which had just been given to Taiwan by the United States. He served on the Huashan for about 6 to 7 months. Finally, he retired in October 1966.</p>

            <h1>Kim Jong Un Meets Putin, Promises Full Support for Russia</h1>
            <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un promised today to fully support Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said he is ready to "do everything I can to help" Moscow. Putin, on his part, thanked North Korea for sending troops to help fight Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this meeting happened during an event in Beijing. The event was to celebrate the "80th Anniversary of the Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War."</p>
            <p>Before this, Putin and Kim Jong Un also went with Chinese President Xi Jinping to a big military parade. This was the first time leaders from these three countries met together since the early Cold War.</p>
            <p>After the military parade, Kim Jong Un and Putin shared a car to Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. There, they had a private meeting just between the two of them.</p>
            <p>Kim Jong Un told Putin, "If there is anything I can or must do for you and the Russian people, I see it as a duty between brothers."</p>
            <p>Putin called Kim Jong Un "Dear Chairman of the State Affairs Commission" in Russian. He also gave his warmest greetings.</p>
            <p>Putin said, "Recently, the relationship between our two countries has become a special, trusting, and friendly alliance." He praised the North Korean special forces sent to Ukraine to help the Russian military. He said, "Your soldiers have shown courage and fearlessness."</p>
            <p>He added, "I want to stress that we will never forget the sacrifices made by your armed forces and military families."</p>

            <h1>Japan's Government Bond Yields and International Gold Prices Reach New Highs, Most Asian Stocks Close Lower</h1>
            <p>Today, a global sell-off of government bonds spread to Asia. The yield on Japan's 30-year government bonds reached its highest point ever. At the same time, international gold prices also hit a new record. This happened as investors worried about the financial future of many countries, including the US and Japan. Most Asian stock markets closed lower today.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that on September 2nd, Moriyama Hiroshi, the second most powerful person in Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said he wanted to resign as secretary-general. This was because the LDP lost badly in the July Upper House election. After this, Japanese investors are also worried that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba might have to leave office soon.</p>
            <p>Most major stock markets in Asia closed lower today. Tokyo's market fell by 0.88%, and Shanghai's market also dropped by 1.16%.</p>
            <p>Japan's 30-year government bond yield rose to 3.29%, which is the highest it has ever been. The 20-year government bond yield also reached 2.69%, the highest since 1999.</p>
            <p>Stephen Innes, a strategist at SPI Asset Management, wrote in a report: "The impact of Japan's 30-year government bond yield going over 3.25% could be much more damaging than Japan's internal political problems."</p>
            <p>Innes also pointed out that when Japan's government bond yields pass an important level, "it not only makes Japanese savers worried, but it also makes insurance companies, pension funds, and foreign currency reserve managers around the world change their plans. Once these changes start to affect other things, stock markets all over the world will feel the impact."</p>
            <p>In addition, the 30-year government bond yield in the United States went above 5% at one point. The 30-year government bond yield in the United Kingdom reached its highest level since 1998. The 30-year government bond yield in France also went up quickly to 4.5% for the first time since 2009.</p>
            <p>Investors continue to move their money to safe assets like gold. This pushed the international price of gold to $3546.96 per ounce at one point, which is a new record high.</p>
