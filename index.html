            <h1>Taipei Court Checks Recordings of Former Official Peng Zhen-sheng in Jinghua City Case</h1>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is hearing the Jinghua City case. Today, the court looked at the recordings and videos of former Taipei Deputy Mayor Peng Zhen-sheng's questioning during the investigation. The court called former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, who is in custody, and Peng Zhen-sheng to be present. Shen Ching-ching and Huang Jing-mao, who are also involved in the case, also asked to be there.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office finished investigating the Jinghua City case and Ko Wen-je's political donation case at the end of last December. They accused former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, Wei-Ching Group Chairman Shen Ching-ching, and 9 other people of crimes like taking bribes, making illegal profits, taking public money, and breaking trust. The prosecutors asked for a total prison sentence of 28 years and 6 months for Ko Wen-je.</p>
            <p>In April this year, Ko Wen-je's lawyer said that Peng Zhen-sheng and others might have been questioned unfairly by the prosecutors. The lawyer claimed that the records of the questioning were not consistent and could not be used as evidence. Especially, the lawyer pointed out that during Peng Zhen-sheng's questioning, the prosecutor said, "Are you willing to be Yu Wen now?" This clearly showed that the prosecutor wanted Peng Zhen-sheng to accuse Ko Wen-je, which is a type of unfair questioning.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court had planned to check Peng Zhen-sheng's interrogation recordings and videos on July 1st and call him to testify. However, Peng Zhen-sheng asked for time off because his wife passed away, so his testimony was moved to July 26th. But on July 26th, Peng Zhen-sheng was still sad, so his questioning was moved again to September 2nd. If it cannot be finished in one day, the court will continue on September 4th. Today, the court is checking Peng Zhen-sheng's interrogation recordings and videos.</p>

            <h1>Nvidia's Stock Drops After Hours Due to Worries About China Business; Experts Say It Could Affect Taiwan's Stock Market</h1>
            <p>On August 27th, US stocks closed higher. The S&P 500 index reached a new high of 6481.4 points. TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) went up by 0.24%. However, experts said that Nvidia's stock dropped by more than 3% after the market closed. This happened because investors are worried that Nvidia's business in China might slow down. TSMC's ADR also fell by over 1.5% after hours. This could be bad for Taiwan's stock market.</p>
            <p>All the main US stock indexes went up on August 27th. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 147.16 points, which is a 0.32% increase. The S&P 500 index went up by 15.46 points, or 0.24%, and closed at a new high of 6481.4 points. The Nasdaq index increased by 45.87 points, or 0.21%, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose by 16.69 points, or 0.29%.</p>
            <p>In other business news from Taiwan and abroad, Nvidia, a top company for AI chips, shared its financial report after the market closed. Its earnings and future predictions were better than what experts expected. In the second quarter, its income reached a new high of 46.7 billion US dollars. For the third quarter, the company expects its income to be around 54 billion US dollars, plus or minus 2%. This is more than the 53.14 billion US dollars that experts had predicted.</p>
            <p>Nvidia did not ship its H20 chips to China in the second quarter. The company also said that its predictions for the third quarter do not include any planned shipments of H20 chips to China. Investors are worried that Nvidia's business in China might stop growing, which caused its stock price to fall by more than 3% after the market closed.</p>
            <p>Experts said that TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR), which is the main maker of Nvidia's chips, dropped by more than 1.5% after the market closed. Other AI-related stocks like AMD and Super Micro also fell after hours. This could have a negative effect on Taiwan's stock market.</p>

            <h1>Key Person for Czech Exile Literature Dies, Published Over 200 Books Abroad</h1>
            <p>Zdena Salivarov√°, a Czech writer, translator, and founder of a publishing house, passed away on August 25th at the age of 91. In 1971, she and her husband started "68 Publishers" in Canada. They published over 200 books by writers who had left Czechoslovakia. Her work is a very important part of Czech exile literature history.</p>
            <p>In her younger years, Czech writer Zdena Salivarov√° was known as a singer and actress, not just for her writing. She met the famous writer Josef ≈†kvoreck√Ω, and they got married in 1958.</p>
            <p>In 1968, when the Soviet Union entered Czechoslovakia, Salivarov√° and her husband were in the United States. They decided to stay abroad and later moved to Canada. There, they started "68 Publishers." In 1990, they received the Order of the White Lion for their important contributions to Czech literature.</p>
            <p>Ivana Tomkov√°, an editor for French literature at Argo, a Czech publishing house, said that the events of 1968 greatly affected Salivarov√°'s life, just like they affected many people from Czechoslovakia. Over the next 20 years, "68 Publishers" released more than 200 books by writers who had left Czechoslovakia, as well as books that were not allowed to be published in their home country.</p>
            <p>These published works included the Czech version of Milan Kundera's "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," former Czech President V√°clav Havel's "Plays 1970‚Äì1976," Czech Nobel Prize winner Jaroslav Seifert's "All the Beauty in the World," Bohumil Hrabal's "Weddings in the House," and Ivan Divi≈°'s collection of poems "The End of Happiness" (Konec ≈°tƒõst√≠).</p>
            <p>Tomkov√° said that Salivarov√° gave almost all her life and energy to the publishing house. "I believe that many books and writers would have been forgotten without her," Tomkov√° said. "They published works by writers who were living in exile and works that were not allowed in Czechoslovakia at that time. These books were later secretly brought back into the country. So, their work filled a very big empty space that would have otherwise existed."</p>
            <p>Besides being the main person behind the publishing house, Salivarov√° was also a writer herself. Her novel "Honzlov√°" is considered one of the most important Czech literary works of the 20th century. This book is a semi-autobiographical novel. It tells the story of a young woman's struggles and problems in Czechoslovakia during the 1950s, a time when the government had complete control.</p>
            <p>Tomkov√° commented, "Even though she did not publish many of her own works, her novel 'Honzlov√°' is truly one of the best works in Czech literature of the 20th century."</p>
            <p>After her husband Josef ≈†kvoreck√Ω passed away in 2012, Salivarov√° continued to live in Toronto. After the Velvet Revolution, she often visited the Czech Republic. All her life, she worked hard to make sure that the voices of Czech writers who had left their home country were remembered and passed on.</p>
