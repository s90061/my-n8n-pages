In June, Russia attacked Ukraine with more than 5,000 long-range drones. This is the highest number of drones launched in one month since the war started in February 2022. In May, Russia used 3,974 drones.

Also, new information shows that Russia has been taking more land in Ukraine for three months in a row. In June, they took 588 square kilometers. This is more than in May (507 sq km), April (379 sq km), and March (240 sq km).

This month's land gains are almost as high as the biggest gains made in October (610 sq km) and November (725 sq km) last year, not counting the first few months of the war.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones attacked a Russian city far from the front lines, causing 3 deaths and 35 injuries. This attack was over 1,000 kilometers from the war zone and hit a city where weapons are made, including a drone factory.

**Storms Stop High-Speed Trains Between France and Italy**

High-speed trains between France and Italy will not run for at least a few days. This is because a strong storm hit the area earlier this week.

The French railway company, SNCF, said they need to clean and check the tracks between Paris and Milan. This is to make sure there is no damage that could stop trains from running again.

The storm caused a lot of mud to cover the tracks near Modane station in the Maurienne Valley, close to the French border. The station also got flooded. Because of this, trains on this route stopped running yesterday afternoon.

The town of Modane had some property damage from the floods, but luckily, no one was hurt.
