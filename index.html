The Palestinian group Hamas said today that they are ready to talk "immediately" about a ceasefire in Gaza. This announcement comes as the war in Gaza reaches its 21st month.

Hamas released a statement saying they are ready to seriously take part in talks. These talks would be about how to put into action the ceasefire plan supported by the United States. Hamas's friend, Islamic Jihad, also said they support the talks. But they want a promise that Israel will not attack again after the hostages in Gaza are set free.

Previously, there were two ceasefires between Israel and Hamas. Qatar, Egypt, and the US helped make these happen. During those times, fighting stopped for a short period, and Israeli hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu promised to bring back all the hostages held in Gaza.

**Trump and Zelenskyy Talk About Weapons and Russia's Attacks**

Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said today that he spoke with U.S. President Trump. They talked about air defense. They agreed to make Ukraine better at protecting its sky as Russia's attacks become stronger.

Zelenskyy also said he and Trump talked about working together to make defense products, and about buying and investing together. Ukraine has asked Washington to sell more Patriot missiles and systems. Ukraine believes these are very important to protect them from Russia's increasing air attacks.

Washington decided to stop sending some weapons to Ukraine. This made Ukraine worried, saying it would weaken their ability to defend against Russian attacks. Germany said it is talking about buying Patriot air defense systems to help. After a "very good" talk between the two presidents, there is hope that Patriot missile supplies can start again. Zelenskyy said he and Trump agreed to have their teams meet to make air defense stronger.
