            <h1>Trump to Talk with Xi Jinping About TikTok</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump held a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. During the conference, he said that he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping tomorrow about who owns the popular video app, TikTok.</p>
            <p>Trump has put off banning TikTok several times. A law says TikTok must be sold by its Chinese owner, ByteDance, for national security reasons. Earlier this week, Trump announced that a deal had been made and that he would speak with Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>At the press conference, Trump, who is visiting the UK, said, "We will speak with President Xi on the 19th. We will see if we can finish things about TikTok because it is very valuable."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that he believes TikTok helped him become more popular with young voters, which helped him win the 2024 election.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Fall Due to Worries About US Economy, Despite Rate Cut</h1>
            <p>International oil prices went down today. This happened because investors are still worried about the U.S. economy. This is true even after the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates for the first time this year yesterday.</p>
            <p>Brent crude oil futures dropped by 51 cents, or 0.8%, ending the day at $67.44 per barrel.</p>
            <p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil also fell by 48 cents, or 0.8%, closing at $63.57 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>UN Security Council to Vote on New Sanctions Against Iran's Nuclear Program</h1>
            <p>The UN Security Council will vote tomorrow on whether to put sanctions back on Iran's nuclear program. This vote will happen because the UK, France, and Germany have suggested it.</p>
            <p>In 2015, many countries, including the U.S., UK, France, and Germany, signed an agreement with Iran. It was called the "Iran nuclear deal." This deal carefully limited Iran's nuclear program. In return, some sanctions were removed.</p>
            <p>This important nuclear deal has now stopped. This is mainly because the U.S. left the deal in 2018, when Donald Trump was president, and started sanctions against Iran again.</p>
            <p>Now, the three countries (France, UK, and Germany) have told the Security Council that Iran has broken the 2015 agreement. They say Iran has not kept its promise to limit nuclear weapons. For example, its amount of enriched uranium is now more than 40 times what the deal allowed. Because of this, they want to change the situation and put sanctions back on Iran.</p>
            <p>People close to the situation say that to keep the current situation (where sanctions are lifted), nine countries would need to vote yes. But it is expected that not enough countries will vote yes. This means sanctions on Iran will likely start again.</p>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview that international sanctions on Iran are expected to start again by the end of this month at the latest. This interview was shown on Israeli TV today.</p>
            <p>Western countries and Israel have often said that Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons. But Iran says this is not true.</p>
