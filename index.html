            <h1>Israeli Prime Minister's UN Speech: Brazil and Other Countries Walk Out</h1>
            <p>Today in New York, during a United Nations meeting, Brazil's group joined many other countries. They all left before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu started his speech. They did this to show they were unhappy about Israel's military actions in Gaza.</p>
            <p>News from CNN Brazil and other sources said that Brazilian government workers explained the walkout was a planned political action. It was meant to show their disapproval of Israel's actions in the Middle East conflict. Besides Brazil, groups from Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Venezuela also left. This left many empty seats in the room.</p>
            <p>The Iranian group even put photos of children who were hurt on their seats to protest Israel's military actions in Gaza. In the audience, some people clapped, and some booed. This showed that countries around the world have different opinions about Israel's policies.</p>
            <p>For a long time, Brazil has tried to stay neutral on issues in the Middle East. But in recent years, the world situation has changed, and so has the feeling within Brazil. Because of this, Brazil has started to show stronger opinions at the UN and other international meetings. This walkout clearly shows what Brazil's foreign affairs department thinks about Israel's policies.</p>
            <p>Brazil's President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has publicly criticized Israel's actions in Gaza. He also supports the United Nations' recognition of Palestine as a country. During the UN meeting, the Brazilian group's walkout was not only a protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's personal views. It was also a rejection of Israel's policies as a whole.</p>
            <p>Brazilian news said that this protest might make Israel more isolated from other countries. The International Criminal Court has already issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. They accuse him of committing crimes against humanity in Gaza. The United Nations also passed a resolution, which is not legally binding, asking Israel to recognize Palestine as a country.</p>
            <p>For Brazil, this action might make them a stronger moral leader among countries in the Global South. But it could also cause problems in their relationships with Israel and countries that support Israel.</p>
            <p>The report said that this protest at the UN meeting was more than just a diplomatic action. It showed how countries around the world are changing their views on the Middle East conflict. Brazil's choice might show how a new, important country tries to balance what is right with what is practical in its foreign policy.</p>

            <h1>Foreign Media: ByteDance Still Keeps Control Over TikTok's US Business and Shares Profits</h1>
            <p>People who know about the situation said that ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, will still own some parts of TikTok's business in the US. However, ByteDance will give control of TikTok's data, content, and algorithms to a new joint company. ByteDance will still receive half of the profits from the US business.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that ByteDance will have a bigger role than expected in how TikTok's US version is run. This shows that the large tech company from China will continue to be very involved in TikTok's operations in the US.</p>
            <p>Some US financial news said that the new joint company will rent a copy of the algorithm from ByteDance. Then, Oracle will retrain this algorithm "from the beginning." All data from US users will be stored in a secure cloud managed by Oracle. ByteDance will not be able to get information about TikTok's US users or control the algorithm in the US.</p>
            <p>People familiar with the matter said that ByteDance can charge a fee for letting the US team use the algorithm copy. They will also get a share of the profits based on how much of the company they own. Overall, after the new owners take over TikTok US, ByteDance will still get 50% or more of the total profits from the US business.</p>
            <p>On September 25, US President Trump signed an official order. He announced that TikTok's US business would be sold to a group of investors, including Oracle and Silver Lake. This was done to meet national security rules.</p>
            <p>The information about who owns what, which is slowly becoming public, might make people in the US Congress and critics question the TikTok deal. They might ask if the deal approved by Trump follows the "sell or ban" law passed in 2024.</p>
            <p>Last April, the US Congress passed a law with strong support from both main political parties. This law was called the "Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act" (also known as "sell or ban"). President Biden signed it in the same month. The law requires ByteDance to sell its US business, or TikTok would be banned.</p>
            <p>People who know about the deal said that TikTok in the US will be split into two separate parts. The joint company that Trump announced will be in charge of US user data and the algorithm. The other part, fully owned by ByteDance, will manage money-making parts like advertising and online shopping.</p>
            <p>Chinese news outlets also reported on this two-part structure on September 26. They said that ByteDance would still control TikTok US's brand, online shopping, and international connections. The new joint company would handle user data and the algorithm. However, news reports from "LatePost" and "Caixin" about this were later removed.</p>
            <p>For Trump, it is very important for TikTok to continue to exist in the US. He often talks about how the platform helped him reach young voters. He partly gives credit to TikTok, which has 170 million users in the US, for his win last year. His personal TikTok account also has 15 million followers, and the White House opened its official TikTok account last month.</p>
            <p>After Reuters shared this information, John Moolenaar, a Republican Congressman and chairman of the House "Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party," said he would closely watch this deal. He stressed that the deal should "remove any working connections between the new company and ByteDance."</p>
            <p>Moolenaar said, "The law has strict rules. It stops ByteDance and any new company taking over TikTok from working together on the very important algorithm."</p>
