            <h1>Ministry of Interior Offers Training to Improve New Associations' Management</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior announced today that by June, there were 25,000 national associations. Among these, 1,170 new associations started in 2024. To help these new groups build their operations and manage them better, the Ministry will hold a free management training camp on September 18th and 19th. People can sign up for it now.</p>
            <p>In a press release today, the Ministry of Interior said that in recent years, more and more people want to join groups and take part in public matters. People's groups are growing fast and are becoming more diverse. This shows that society is active and people want to get involved. By June, there were 25,224 national groups, and 1,170 new ones started in 2024.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior said that to help new national social groups quickly learn about laws and management skills, and to improve their basic operations and governance, a management training camp will be held from September 18th to 19th. People can sign up for free until September 10th on the Ministry of Interior's website, under the "Cooperation and People's Associations" section (https://www.moi.gov.tw/group.htm). The training is for elected officers of national associations formed in 2024. This includes chairpersons, directors, supervisors, secretaries-general, finance managers, or administrative staff. Only one person from each association can attend, and there are 150 spots in total.</p>
            <p>The training will cover topics such as common laws for people's groups, preventing money laundering, cross-strait exchanges, tax and financial management, how to write rules for groups, and how to prevent fraud. For the first time, a course on "Fundraising Laws and Practices" has been added. This will help associations plan how to raise money legally and avoid breaking laws.</p>

            <h1>New Flexible Green Energy Plan Starts Oct. 1, Allows Electricity Retailers to Join</h1>
            <p>TSMC was the first to try a green energy plan called the "sandbox plan." This plan will end in late September. Taipower is now making a better version of this plan. It will start on October 1st. The new plan will let electricity selling companies join in sharing green energy in a flexible way. They will combine different types of power use from various companies. This will help use electricity from power plants at different times and reduce the problem of too much leftover electricity.</p>
            <p>For example, office buildings use most electricity from Monday to Friday. Big restaurants use a lot of electricity on weekends. If we add factories that still produce at night, combining these can help match how much electricity is made with how much is used.</p>
            <p>Taipower started a "pilot project for flexible power transfer" (sandbox plan) in October 2023. The main idea was to "give companies the power to manage green electricity." This let different factories of the same company decide how much green electricity they needed to use, meeting their clean energy goals. TSMC tried it first, and later another big screen manufacturing company joined.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that while the current sandbox plan can increase the amount of electricity matched, it does not show the true supply and demand of electricity or its value at different times. Also, because different parts of one company use electricity in similar ways, if a company needs more clean energy, the electricity made and used at certain times might not match well. This can lead to extra electricity, like for companies closed on weekends that cannot use electricity on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
            <p>Because the sandbox plan will end by September this year, and the Electricity Act has been changed to say that green energy will be traded in a market in the future, Taipower has made improvements. They have now introduced the "Green Electricity Market Flexible Allocation Pilot Project."</p>
            <p>It is known that the biggest difference between the two plans is that the new plan lets electricity selling companies have the right to flexible allocation. By bringing together different company users to combine electricity generation and use, they can use different types of power needs well and flexibly share the electricity generated.</p>
            <p>Also, the old sandbox plan first matched electricity every 15 minutes. Then, it calculated how much extra electricity there was. After that, it allowed a second matching each month during the same time periods (peak, mid-peak, off-peak, and Saturday mid-peak). The new plan will go back to matching electricity data every 15 minutes. This is better for balancing electricity supply and demand and showing the value of electricity at different times. Countries like the US, UK, and Japan have already developed this kind of electricity trading system.</p>
            <p>Also, because one company might not be able to use all the green energy from one power plant, the green energy plant can split its power among different flexible allocation plans. Or it can take part in both regular power transfer and flexible allocation at the same time.</p>
            <p>Taipower said it recently held meetings to explain the plan. Besides the current users of the sandbox plan, some listed electronics companies and large electricity selling companies have shown interest. Those who want to join will need to send a written application to Taipower. After reviewing it, Taipower will give them a "Letter of Agreement to Participate in the Flexible Allocation Plan," and then they can go through further review and sign contracts.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Indigenous Voices Resound in Moscow's Music Halls, Moving Music Reaches Russia</h1>
            <p>Music from Taiwan's Indigenous people filled the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow. The special Jew's harp and warrior dance of the Atayal people, and the multi-part songs of the Amis people, brought the spirit of Austronesian cultures across 55 degrees North latitude. This was the first time such music reached the heart of Russia, and it received great applause.</p>
            <p>On the evening of August 24th (local time), the 19th "Friends Meeting" International Music Festival at the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory held a "Taiwan Night â€“ Indigenous Culture Music Festival." This event took place in the famous Rachmaninoff Concert Hall. It was held to remember the 100th anniversary of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo's visit to Russia. The performing group returned to Taiwan on August 26th.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine is still going on. The group had to go through many checkpoints and security checks. After strict and complex entry procedures, they traveled for a day and finally arrived in faraway Moscow.</p>
            <p>Luo Jing-ru, Taiwan's representative in Russia, spoke to the Central News Agency there. She said this special performance was not only the first time a Taiwanese art group was asked to perform in an important music center in Russia. It also showed a warm cultural light during the pandemic and the shadow of war.</p>
            <p>Yang Meng-che, the main planner of the event and a part-time professor at Taipei Education University, said that performing in a world-famous music hall means Taiwan's cultural soft power has taken a big step forward. He added, "We want the world to hear Taiwan," and hoped to create bigger stages for young musicians.</p>
            <p>The performance began with a traditional blessing ceremony led by Kuo Tzu-hsiung, the founder of the Chu-Yin Culture and Arts Group. After this, Art Director Kao Shu-chuan and others sang Amis "macacadaay polyphony," including songs for meeting places, weeding millet, and a love song from Malan. Their voices echoed like in a valley, sharing the wisdom of tribal life.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Indigenous people have unique history, culture, and traditions. In their villages, there are songs for farming, daily life, and festivals. Yawi Hayung, a young Atayal man from Yilan, used a Jew's harp and old melodies to tell the story of his people's moves. Then, a warrior dance made the whole audience very excited.</p>
            <p>Also, at the event, a young Taiwanese-American man named Rafael Tseng played piano pieces like "Dark Sky," "Four Seasons Red," and "The One I Miss." He played these to honor his late father. The beautiful music made many overseas Taiwanese cry. One Taiwanese person living abroad said to a reporter with a choked voice, "It has been a long time since I heard sounds from Taiwan."</p>
            <p>The performance hall was full. Over 200 people attended, including past representatives to Taiwan, business people, academics, and Russians living in Russia. When the group sang the Russian love folk song "Katyusha," everyone applauded and sang along. The Indigenous dance music then made the audience get up and dance together, creating a very lively and exciting atmosphere.</p>
            <p>"This concert helped us understand Taiwan better and also improved our communication," Sergey Khorolskiy, a businessman who often travels between Taiwan and Russia, told reporters.</p>
            <p>"Taiwan Night" was co-organized by the Conservatory and the Chinese International Exhibition and Economic Exchange Association. The Council of Indigenous Peoples, the Taipei-Moscow Economic and Cultural Coordination Commission, and Legislator Wu Li-hua's office also helped. This event started a new chapter in art and culture exchange.</p>
            <p>Luo Jing-ru said that the passion and power of Taiwan's Indigenous music deeply touched their Russian friends. She added, "This is an exchange that goes beyond language and borders. In the long run, it brings a chance for better relations between Taiwan and Russia."</p>
