            <h1>Ji Liancheng: Landslide Lake Still on Red Alert, Hualien County Government Asked to Complete Local Evacuation Plan</h1>
            <p>Ji Liancheng, a main coordinator from the Central Emergency Operation Center's forward office, said today that there are four things that need to happen to remove the red alert for the landslide dam lake. He also said that the Hualien County Government will be asked today to finish their local evacuation plan. The Ministry of Interior will hold a meeting for the central government part.</p>
            <p>A landslide dam lake in Matai'an Stream in Hualien caused serious damage to Guangfu Township when it overflowed. This morning, Ji Liancheng spoke at a press conference at the forward office. He stated that the landslide dam lake is still on red alert. The water level is currently 6.4% of what it was before the overflow, which is about 5.85 million tons. To remove the red alert, four conditions must be met.</p>
            <p>First, they need to check if the water flow from the landslide dam lake is causing problems. Second, a 2860-meter-long safety dike has been fixed and made 5 meters taller. It now has three layers of protection. The last layer of the earth dike has a steel mesh and cement slurry on top to make it stronger. Third, dredging work has taken out 200,000 to 300,000 cubic meters of material, and they will dig deeper. Lastly, there is an evacuation plan. The county government will be asked to finish their local evacuation plan today. The Ministry of Interior will have a meeting for the central government part.</p>
            <p>Ji Liancheng said that today's work has four main points. These include cleaning all the side ditches in the disaster area, with the goal to finish this by October 18. Also, Fozu Street, from its start to Baoan Temple, has been made a separate area. A military colonel will be fully in charge of rescue work in the area north of Fozu Street. They expect Fozu Street to be completely restored within two days.</p>
            <p>He then said that Fenglin Township is now the 8th disaster relief area. Today, inspectors went to check everything in the area. Starting tomorrow, Fenglin Township will be an important area. Central government and county government teams, volunteers, and military personnel will go to Fenglin Township. A military lieutenant colonel will be in charge of the rescue work there.</p>
            <p>Ji Liancheng also mentioned that building associations will start helping with safety checks today. They will decide if damaged houses are safe to live in. After these safety checks are done, repair work will begin.</p>
            <p>In addition, Ji Liancheng said that Guangfu Junior High, Dajin Elementary, and Guangfu Elementary schools will start classes again tomorrow. They meet all the conditions to reopen. Dajin Elementary is still housing people who lost their homes. The school has agreed to keep the people and students in separate areas so they do not bother each other. Some grades at Dajin Elementary were planned to study at Tabalong Elementary, but today it was confirmed that all grades will study at their original school.</p>
            <p>He said that Guangfu Vocational High School was hit very hard. Even though the teaching areas are ready, they will have online classes tomorrow because of safety concerns. In-person classes will start again on October 13.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang Plans to Run for New Taipei Mayor, White Camp Confirms Looking for Office Space</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City Council member Chen Shih-hsuan from the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) said today that party leader Huang Kuo-chang has often said he wants to be the best choice for New Taipei. Recently, Huang asked Chen to find a good place in New Taipei. This place will be for Huang Kuo-chang's campaign office for mayor.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-hsuan shared in a press release that he was interviewed on the radio today. The host, Huang Yang-ming, asked him about Huang Kuo-chang's plans for the election in New Taipei. Chen said that Huang Kuo-chang is getting ready for the 2026 New Taipei mayoral election as planned.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-hsuan said that besides the TPP's service centers in different parts of New Taipei, which are always working in the local areas, a city policy research team is also being formed. This team will also share ideas about important issues in New Taipei.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-hsuan said that Huang Kuo-chang will open a campaign office for the New Taipei mayor election. He has asked Chen to help find a suitable place for the campaign team to work in the future. This shows that Huang Kuo-chang is serious about running for office.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-hsuan was asked if there are problems with two strong leaders in the TPP now that former leader Ko Wen-je has been released on bail. Chen said that from what he has seen, Ko Wen-je and Huang Kuo-chang work very well together. In the past, people said the TPP was a party with only one strong leader. Now, with Ko Wen-je's experience in leading and Huang Kuo-chang's strong fighting spirit, their combined effort is only good for the TPP.</p>

            <h1>Polanco's Two Home Runs Defeat 'Tiger King,' Mariners Beat Tigers to Tie Division Series</h1>
            <p>Seattle, October 5 (CNA) â€“ Game 2 of the MLB American League Division Series took place in Seattle today. The home team, the Mariners, lost by only one run yesterday, but they did not want to fall too far behind. Jorge Polanco hit two solo home runs in the 4th and 6th innings, which helped the Mariners win. In the end, they beat the Detroit Tigers 3-2. This made the best-of-five series tied.</p>
            <p>For this game, the Tigers started Tarik Skubal, who pitched very well in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series against Cleveland. The Mariners had Luis Castillo as their starting pitcher. Both teams continued their exciting game from yesterday. In the first three innings, both teams had players on base, but neither could score any runs.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 4th inning, Jorge Polanco hit a solo home run, giving the Mariners the first score. In the top of the 5th inning, the Tigers started to attack. They got players on first and third base because of a walk and a hit. The Mariners quickly took Luis Castillo out and put in Gabe Speier. Speier did well. He struck out Kerry Carpenter, which stopped the Tigers from scoring more. After 5 innings, the Mariners were ahead 1-0.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 6th inning, Polanco hit another home run. This made the Mariners' lead bigger, 2-0. The Tigers' offense was still quiet. After 7 innings, they only got 2 hits off the Mariners' three pitchers.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 8th inning, the Mariners changed pitchers, and the Tigers finally had a chance. Gleyber Torres got a walk. Riley Green got to first base because of a fielder's choice. Then, with one out and players on first and second base, Spencer Torkelson hit a double. This cleared the bases, and the Tigers tied the game 2-2.</p>
            <p>However, the Mariners, who lost closely yesterday, did not want to fall behind in the series. Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodriguez, who both had three hits yesterday, became heroes. In the bottom of the 8th inning, Raleigh hit a double with one out. Then, J-Rod immediately hit another double right after him, letting Raleigh score the important third run.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 9th inning, the closer, AndrÃ©s MuÃ±oz, came in and successfully held on to the win. In the end, the Mariners won by just one run.</p>
            <p>After the game, J-Rod was asked where hitting the winning shot ranked in his career. He answered, "It's definitely number one. We haven't had a moment like this in a long time, so for the whole team to win together tonight means a lot to me. Seeing the fans' reaction and the atmosphere was truly unforgettable. I will always keep this memory in my heart."</p>
            <p>Game 3 of the MLB American League Division Series will move to the Tigers' home field on October 7. The Mariners plan to start Logan Gilbert, and the Tigers will have right-handed pitcher Jack Flaherty.</p>
