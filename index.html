            <h1>Mexican President: US delays higher taxes, keeps North American Agreement</h1>
            <p>The President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said today that U.S. President Trump decided to delay higher taxes on Mexican products. She said this helps to keep the current North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Sheinbaum spoke with Trump. Later, at a morning press conference, she said that Mexico's government has made the best possible deal compared to other countries also facing new U.S. import taxes.</p>
            <p>She also said that both governments are close to making a safety agreement. This agreement will help stop illegal drug sales across the border and prevent guns from being brought into Mexico from the U.S.</p>
            <p>Trump said Mexico was not doing enough to stop drugs. He wrote on his social media, "Truth Social," that he has "agreed to extend our exact same agreement from a little while ago for 90 days."</p>
            <p>Mexican goods that are not part of the USMCA trade agreement currently have a 25% U.S. tax.</p>
            <p>During his first time as president, Trump successfully pushed to change the old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to the USMCA trade agreement starting in July 2020. The three countries plan to check the USMCA agreement again next July.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum agreed with Trump's praise for the USMCA trade agreement. She called it "one of the best trade deals ever" and "the only way we can compete with Asian countries, especially China."</p>
            <p>In 2023, Mexico became the biggest trading partner for the U.S., taking China's place. More than 80% of Mexico's exports go to the U.S.</p>

            <h1>Trump's Special Envoy to Visit Gaza, See Residents, Check Aid Distribution</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 31st (CNA) â€“ Steve Witkoff, who is President Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, will visit the Gaza Strip tomorrow. He will check how aid is given out and meet with people in Gaza who are suffering from the war. The U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, will go with him.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: "Special Envoy Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee will go to Gaza tomorrow. They will look at where aid is currently given out. They will also make sure there is a plan to give more food. They will meet with local people in Gaza to hear directly about the difficult situation there."</p>
            <p>Reuters says that groups that watch global hunger have warned that there is a famine in Gaza. Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today. He tried to save the ceasefire talks for Gaza and deal with the humanitarian crisis there.</p>
            <p>Soon after Witkoff arrived in Israel, Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social": "The fastest way to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is for Hamas to give up and release the hostages!"</p>

            <h1>China Questions H20 Chip Security Risks, Nvidia Denies 'Backdoors'</h1>
            <p>Beijing/San Francisco, July 31st (CNA) â€“ China recently showed concern about possible security risks in the H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chips made by the big chip company Nvidia. Today, Nvidia said that its products do not have "backdoors" that can be used to access or control them from far away.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which looks after internet matters in China, said they are worried. This is because the U.S. suggested that advanced chips sent to other countries should have features that allow them to be tracked and located. The U.S. had just allowed Nvidia to start selling H20 chips to China again. But today, the CAC spoke with Nvidia and asked them to explain the risks. This has made it unclear if Nvidia can send chips to China.</p>
            <p>The CAC said that they asked Nvidia to explain if the H20 chips have any "backdoor" security risks. They are worried about users' data and privacy being harmed inside China.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Nvidia said in a statement: "Online safety is very important to us. Nvidia chips do not have any 'backdoors' that let anyone access or control them from far away."</p>
            <p>The White House and both parts of the U.S. Congress have suggested that American chip companies should put location-checking technology into chips. This is to stop chips from being sent to countries where U.S. laws say they cannot be exported. These ideas from Congress and the White House are not yet official rules, and there are no detailed technical requirements yet.</p>
            <p>Nvidia has been important in the relationship between the U.S. and China. In April this year, the U.S. stopped Nvidia from selling H20 chips to China, but they allowed it again in July. In late 2023, the U.S. put limits on selling advanced AI chips. Because of this, Nvidia developed the H20 chip especially for the Chinese market.</p>
