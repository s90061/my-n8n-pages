            <h1>Civil Groups Hold Civil Defense Forum; Scholars Suggest 4 Situations Need Prior Thought, Including Command and Information</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 27 (CNA) The Formosa Republic Society held a civil defense forum today. More than 20 civil defense, disaster prevention, and self-training groups from all over Taiwan took part. Regarding how the civil defense system works during a war, scholar Chang Yu-min pointed out that people need to think beforehand about four situations: the command system, how to share resources, how to help in disaster areas, and how to share information. This way, people can protect themselves and help each other.</p>
            <p>The "2025 Formosa Republic Society Civil Defense Forum," organized by the Formosa Republic Society and helped by the Taiwan Liberty Society, took place in Taipei today. Members from more than 20 civil defense, disaster prevention, and self-training groups from around Taiwan joined in person and online. Foreign think tanks also joined online. The forum invited Liu Yu-hsi and Liu Wen, members of the Presidential Office's All-Society Defense Resilience Committee, Assistant Professor Chang Yu-min from the Central Police University, and retired Major General Yu Tsung-chi to speak.</p>
            <p>Ma Shih-yuan, the Political Deputy Minister of the Interior, could not come because he was helping with disaster relief. In his written speech, he said that when disasters happen, they test not only how well we react but also how well we prepare. For example, after the Mata'an Weir Lake event, how shelters are run, how supplies are given out, and how medical resources are moved all test if our preparations are good enough.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-hsi said that war mobilization and all-society defense resilience are "very similar but not exactly the same." War mobilization is a duty to help the military, while all-society defense resilience is about volunteering, helping oneself and others, and keeping society working. So, it asks people to actively protect themselves and their homes, and more people will want to help.</p>
            <p>Chang Yu-min explained that before an armed conflict, it starts with information warfare and psychological warfare. Then, there will be blockades, missile attacks, and long-range rocket attacks. Long-range rockets are not as accurate as missiles, are hard to detect and defend against, and cause a lot of damage. Therefore, in wartime, for civil defense to help people protect themselves, four things need to be considered: the command system, how to share resources, how to help in disaster areas, and how to share information.</p>
            <p>Regarding these four situations that need thought, Chang Yu-min stressed that if local leaders cannot do their job, the public needs a "self-starting command system" instead of just waiting for the existing system. Also, during natural disasters or war, the damage in different places will be different. Resources need to be moved between cities and counties, going beyond exercises that only focus on one event or one area. For disaster relief, when there is fighting, relief teams must make a plan to keep themselves safe. Also, military, police, firefighters, and civil groups cannot talk to each other using their radios, so they need to think about how all the teams can communicate. The most important thing is to practice this often.</p>
            <p>Yang Shun-lin, the head of the Taiwan Civil Group Association, gave advice to local civil defense training groups. He said they should keep training themselves, including learning to tell friends from enemies and reporting enemy situations to the command system. Second, they should learn "gray man camouflage skills" to keep themselves safe. Third, they should set up and practice communication channels within and between groups. He also hopes the government will do more to promote national defense and military science, using ways similar to how the Ministry of Culture promotes events, to help everyone understand war better and be more ready to resist.</p>
            <p>Wu Cheng-tsung, who helps connect civil defense groups in the Formosa Republic Society Youth Department, said that like the current situation in Hualien Guangfu, many volunteers arrived but did not know what to do. The forum's goal is to help local civil defense groups and training groups understand how to create their own systems and command chains to keep things working when society is out of order due to natural disasters or war.

            <h1>Baseball Asian Championship: South Korea Shuts Out Japan; Taiwan and Japan Will Play for the Championship</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 27 (CNA) On the second day of the Baseball Asian Championship playoffs, Taiwan beat China today. In the evening, South Korea shut out Japan in their big game. This means Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea all had 2 wins and 1 loss in the playoffs. But after looking at the "team quality balance" (TQB) scores, Taiwan and Japan will play each other in tomorrow's championship game.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan team won all 3 games in the first round, so they moved to the playoffs with 1 win already. Yesterday, in their first playoff game, Taiwan lost to Japan 2-3. But in the afternoon game today, Taiwan beat China 4-0, which put them in a good position to move forward.</p>
            <p>In the evening, there was a big game between Japan and South Korea. South Korea's starting pitcher, Hong Min-kyu, threw 98 pitches over 6.2 innings. He only allowed 3 hits and gave up 3 walks, striking out 2 batters. He completely stopped the Japanese team from scoring. Then, Yang Jae-hoon pitched for 2.1 innings and did not allow any runs either. Together, they shut out Japan.</p>
            <p>In the first inning, South Korea scored their only run when Ryu Hyun-jun hit a double that brought in one run. In the end, South Korea beat Japan 1-0.</p>
            <p>Because Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea all had 2 wins and 1 loss in the playoffs, their records were tied. After comparing their "team quality balance" (TQB) scores, it was decided that Taiwan and Japan would play in the championship game. The two teams will meet again.</p>
            <p>The championship game will start tomorrow at 6:30 PM. The Taiwan team will be the home team, and Japan will be the away team. The game for third place will be between China and South Korea. (Edited by Wu Su-jou) 20250927</p>

            <h1>TPVL Lianzhuang Wins First Historic Victory with a Straight-Sets Win; Wu Zongxuan Excited to Score the First Point</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 27 (CNA) In the opening game of the Taiwan Professional Volleyball League (TPVL), Taichung Lianzhuang beat Taipei East 25-17, 25-18, 25-20 today. They won with a straight-sets victory. Wu Zongxuan, who is called the "golden left hand" and scored the first historic point, said he was very excited to make history.</p>
            <p>The TPVL, Taiwan's first professional volleyball league, started its first year's opening game today at Taipei East's home court after almost a year of preparation. However, the visiting Taichung Lianzhuang team was better. Their foreign player Voeurn Veasna scored 19 points, the most in the game. Another foreign player, Khangal Tamiraa, scored 16 points, and Wu Zongxuan added 12 points. They won with a straight-sets victory, getting the TPVL's first historic win.</p>
            <p>After the game, Wu Zongxuan, who scored the TPVL's first historic point, told the media that he was very excited to make this record. He even said his teammates had never seen him shout like that before. He also mentioned that the team had prepared for this game for a long time. From the beginning, they showed good teamwork and energy, and they played better and better in the second and third sets. He also said, "We are very thankful to our opponents for giving us a good challenge. We saw our team's weaknesses, and we will adjust them well later."</p>
            <p>Wu Zongxuan shared that he worked a lot on his body shape during the break between seasons. He joked that he was a bit nervous at the start of today's game and could only shout to calm himself down. He said, "I thought the home fans would be meaner, but maybe it's the first game and they are still getting used to it. But after this first game, I believe they will know how to deal with the away team."</p>
            <p>Gao Wei-cheng, the captain of the East team, said he was very touched to see so many fans supporting Taiwanese volleyball. As players, they must play well and try to win games to make the home fans happy with a victory. He added, "It was my first time in such a big event. Later, when I walked around the court and waved to the fans, I realized there were so many people. I experienced many things I had never experienced before." (Edited by Chang Ming-kun) 20250927</p>
