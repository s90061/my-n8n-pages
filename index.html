            <h1>Namaxia Road Cut Off, Premier Cho Calls Mayor Chen, Central Government Offers Full Help</h1>
            <p>Recently, heavy rain has fallen non-stop in southern Taiwan. In Kaohsiung's Namaxia District, many roads that connect to other areas are blocked by landslides. People can only carry supplies on foot. A person from the government said that Premier Cho Jung-tai was worried that the rain would still be heavy these two days. He wanted to visit the area himself, but he was afraid it would get in the way of rescue work, so he waited. Instead, he called Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai to check the situation. He found out that all 300-plus families in Namaxia are safe at home and they have enough supplies.</p>
            <p>The heavy rain in the south has not stopped. The Central Weather Administration today continued to warn about heavy rain. From early tomorrow morning until noon, there will be more heavy rain in areas south of Taichung. The days of heavy rain have caused floods and mudslides. In Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and nine townships in Pingtung County like Sandimen, schools and offices will be closed on August 3rd. The Central Emergency Operation Center started a top-level alert at 9 PM tonight.</p>
            <p>Many roads connecting to Kaohsiung's Namaxia District are blocked because of landslides, so supplies are temporarily carried on foot. A government official said that Premier Cho Jung-tai was worried about the non-stop rain in the south. He listened to reports and also called Mayor Chen Chi-mai right away. He wanted to visit the disaster area himself to see the situation. But because the rain was still strong and the mountains were soft with mud, he decided not to go to the front lines for these two days so as not to get in the way of rescue. Premier Cho has told the different government parts to help a lot. Mayor Chen Chi-mai thanked Premier Cho for his concern for the area.</p>
            <p>The government official said that after checking with Kaohsiung, the roads to Namaxia are blocked, but all 300-plus families in the Namaxia mountain area are safe. Also, there is no problem with not having enough supplies. People who live in Kaohsiung said that besides food, some local people had asked for baby formula earlier, and it was supplied this afternoon.</p>
            <p>Because of the continuing heavy rain in southern Taiwan, a government official said that Premier Cho Jung-tai has not planned to visit the disaster area today or tomorrow to avoid getting in the way of rescue work. But tomorrow at 9 AM, he will go to the Central Emergency Operation Center. He plans to talk by video with local governments in Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County. He wants to learn about the damage from the heavy rain on July 28th that came from the southwest wind.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also put a message on Facebook tonight. He reminded people that the Weather Administration predicts there might be short but strong rain tomorrow. This includes heavy rain in areas south of Taichung, and very heavy rain in the mountains of Kaohsiung and Pingtung. There might also be local heavy rain in northern and southeastern areas in the afternoon. He told people not to go to the mountains if they don't need to these few days. The government, both central and local, will continue to do their best to prevent and help with disasters and get through this difficult time with the people. (Editor: Lin Ke-lun) August 2, 2025</p>

            <h1>South African Official: Taiwan's Chip Rules Will Hurt South Africa's Economy Twice</h1>
            <p>To react to the South African government breaking an agreement by itself and changing the status and names of Taiwan's two offices there, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said recently it might stop sending chips to South Africa. Ryan Smith, a spokesperson for South Africa's Democratic Alliance party, said that with the uncertain import taxes from the United States, Taiwan's possible chip limits will hit South Africa's economy twice.</p>
            <p>Since October of last year, the South African government has sent letters twice asking Taiwan's offices to move out of the capital, Pretoria. While they were talking, South Africa's Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) website changed the name of Taiwan's office to "Taipei Commercial Office" and put it under "International Organizations." They also changed its address to Johannesburg. Then, on July 21st this year, South Africa made another public announcement, changing the names of both offices to "Taipei Commercial Office in Johannesburg" and "Taipei Commercial Office in Cape Town."</p>
            <p>Because of what South Africa's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did, Taiwan's office in Pretoria, which was like an embassy, and the office in Cape Town will completely lose their ability to do diplomatic work like giving out passports, visas, and checking documents.</p>
            <p>Ryan Smith, who is a lawmaker and spokesperson for international relations for South Africa's second-largest ruling party, the Democratic Alliance, wrote an article on the party's website. He said that South Africa is now in a difficult time negotiating trade agreements with the United States. But Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola did what he wanted without needing to, lowering the status and changing the names of Taiwan's offices and asking them to move from the capital. This means South Africa now also has to face a second hit from possible limits on Taiwanese semiconductor chips coming in.</p>
            <p>Smith said that these limits could put many thousands of jobs in South Africa at risk. South Africa's car industry needs Taiwanese chips. Every year, it sells about 300 billion Rand (South African money, about 495 billion New Taiwan Dollars) of car products around the world. This creates many thousands of jobs in South Africa.</p>
            <p>Smith strongly criticized this. He said that right now, the most important thing for the South African government is to make a strong plan for talking about money with other countries. This is to make the economy, which is not growing, better again and to deal with more people without jobs. However, the African National Congress (ANC), which leads the national unity government (GNU), has refused to follow a true "non-aligned foreign policy" as they promised. They are doing this to help their own party.</p>
            <p>Smith explained more. He said that asking Taiwan's offices to move at this time is not a foreign policy that cares about the country's well-being. Instead, it is a foreign policy that gave in to their party's political goals to get what they want, and it will really hurt the country's economy.</p>
            <p>Smith stressed that in the future, South Africa's economic growth needs semiconductor chips. So, South Africa cannot have a foreign policy that forces it to act in a way that excludes trade partners.</p>
            <p>Smith asked the South African government to talk with the Taiwanese government quickly to make sure they can get this very important technology that cannot be replaced.</p>
            <p>The Democratic Alliance, which is very friendly to Taiwan, became the second-largest ruling partner in South Africa's first ever coalition government, the "National Unity Government" (GNU), after the elections in July last year. They now have 12 seats in 32 government departments.</p>
            <p>Ivan Meyer, the federal chairperson of the Democratic Alliance, was punished by China in February this year because he visited Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Also, Lee Tsung-wei, a lawmaker in South Africa who is from Taiwan and is also part of the Democratic Alliance, told the Central News Agency that South Africa sends a lot of precious metals to Taiwan every year. So, they could also think about raising the import tax on South African precious metals as a way to react.</p>
            <p>Lee Tsung-wei also said that the United States is South Africa's second biggest market for exports, after China. The US now has a 30% tax on South African goods, which hurts a lot. Also, China's economy is not doing well right now, so it will import less. Because of this, sending precious metals to Taiwan is quite important for South Africa.</p>
            <p>The economic team of Taiwan's office in South Africa said that in 2024, South Africa sent precious metals to Taiwan worth 1.25 billion US dollars (about 37.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars). The import tax was 5%.</p>
            <p>Lee Tsung-wei said that Taiwan can get the precious metals it needs from the United States, Canada, India, or Australia. Also, the New Taiwan Dollar is stronger against the US Dollar now, so if Taiwan buys from the US instead, it could help reduce the trade difference between Taiwan and the US.

            <h1>U12 World Cup: Taiwan Wins Closely Against South Korea, Coach Says: Doing Our Best Was a Good Game</h1>
            <p>The U12 World Cup baseball game in Tainan, Taiwan, today was a long fight against South Korea. It lasted four and a half hours and went to the ninth extra inning. Taiwan finally won 11 to 5. Tomorrow, Taiwan will play South Korea again for third place. Head coach Chang Tzu-chien said that everyone in this game worked very hard and did not give up. He added, "Trying your best makes it a good game."</p>
            <p>The last game of the U12 World Cup Super Round playoffs was between Taiwan and South Korea. The game stopped for a bit because of rain. Both teams fought hard until the ninth extra inning. In the top of the ninth inning, Taiwan's batters hit very well and scored 7 runs quickly. South Korea only scored 1 run in the bottom of the ninth. Taiwan won the game.</p>
            <p>After the game, Taiwan's head coach Chang Tzu-chien said that everyone worked hard. When the game stopped because of rain, he kept encouraging his players and telling them to stay focused and not lose concentration. He was also sure that they could win this game.</p>
            <p>Coach Chang said that in this game, everyone tried their best no matter what. They did not give up and kept trying until the end. There were hard times during the game, but the team worked together and became a strong group. Winning was truly moving.</p>
            <p>Because the United States won against Japan in another game, Taiwan could not play in the championship game. The result of the game between Taiwan and South Korea decided their next opponent. Taiwan won, so Japan and the United States will play in the championship game, and Taiwan will play South Korea again for third place.</p>
            <p>Coach Chang said that when they first joined the competition, they hoped to play in the championship game. Even though the result was not what they wanted, everyone tried their best during the game. He said, "As long as you try your best, it's a good game."</p>
            <p>Today's game finished around 10:45 PM. But because they are worried about rain, tomorrow's championship game and third-place game will start at 10 AM at two different places at the same time. Coach Chang said that winning today helped their team spirit a lot. Because of the game schedule, he will pay close attention to how tired the players are. He hopes they can play a good game.
