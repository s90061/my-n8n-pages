            <h1>Russian General Says Army is Attacking Ukraine Constantly</h1>
            <p>The head of the Russian army, Valery Gerasimov, said today that Russian forces are always attacking along almost the entire front line in Ukraine. He also said they have "strategic control" of the war.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Gerasimov spoke to his helpers in a speech released by the Russian Ministry of Defense. He said, "Our combined forces are constantly attacking along almost the whole front line. The Russian army now has full strategic control."</p>
            <p>Gerasimov mentioned that in spring and summer this year, Russia launched 76 accurate attacks on Ukraine's military factories. These attacks aimed to destroy places where long-range missiles and drones are made.</p>
            <p>Gerasimov stated that Russia now controls 99.7% of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. They also control 79% of Donetsk, 74% of Zaporizhzhia, and 76% of Kherson.</p>
            <p>He also claimed that since March this year, Russia has taken over more than 3,500 square kilometers of Ukrainian land and controls 149 villages.</p>
            <p>Open-source maps show that this month, Russian forces started moving closer to Dnipropetrovsk in southeastern Ukraine. According to Gerasimov, Russia has taken control of 7 villages there.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Ukrainian officials said today that Russia carried out a large air attack on southern Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Ivan Fedorov, the governor of Zaporizhzhia, reported that Russian air attacks continued until early morning today. An attack hit a five-story apartment building, killing at least one person and injuring 28 others, including children.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 537 drones and fake drones, and 45 missiles. Ukrainian forces shot down or stopped 510 drones and fake drones, and 38 missiles.</p>
            <p>On August 28, Russia launched a big air attack on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. That attack killed at least 23 people and injured 38.</p>

            <h1>Modi Talks with Zelenskyy, Says India Supports Peace</h1>
            <p>The office of India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, announced today that Modi spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. During their call, Modi again said he supports finding a peaceful way to solve the problems in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelenskyy said in a video speech last night that Modi supports Ukraine's request for a ceasefire in the war with Russia. Zelenskyy hopes this idea will be taken seriously at the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in China.</p>
            <p>Modi's office released a statement saying that Zelenskyy agreed with Modi's ideas about the current situation in Ukraine. Modi also stressed that India supports efforts to bring peace back as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>Modi's office added, "The two leaders also looked at how well India and Ukraine are working together. They talked about how to make their cooperation stronger in all areas that are important to both countries."</p>
            <p>Modi will go to the SCO Tianjin Summit, which starts tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said, "I just spoke with Indian Prime Minister Modi. We talked about what is happening right now. Russia is still fighting this war and still killing people."</p>
            <p>"It is very important that the Indian Prime Minister supports the idea of a ceasefire. A ceasefire would clearly show that Russia is ready to try to find a diplomatic solution. We hope this idea will be considered at the meeting in China."</p>

            <h1>Protests Grow in Indonesia; President Prabowo Cancels China Visit</h1>
            <p>Protests in Indonesia have been going on for several days and have now spread outside the capital, Jakarta. Some local government buildings were even set on fire. Because of this, Indonesia's President Prabowo today canceled his planned trip to China.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Prabowo Subianto was supposed to go to Beijing on September 3rd for a military parade. This parade was to celebrate China's 80th anniversary of winning the war.</p>
            <p>People in Indonesia are angry about the high salaries of members of parliament. This week, many protests started in Jakarta. Yesterday, the protests got worse after a police armored vehicle hit and killed a motorbike taxi driver. This is the first big challenge for President Prabowo's government, which has been in power for almost one year.</p>
            <p>President's spokesperson, Prasetyo Hadi, said in a video statement today, "The President wants to keep watching the situation in Indonesia directly... and find the best solutions."</p>
            <p>"So, the President apologizes to the Chinese government for not being able to attend the big event."</p>
            <p>Prasetyo Hadi also said that another reason Prabowo canceled his trip to China is the United Nations General Assembly, which will happen in September.</p>
            <p>Because of the protests, TikTok, a short video app from the Chinese company ByteDance, announced today that it will stop its live streaming service in Indonesia for the next few days.</p>
            <p>This week, officials in Jakarta called representatives from social media companies like Meta Platforms and TikTok. They asked them to check content more carefully because bad fake news (disinformation) is spreading online. The Indonesian government said that this fake news caused the anti-government protests.</p>
