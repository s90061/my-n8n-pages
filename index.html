Cathay United Bank's private banking chief, Fu Po-sheng, announced on July 14 that the bank plans to launch a private equity fund focusing on Taiwan's technology industry. This comes as the bank starts new operations in Kaohsiung's special financial zone, offering 21 trial services.

Fu noted that private equity markets are becoming more accessible to wealthy clients. The new Kaohsiung zone makes it easier for banks to sell private equity products, making fundraising quicker. Cathay United Asset Management will offer this new fund through the bank's private banking channels.

Regarding investment trends among rich Taiwanese clients, Fu said they often prefer bonds over stocks because bonds offer steady income. They also invest about 10-15% in alternative investments like private equity. Overall, their investment approach is steady and careful. The bank will also introduce a new service called "asset portfolio collateralized loans," which allows clients to use their entire investment portfolio as collateral for loans.

**EU Seeks Fair Competition with China in Green Energy**

Teresa Ribera, the European Union's Vice President for clean energy, stated on July 14 that the EU wants "fair competition" with China in the green energy sector. She explained that the EU does not want a harmful competition based on low wages or poor environmental standards. This statement was made during her visit to Beijing, ahead of a high-level meeting between the EU and China.

The EU is worried that China's large government support leads to too much production, which could cause a big trade imbalance. They fear that cheap Chinese goods entering Europe could hurt European businesses. Ribera denied China's claims that the EU is being "protectionist."

Last October, the EU placed special taxes of up to 35% on electric cars from China and started an investigation into Chinese solar panel makers. When asked if the EU's actions might harm the global move to renewable energy, Ribera agreed it might help in the short term. However, she warned that it could stop long-term investments in the EU's future.

**Indian Foreign Minister Visits China, Asks to Avoid Trade Limits**

India's Foreign Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing on July 14. Jaishankar told Wang that to make relations between India and China normal again, both countries must solve border issues, remove troops, and avoid "limiting trade actions."

This visit is Jaishankar's first to China since a deadly border conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers in mid-2020. That conflict led to a four-year military standoff and damaged relations. However, relations started to get better last October when both countries agreed for their armies to move back.

Jaishankar said that because the border problems have been dealt with, the two countries have made "good progress" in making their relationship normal over the last nine months. He added that it is now their job to handle other border-related issues, like reducing tensions. He also stressed the importance of avoiding trade restrictions and barriers to help both countries cooperate.
