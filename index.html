            <h1>Wei-Chieh Huang pitched only one inning in his first start in CPBL; Dragons lost to Monkeys 4-7</h1>
            <p>Wei-Chieh Huang, a pitcher chosen by the Wei Chuan Dragons in the first round of this year's mid-season draft, started his first game in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) today against the Rakuten Monkeys. He only pitched for one inning and gave up 5 runs. In the end, the Dragons lost to the Monkeys with a score of 4 to 7.</p>
            <p>Wei-Chieh Huang has experience in Major League Baseball (MLB) but has had many injuries in recent years. However, the Dragons still picked him in the first round of the CPBL draft. After playing three games in the minor league to get ready, he was quickly moved to the first team to help as a relief pitcher. Today, he was given the important job of starting against the Monkeys. But Huang did not play well. Also, his teammates made mistakes. He only pitched for one inning and gave up 5 runs, which caused the Dragons to lose.</p>
            <p>In the first inning, Huang got three outs without letting anyone on base. But in the second inning, he had problems. Lin Hung-Yu hit a single, then a teammate made a big error. After that, four more hits followed quickly. He also walked Chen Chen-Wei. Huang had to leave the game without getting any outs. The next pitcher, Kuo Yu-Cheng, could not stop the Monkeys from scoring, and they got 5 runs in that one inning.</p>
            <p>In total, Huang pitched 1 inning and threw 29 pitches. He faced 9 batters, gave up 4 hits, and walked 1 batter. He lost 5 runs, but 2 of them were not his fault.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 5th inning, the Dragons' defense had problems again. The right fielder, Tseng Sheng-An, made a mistake when he tried to catch Chen Chen-Wei's ground ball. His throw back to the infield was also bad. This allowed Chen Chen-Wei to run all the way home. The Dragons scored 3 runs in the top of the 7th inning to try and get closer in score. However, they could not score against Chen Kuan-Yu and Chu Cheng-Yang. So, the Dragons lost 4 to 7. Wei-Chieh Huang got his first loss as a starter in his CPBL career.</p>

            <h1>US Retail Sales Grew More Than Expected in August; No Impact from Trump's Tariffs Yet</h1>
            <p>The US Commerce Department announced today that retail sales in August went up by 0.6% compared to July. This is the same increase as in July. Compared to August last year, sales grew by 5.0%. Both numbers were better than what experts thought they would be. This shows that the tariffs (extra taxes on imported goods) from former President Trump have not yet widely affected the US economy.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), consumer spending is a big reason why the US economy grows. Many businesses in the US have said they feel pressure on prices because President Donald Trump raised tariffs. As these extra costs are passed on to customers, people are watching to see how American shoppers will react.</p>
            <p>For example, in August, sales at car and parts dealers in the US went up by 0.5% compared to July. Sales at restaurants and bars grew by 0.7%, and sales at fresh food stores also went up a little by 0.3%.</p>
            <p>However, in August, sales at US furniture stores went down by 0.3% compared to July. Department store sales also dropped slightly by 0.1%. The drop in earnings for large department stores was very clear. This means that people might be spending less money on certain types of products.</p>
            <p>For some time, importers and retailers in the US have taken on some of the extra tariff costs themselves. But it is not clear how long they can keep doing this. Also, many businesses bought more goods than usual before Trump's new tariffs started. As they use up these goods, they will have to pay higher prices when they buy more.</p>

            <h1>First "French Sports Festival" Starts with Joy and Budget Concerns</h1>
            <p>On September 14, France held its first Sports Festival. Nearly 5,000 events happened across the country at the same time. A main road next to the Louvre Museum in Paris was changed into a "Sports Boulevard." Even though it was rainy, many people came to try Olympic sports like climbing, running, and bobsledding on the street. However, the French government's choice to keep cutting money for sports has recently become a main topic for media discussions.</p>
            <p>President Emmanuel Macron announced the "French Sports Festival" (FÃªte du Sport) when the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics ended. The main goal is to keep the excitement for sports going and show how important sports are to society. From now on, September 14 will be the Sports Festival every year, and this year was the first one.</p>
            <p>On September 14, Rue de Rivoli, a busy street in the heart of Paris's transport and tourism, became the "Sports Boulevard." This street usually has many cars, but it turned into a symbol of the event. From 11 AM to 6 PM that day, cars were sent to different routes, some subway exits were closed, and security checks were set up. The street became a 2-kilometer-long outdoor sports area.</p>
            <p>The activities included common sports like running, tug-of-war, boxing, judo, taekwondo, and skateboarding. It also had Olympic and Paralympic sports that the festival wanted to promote, such as Flag Football, Boccia, and Wheelchair Handball.</p>
            <p>All activities were set up like a fair and were free. Athletes were there to teach people, and many famous athletes also came to meet and talk with the public.</p>
            <p>Lucie and AmÃ©lie, two people from Paris, told the Central News Agency, "We never thought we would try climbing on Rue de Rivoli, especially next to the Louvre Museum." They thought it was good that the festival showed many Paralympic sports that people don't usually see. But they felt there wasn't enough advertising, so not many people knew about it.</p>
            <p>Another person, Sophie, brought her two children to try bobsledding, a Winter Olympic sport. Her son, Henri, said he had seen the sport on TV during the Tokyo Winter Olympics. After trying it today, he found that the bobsled itself was very heavy, but he imagined it would be very fast when sliding on ice.</p>
            <p>Sophie said she believes sports help children develop their minds and have a positive attitude. Her son learned the names of countries and math from watching the sports channel "L'Ã©quipe" since he was young. Now, their whole family watches games together. Her daughter, Jeanne, even started learning to swim after the Paris Olympics last year.</p>
            <p>Sophie, who is a journalist, congratulated Taiwan on its new Ministry of Sport. She stressed that sports can bring peace and bring a country together. It allows international competition to happen with rules, and athletes and viewers can see victories and feel the spirit of sports.</p>
            <p>Even though it rained on September 14, the people who came were still excited. Looking around, men, women, and children of all ages were doing sports together on the wide road surrounded by old buildings. This created a rare sight in Paris. On September 15, the French Ministry of Sport announced that 140,000 people took part in the Paris events that day and said they would hold it again next year.</p>
            <p>However, in contrast to the lively atmosphere, French media questioned the government. Many people also said online that the Sports Festival seemed fake and sad. They felt it did not match the government's policy of cutting sports budgets in recent years.</p>
            <p>According to Le Monde newspaper, the French government has already cut the sports budget by 13% for 2025. It plans to cut it by another 17.6% in 2026.</p>
            <p>StÃ©phane Troussel, the head of Seine-Saint-Denis, an area north of Paris, protested the festival before it began. His local government was one of those that did not take part in the event. This area was important for the 2024 Paris Olympics, with the Stade de France, swimming pools, and the Athletes' Village located there.</p>
            <p>Troussel pointed out that the country is reducing sports resources for young people. For example, the "Pass'Sport" program used to cover children and teenagers aged 6 to 18. But now, children aged 6 to 14 are no longer included.</p>
            <p>According to LibÃ©ration newspaper, AmÃ©lie OudÃ©a-CastÃ©ra, the former Minister of Sports and the Olympics, even said directly, "We are not in the mood to celebrate." She also questioned the government's use of funds from the Paris Olympics to support the Sports Festival.</p>
            <p>Marie Barsacq, the current Minister of Sport, said in the report that creating a Sports Festival helps sports have a place in the current situation. She said, "Supporting sports does not only come from the Ministry of Sport's budget." This statement caused a lot of discussion in the sports world because the budget has been cut for many years.</p>
            <p>The first Sports Festival events will continue until September 21. Around 5,000 events are happening in mainland France and its overseas territories. Local governments and 46 sports associations are organizing them together. The goal is for sports to help make France more "united," "innovative," and "confident."</p>
