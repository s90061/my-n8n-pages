            <h1>Man Drives Drunk, Hits Bank Door, and Runs Away; Police Quickly Catch Him</h1>
            <p>A loud noise was heard at a bank on Wenxin Road Section 1 in Nantun District, Taichung City, around 2 AM today. People saw a car hit the glass door of the bank and then drive away. The police were told about it. They checked cameras on the street and found the driver, a man named Zhu, who was drunk. They caught him around 7 AM.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Precinct of the Taichung City Police Department said that the car went straight into the right glass door of the bank. The glass broke, and a scooter parked nearby was also hit. Luckily, no one was hurt. The car then left immediately.</p>
            <p>When the Dadun Police Station of the Fourth Precinct received the report, officers quickly went to the scene. They used information from people who saw it and the car's license plate left behind. They checked more street cameras and quickly found out who the suspect was.</p>
            <p>Police found that Mr. Zhu drove after drinking at a restaurant. He might have blacked out from drinking. His car drove straight into the bank. When he hit the bank, he woke up, but he didn't know what to do, so he just drove away.</p>
            <p>The police said they tested the driver's alcohol level, and it was higher than allowed by law. They sent the case to the Taiwan Taichung District Prosecutors Office for breaking public safety laws. For running a red light, he will get a fine between NT$1800 and NT$5400, according to traffic rules.</p>

            <h1>Many Disagreements in Insurance Cases About "Necessary Medical Treatment"</h1>
            <p>The Financial Ombudsman Institution (FOI) reports that in the first half of this year, there were 7737 complaints and 3167 formal review cases. Looking at the complaints in the second quarter, insurance companies had the most, over 70%. Banks had 23%. For life insurance, most arguments were about whether medical treatment was "necessary" or not. For banks, most arguments were about credit card payments.</p>
            <p>If people have problems with financial services, the Financial Consumer Protection Act says they can first complain to the company. If that doesn't work, they can ask the FOI for help. FOI data from recent years shows that during the pandemic, many complaints came from problems with COVID-19 insurance. This made the total number of complaints very high in 2022 (52,288 cases) and 2023 (21,767 cases). Last year, the number of complaints went down and returned to normal.</p>
            <p>Looking closely at the types of problems the FOI saw in the first half of this year, banks often had problems with credit card payments or not explaining financial products and risks well. For life insurance, the main problem was about "necessary medical treatment." For property and casualty insurance, people often disagreed on how much money should be paid. For securities and futures, arguments were mostly about selling funds (including local and foreign investment funds).</p>
            <p>In the second quarter, there were 3680 complaints. Insurance companies had the most complaints, 71.52% or 2632 cases. Banks were next with 23.43% or 866 cases. Then came securities and futures companies with 4.29% or 158 cases. Finally, electronic payment companies had 0.65% or only 24 cases. Among insurance companies, life insurance had the most complaints with 1835 cases. Property and casualty insurance had 746 cases, and insurance agents had 51 cases.</p>
            <p>According to the numbers, life insurance companies had 1835 complaints in the second quarter. Most of these were about whether medical treatment was "necessary." This kind of problem happens when insurance policies cover medical actions and costs, but it's not always clear if the treatment was truly needed in practice.</p>
            <p>The FOI says that medical technology has improved in recent years. Many new medical treatments were not clearly stated in older insurance policies as covered. So, when people later ask for money for these treatments, there are often different ideas about whether they were "necessary." The FOI suggests that people should check if their insurance policy covers a medical service before they use it, to avoid problems later.</p>
            <p>Banks had 866 complaints in the second quarter, mostly about credit card payments. The FOI notes that some of these cases involve bad people tricking customers into giving them OTP (one-time password) messages. This hasn't led to more credit card disputes. Banks have recently improved how they show information in OTP messages, for example, by showing the currency. This helps customers know what they are paying for with their credit cards.</p>
            <p>Also, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) plans to put financing and leasing companies under rules in three steps. In the first step, 13 financing and leasing companies from four listed groups (Chailease, Yulon Finance, Hotai Finance, and Jih Sun Taichun) will follow the Financial Consumer Protection Act starting September 15. If these companies later advertise falsely, use force to collect debts, or break contract rules, people can complain to the FOI.</p>
            <p>Ms. Du Yi-ching, the chairperson of the FOI, said that they have already held several training sessions inside the organization. These included inviting judges and people from the industry to discuss possible problems with financing and leasing companies. The FOI also has special groups of review committee members ready for future cases. The FOI has also informed financing and leasing companies to make sure they understand how to handle disputes.</p>

            <h1>To Prevent Land Damage, People's Party Suggests Environmental Reviews Before Solar Power Projects</h1>
            <p>The People's Party has proposed changes to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act. They want to add rules for solar power systems. These rules would say that all solar projects must have an environmental review before they start. This includes projects in national parks, places where wild animals live, important wetlands, land owned by the government, hillside areas, and solar systems on water. The proposed changes were sent for a second reading by the parliament on August 29.</p>
            <p>Recently, pictures of old solar panels piled up after Typhoon Danas were shared online. People called them "solar panel graveyards," and this got a lot of attention. The People's Party held several press conferences before this to question the problem of discarded solar panels. They then suggested changes to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act to add rules for solar power systems.</p>
            <p>The People's Party stated in their proposal that solar power systems have often damaged the environment in recent years. This has led to "solar panels on mountains and solar panels in the sea." However, most solar projects do not need an environmental review. The Ministry of Environment did not act for a long time and neglected its duty. Only in January 2025 did it change the rules for when solar power projects need an environmental review, making the rules cover more projects.</p>
            <p>The People's Party pointed out that the current rules still have problems. Solar power systems on water do not need an environmental review. Also, some projects in certain areas do not need a review if the main authority agrees, which seems like a way to avoid the rules. To stop solar power systems from damaging the land again and again, it is important to make the environmental review rules for solar power stronger and apply them to more situations.</p>
            <p>The People's Party's proposed changes to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act add rules for solar power environmental reviews. They list 10 main types of project environments that need a review. First, projects in national parks, national scenic areas, or sensitive areas. Second, projects in wildlife protection areas or important habitats. Third, projects in important wetlands. Fourth, natural protected areas along the coast. Fifth, farmland in special agricultural zones. Sixth, land where the government supports or encourages planting trees, including government-owned land and land owned by public companies.</p>
            <p>The seventh part of the proposed change is for projects on hillsides. These need a review if they have a power capacity of 10,000 kilowatts or more, or cover an area of 5 hectares or more. The eighth part also covers hillside solar systems, but it also includes projects on the same plot of land or separated only by roads or drainage channels. The ninth part is for solar power systems on water. These need a review if they have a power capacity of 10,000 kilowatts or more, or cover an area of 5 hectares or more. The tenth part is for projects with a power capacity of 20,000 kilowatts or more, or covering an area of 10 hectares or more.</p>
            <p>However, the People's Party's proposed changes also clearly state that the rules for environmental reviews for solar power systems do not include solar systems on rooftops.</p>
            <p>The People's Party's proposed changes to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act were put on the agenda for the Legislative Yuan meeting on August 29. During that meeting, the People's Party suggested that the proposal go directly to a second reading. No one disagreed, so the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu, decided to send it to a second reading. The People's Party will then lead the discussions.</p>
