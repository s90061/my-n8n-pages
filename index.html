**Chinese Large Tugboat "United Offshore 5001" Enters Taiwanese Waters Without Obstruction**

A large Chinese tugboat, "United Offshore 5001," entered Taiwan's territorial waters without any apparent obstruction. The purpose of its tow is unknown. The Hengchun Coast Guard's PP3559 vessel reportedly ceased monitoring, citing an inability to receive the ship's signal. Taiwan ADIZ has issued a warning, stating that the "United Offshore 5001's" motives are unclear. Concerns are raised that if it is towing large military equipment or engaging in "grey zone" harassment, such as damaging Taiwan's undersea cables, strict monitoring and interception should be initiated.

**SEMICON Taiwan Upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week"**

SEMICON Taiwan 2025, the annual major event for the global semiconductor industry, officially launched on June 17. Coinciding with its 30th anniversary, the SEMI International Semiconductor Industry Association announced that the exhibition will be fully upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week." Meanwhile, amidst the US-China tech rivalry, with Trump pressuring allied companies to return through high tariffs, major manufacturers like TSMC face increased pressure regarding investments in the US. In the future, semiconductor companies will be forced to "choose sides," accelerating the regional reorganization of supply chains. Semiconductors have transitioned from commercial goods to strategic assets, shifting decision-making from "market efficiency" to "national security resilience."
