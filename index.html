Members of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are asking Taiwan's Ministry of Education to report a National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's football coach to the police. The coach is accused of forcing players to give blood for a study by threatening to take away their graduation credits. Some blood tests were done by people who were not doctors. Also, money given to students for being part of the study was illegally put into the team's fund. The Ministry of Education said they will deal with the issue quickly after checking with legal experts. The dean of NTNU's Sports and Leisure College apologized and said the coach's duties have been removed.

New Taipei City Councilor Li Yu-xiang from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claims that the Kuomintang (KMT) is offering NT$500 to people who attend an anti-recall event on July 19th. He said he has chat messages that prove this and asked legal authorities to investigate if this is against the law. However, the KMT's New Taipei City branch denied these claims. They said the accusation is "malicious smear and political manipulation" and that they do not have the money to pay people to join events.

**Japan Warns About China's Growing Military Actions**

Japan's latest defense report warns that China's increasing military activities could "seriously affect" Japan's safety. The report from Japan's Ministry of Defense said that for the first time, a Chinese military plane entered Japanese airspace last August. It also noted that a Chinese aircraft carrier and two naval ships sailed near two Japanese islands close to Taiwan in September. Japan believes that China's military goals are the "biggest strategic challenge" it has ever faced. The report also mentioned that Chinese fighter jets had a close encounter with Japanese planes and that Chinese coast guard ships often sail near the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Japan is now increasing its defense spending and working more closely with the US and other allies.
