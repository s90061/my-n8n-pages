            <h1>Israel Airstrikes on Qatar Condemned by Western Countries, Canada to Re-evaluate Relationship</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Israel attacked Doha, the capital city of Qatar, with airstrikes. These attacks were aimed at leaders of Hamas. Many Western countries, like the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the European Union, said this was wrong. Today, Canada announced that it will look again at its relationship with Israel.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Anita Anand, Canada's Foreign Minister, spoke to reporters. She was at a meeting for the Liberal Party, which is the party in power.</p>
            <p>Ms. Anand told reporters, "We are thinking about our relationship with Israel." She also said again that Canada believes Israel's attacks are not acceptable. This is especially true because Qatar is trying to help bring peace to the Middle East.</p>
            <p>When asked if Canada would put any kind of punishment on Israel, Ms. Anand answered, "We will keep thinking about what we should do next."</p>
            <p>Today, Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, said there will be new actions to help Ukraine against Russia's war. She also asked for limits on trade and punishments for Israel because of the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Regarding Israel's attack, Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the UK, said the attack went against Qatar's independence. He also said it could make the situation in the region worse.</p>
            <p>Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, clearly stated that no matter why Israel did it, such actions are "not acceptable."</p>
            <p>Johann Wadephul, the Foreign Minister of Germany, said in a statement, "Israel's attack on Doha not only went against Qatar's independence but also put at risk all our efforts to free the hostages. This attack is not acceptable."</p>

            <h1>NASA Bans Chinese Citizens from Space Programs; US-China Space Competition Rises</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg reported that people who know about the situation said the US space agency, NASA, has stopped Chinese citizens with US visas from taking part in its projects.</p>
            <p>NASA has always had some rules about hiring Chinese citizens. However, in the past, Chinese citizens who had US visas could still work with NASA. They could be outside workers, students studying for advanced degrees, or scientists from universities.</p>
            <p>But since September 5, Chinese citizens who were working at NASA have not been allowed to get into the agency's computer systems for information. They also cannot join meetings, either in person or online, that are connected to their work, according to people who know about it.</p>
            <p>Bethany Stevens, a spokesperson for NASA, confirmed these actions by the agency. Ms. Stevens said, "NASA has taken steps inside the agency concerning Chinese citizens. This includes limiting their access to our buildings, information, and computer networks to keep our work safe."</p>
            <p>Both China and the United States have plans to send people to the moon within the next five years.</p>
