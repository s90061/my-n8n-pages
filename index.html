**Elon Musk's SpaceX Invests $2 Billion in AI Company xAI**

SpaceX, Elon Musk's rocket company, has promised to invest $2 billion in his artificial intelligence (AI) company, xAI. This is part of a larger $5 billion investment for xAI. This shows that Musk's companies are working more closely together. xAI's chatbot, Grok, might be used in Tesla cars and also in Tesla's Optimus robots in the future. After xAI joined with the social media platform X, the company is now worth $113 billion. Grok also helps power SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service. Even though Grok has had some issues with its AI-generated content, Musk still calls it "the world's smartest AI."

**Taitung and Guam Work Together to Build a Traditional Boat**

An organization from Guam called Ulitao, which helps keep Chamorro seafaring traditions alive, is working with Taiwan's Taitung Indigenous Peoples College. They are building a traditional Austronesian boat together. The project will take three months, and they plan to launch and test the boat in October. The boat's design mixes old traditions from the Chamorro people of Guam, the Tao people of Taiwan, and the Amis people of Taiwan. This boat will be the biggest "Flying Proa" in Micronesia and will show how different cultures can work together. The project aims to reconnect the cultures and histories of these island nations, as Taiwan is seen as the original homeland for Austronesian people.
