**Criminal group illegally imports beauty devices, 12 suspects sent to court**

A group illegally brought medical beauty devices from places like China. They then rented these devices to beauty clinics. Police in Taipei arrested 12 people, including a 51-year-old man who runs a medical device company.

The police started to investigate after getting a tip. They found that this group was bringing in illegal beauty devices and letting clinics use them. These devices were not approved by the health authorities, and the original makers did not give permission.

The group, run by four brothers named Huang, brought in devices like "Phoenix Waves" and medicines illegally. They rented them to many beauty clinics in Taipei and New Taipei City. Patients who did not know used these devices, which could be dangerous for their health and safety.

Yesterday and today, the police searched the companies and clinics involved. They found the four Huang brothers and their employees. Today, these 12 suspects were sent to court for breaking laws about medical devices, fraud, and doctors' practice.

It was thought that a well-known doctor's beauty clinic was also involved, but police checks showed their equipment was legal. Police are still looking into where these illegal devices came from and which clinics were involved. They are also tracing where the devices went.
