After Typhoon Doksuri caused power outages in central and southern Taiwan, ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute) sent its "E-CUBE" mobile energy storage system to disaster areas. This system helps provide electricity for daily needs, medical devices, and even mobile base stations.

ITRI also worked with a new company called Hydrogen Rich Energy to use hydrogen fuel cell systems. These systems helped restore communication for Chunghwa Telecom's base stations in Qigu Xiliao Village.

Furthermore, ITRI opened its Liujia campus dorms to give Taipower workers a place to rest, offering water, hot meals, and washing facilities. More than 300 repair workers have used this help.

The Taitung County Environmental Protection Bureau organized this event to promote valuing food and sustainable living. About 30 groups, including professional chefs and environmental educators, joined the competition.

The environmental bureau hopes to continue similar events to encourage low-carbon eating and zero food waste. This effort is part of Taitung's "slow economy" idea, which connects respecting food with protecting the environment for a better future.
