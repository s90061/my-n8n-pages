            <h1>Homeless Man Steals Dog, Abuses It, and Throws It into Keelung River; Police Take Action</h1>
            <p>In August, a homeless man named Hu from New Taipei City was accused of stealing a black dog in Tamsui. He then hurt the dog in a park and threw its body into the Keelung River. The dog's owner reported it missing to the police. The police started looking for the dog and today asked Mr. Hu to come for questioning. After questioning, he was sent to court for stealing, causing damage, and breaking the Animal Protection Act.</p>
            <p>Someone recently posted on Threads, a social media platform, asking for help to find the black dog. The post said that a couple saw the black dog being "hung up and beaten" in a park in Taipei City. The homeless man at that time said it was his dog and that he was "teaching it a lesson because it was naughty." The couple recorded what happened and called the police. However, the dog was gone when the police arrived.</p>
            <p>The Tamsui Police Station of New Taipei City explained that on August 19, a man named Li reported that his black dog was taken by a stranger. The police checked surveillance videos and found Mr. Hu, 61, was likely involved. They asked him to come to the station early this morning.</p>
            <p>It is understood that Mr. Hu claimed the black dog barked at him when he passed Fisherman's Wharf. He said he took the dog because it was noisy. The police stated that Mr. Hu admitted to stealing the black dog. He then took it to a park in Taipei City and hurt it. After the dog died, he threw its body into the Keelung River. After police questioning, the case was sent to the Shilin District Prosecutors Office for investigation, as required by law.</p>

            <h1>Over 800 People Die in Afghanistan Earthquake, Villages Destroyed, People Sleep Outside</h1>
            <p>A 6-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan a few days ago. Many villages were completely destroyed. So far, more than 800 people have died. Many people have lost their homes and are sleeping on the streets. Today, rescue workers are still looking for survivors in the broken buildings.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, the earthquake happened late at night on August 31. It badly affected Kunar Province, which is a far-off area close to Pakistan.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake's center was 27 kilometers northeast of Jalalabad city in Nangarhar Province. The earthquake was only 8 kilometers deep.</p>
            <p>Many simple houses made of mud and stone, located in steep valleys, fell down because of the earthquake. Rescue teams searched all night to try and save people trapped under the fallen buildings.</p>
            <p>Zafar Khan Gojar, a 22-year-old who lost his home, said, "The earthquake broke the rooms and walls. Some children died, and some people got hurt." Gojar and his family have moved from Nurgal to Jalalabad city.</p>
            <p>Villagers wrapped the bodies of dead children in white cloths. They prayed for them before burying them. At the same time, helicopters kept taking injured people to hospitals.</p>
            <p>Other people told reporters, "Everyone is scared and worried... Children and women screamed in fear. We have never seen such a terrible situation in our lives."</p>
            <p>Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesperson for the Taliban government, said that in Kunar Province alone, near the earthquake's center, about 800 people died and 2,500 were injured.</p>
            <p>Ehsanullah Ehsan, head of disaster management in Kunar Province, told reporters, "Many people are still trapped under the fallen roofs of their homes." He also warned that the number of deaths could go up even more.</p>
            <p>UN organizations told AFP that in some affected villages in Kunar Province, the roads were blocked. This made rescue work difficult.</p>
            <p>Afghanistan often has earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush Mountains area, where the Eurasian plate and the Indian plate meet.</p>
            <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement yesterday that the United Nations is working with the Afghan government. They want to "quickly check what is needed, give emergency help, and be ready to send more resources."</p>
            <p>He said the UN's global emergency fund has already given 5 million US dollars (about 150 million New Taiwan dollars) as a first payment.</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Ice Products: Over a Quarter Fail First Test, Nearly 10% Still Fail Second Test</h1>
            <p>Eating ice is a popular way to cool down in summer. Today, the Taipei City Health Department announced the results of its second round of checks on loose ice products and toppings in May and June. They tested 108 items in total, which included 47 ice products, 12 types of edible ice, and 49 drinks. In the first test, 29 items (26.85%) did not meet the standards. After being re-tested, 10 items, almost 10%, still failed.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Health Department shared the results of its second check of loose drinks, ice products, and toppings for the year 2025. Section Chief Lin Guan-zhen said that the tests were done around May and June. They checked for different germs and bacteria in food, such as Salmonella, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, and E. coli O157:H7, based on food safety rules.</p>
            <p>She explained that 29 of the drinks and ice products failed the first test. The businesses were told to fix the problems by a certain date. However, 10 items still failed after the second test. This means they broke Article 17 and Article 48, paragraph 8, of the "Food Safety and Health Management Act." Because of this, the businesses that made these products will have to pay a fine of at least NT$30,000 and up to NT$3,000,000.</p>
            <p>When asked if the products that failed the first test were stopped from being sold, she said that businesses have about two weeks to make changes. Food safety law says that fines are given only if products fail the second test; there is no rule to stop sales after the first failure. In reality, most businesses choose to stop selling the products themselves. They quickly find the problem and fix it so they don't get fined if they fail the second test.</p>
            <p>Lin Guan-zhen said that Enterobacteriaceae is used to check the cleanliness of water, ice products, and food. It also shows if there are any problems with hygiene during the production process. If the level is too high, it means the cleanliness during making, the ingredients, tools, or packaging might be dirty. Also, keeping products at room temperature is the best way for germs to grow. Too much Enterobacteriaceae can make ice products lower in quality and spoil faster.</p>
