New information from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that many families are still finding it hard to manage their money. Despite some prices going down, the overall cost of living remains high. People are especially feeling the pinch when it comes to food, energy bills, and housing.

The ONS survey found that about half of all adults in the UK said their cost of living went up in the last month. This means that everyday items and services are still expensive for many. While inflation, which is the rate at which prices go up, has slowed down, it doesn't mean prices are actually falling. It just means they are not rising as fast.

This situation makes it difficult for households to save money or even cover their basic needs. Many families are changing their spending habits, for example, buying cheaper food or using less electricity, to try and cope with the ongoing high costs.

**How AI Might Change Our Jobs More Than We Think**

A new report suggests that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could change the world of work more than we first expected. While AI is already transforming many industries, its full impact on jobs might be even bigger. The report explains that AI will not just replace some jobs; it will also create new ones and change how many other jobs are done.

For example, AI can help with tasks like writing emails, analyzing data, or managing schedules. This means that people might spend less time on these routine tasks and more time on creative or problem-solving work. The report emphasizes that workers will need new skills to work alongside AI. Learning about technology, critical thinking, and social skills will become more important.

Some experts believe that as AI takes over simpler tasks, new types of jobs will appear that need human skills. However, others worry that the speed of these changes could be a challenge for the job market. Businesses and governments will need to help people learn the skills for the future.

**Can Technology Help Solve Overtourism?**

Many popular travel spots around the world are facing a problem called "overtourism." This happens when too many tourists visit a place at the same time, which can harm the environment, local culture, and make life difficult for the people who live there. Now, some people are asking if technology can help find a solution.

When an area has too many visitors, it can lead to overcrowded beaches, damaged historical sites, and too much waste. Local communities often feel that their quality of life goes down. Travel experts are looking at new ways to manage this. For example, apps and smart systems could help spread tourists out more evenly, suggesting less busy times or alternative places to visit.

Technology could also help visitors learn about responsible travel, showing them how to respect local rules and traditions. Some places are using data to understand visitor flows better and make plans to reduce the negative effects of tourism. The goal is to make travel sustainable, so that popular places can be enjoyed by both tourists and locals for a long time.
