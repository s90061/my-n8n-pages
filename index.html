            <h1>Zheng Haojun Pitches Well for 5 Innings, Gao Yujie's 2 Hits and 3 RBIs Help Brothers Win</h1>
            <p>The CTBC Brothers baseball team won today. Their pitcher, Zheng Haojun, pitched for 5 innings and did not let the other team score any runs. Gao Yujie, another player, had a great game with 2 hits and 3 RBIs (runs batted in). The Brothers beat the Fubon Guardians 8-0. Gao Yujie was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the game.</p>
            <p>The Brothers played against the Guardians today at their home field, the Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. Their starting pitcher was "Meimei" Zheng Haojun. Zheng Haojun did not allow any hits in the first 3 innings. The Guardians only got on base by walks (when the pitcher throws four bad pitches) or by being hit by the ball. In the 4th inning, after two players were out, Shen Haowei hit a double. But Zheng Haojun still did not let them score.</p>
            <p>Zheng Haojun threw 71 pitches in total and played for 5 innings. He only let the other team get 1 hit. He gave 4 walks (or hit batters) and struck out 3 batters. He did not let the other team score any runs. This was his 4th win this season. The official Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) data showed his fastest pitch was 154 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>In the first inning, the Brothers scored first. Yue Zhenhua hit a double, Xu Jihong got a walk, and Wang Zhengshun hit a single. In the second inning, Jiang Kunyu got a walk. After one player was out, Gao Yujie hit a single and got another run for the team.</p>
            <p>In the third inning, after one player was out, Wang Zhengshun got a walk and Zeng Songen was hit by the ball. They moved to other bases because of a wild pitch (when the pitcher throws a bad pitch that the catcher cannot catch easily). Jiang Kunyu hit a single and got another run. Then Yue Donghua also got a walk. Gao Yujie then hit a single, which brought in 2 runs and made the team's lead bigger.</p>
            <p>In the fifth inning, after one player was out, the Brothers started to score again. Yue Donghua got a walk, and Gao Yujie was hit by the ball. Zhang Renwei hit a single and got a run. Yue Zhenhua also hit a single, which continued the scoring. They scored more runs with a ground ball and a sacrifice fly. They got 3 more runs in this inning to make their lead even safer.</p>
            <p>Gao Yujie played as the starting catcher. He did well both in hitting and defending. He had 2 hits in 3 times at bat and brought in 3 runs. He was chosen as the MVP of the game. When he was asked how he builds trust and works well with the pitchers, Gao Yujie said that they talk a lot normally. During games, he shares his ideas to see if they both agree. He said they keep making changes and discussing things to work well together.</p>

            <h1>Indian Air Force: 6 Pakistani Military Aircraft Shot Down During May Conflict</h1>
            <p>The Chief of the Indian Air Force, Air Chief Marshal Singh, said today that during a conflict with Pakistan in May, the Indian Air Force shot down 5 enemy fighter jets and one military aircraft. This is the first time New Delhi has said this, months after the most serious military conflict between the two long-time rivals in decades.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Singh stated this at an event in Bengaluru, a large city in southern India. He said that most of the Pakistani planes were shot down by Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. He used electronic tracking data to confirm these hits.</p>
            <p>He said, "We have confirmed that at least 5 were shot down, and also one large aircraft." Singh said that the large aircraft he was talking about might have been a reconnaissance aircraft (a plane that collects information). It was shot down from 300 kilometers away. "This is actually the longest surface-to-air shot ever known," he stated. The people listening at the event, including active air force officers, retired military members, government officials, and business people, applauded loudly.</p>
            <p>The Pakistani military did not immediately answer when asked for comments. Singh did not say what types of Pakistani fighter jets were shot down by India. However, he said that during the air attacks, India also hit a reconnaissance aircraft and "several F-16 fighter jets" that were parked in hangars at two air bases in southern Pakistan.</p>
            <p>The two nuclear-armed neighbors in South Asia had a military conflict from May 7th to May 10th. Islamabad, whose air force mainly uses Chinese-made jets and American F-16 fighter jets, had previously said that none of their planes were shot down in that fight. They also claimed that they shot down 6 Indian planes during that time, including one French-made Rafale fighter jet.</p>
            <p>India said that they had some losses, but they said that they did not lose 6 planes.</p>
