            <h1>Opposition Party Says Cash Handouts Are Legal; Premier Cho Jung-tai Says Do Not Ignore the Law</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 17, Central News Agency reporters Lai Yu-chen, Kao Hua-chien) The Legislative Yuan recently passed a special law. This law adds a NT$10,000 cash handout for everyone. Some people questioned if this was against the law or the constitution. But the opposition parties said it was not. Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that the Constitution's Article 70 and the Budget Act have rules about this. He said the opposition parties should not ignore these laws as if they do not know them.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan recently passed the special law for the third time. It set aside NT$545 billion. It also clearly stated that everyone would receive NT$10,000 in cash. The law did not include NT$100 billion to help Taiwan Power Company. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Executive Yuan questioned if giving cash was against the law or the constitution. However, the opposition parties said that the budget bill cannot increase spending, and this special law is not a budget bill.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai held a press conference with Executive Yuan Secretary-General Kung Ming-hsin, spokesperson Li Hui-chih, and Deputy Director-General of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Chen Hui-chuan. They explained how the government used extra money from tax income between 2021 and 2024. He also shared his thoughts on the cash handout.</p>
            <p>Regarding the extra money, Premier Cho said that from 2021 to 2024, the tax income was about NT$1.8707 trillion more than planned. But after giving money to local governments, special funds, paying off debts, and special budgets for fighter jets and the pandemic, there is only NT$443.6 billion left. However, the special budget passed by the Legislative Yuan includes the cash handout, which makes the total amount NT$545 billion. This means the government will need to borrow about NT$101.4 billion.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho explained that giving cash goes against the Constitution and the Budget Act. The government is thinking about whether to give the cash handout from a moral and financial point of view for the country. He said, "Should we borrow money to give cash? We are thinking about this now." He also hopes to explain this to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
            <p>The media asked if the Executive Yuan would ask for a reconsideration to discuss the cash handout with the Legislative Yuan again. Premier Cho replied that he respects the Legislative Yuan's plans. He just wants to explain important national finances and how to review budgets legally and constitutionally. He also hopes to reach an agreement on what is constitutional, to keep a small chance for the plan to be saved. He also hopes that society will continue to speak up for justice, so citizens can decide.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho explained that people have different opinions on the cash handout. Some want to use it fully, while others think it should not be given. He hopes that NT$235 billion can stay with the government. This money could be used to buy equipment for national security, drones, fix military equipment, build food storage facilities, and improve public facilities and shelters. He said, "Borrowing money to give NT$10,000 cash is really a struggle for me."</p>
            <p>The media also asked that the Kuomintang (KMT) believes the special law is a legal bill, not a budget bill, so there is no constitutional problem. They also questioned if it is unconstitutional for the Executive Yuan not to follow the special law passed by the Legislative Yuan when making the budget.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho replied that Article 70 of the Constitution and Article 91 of the Budget Act cover both legal bills and budget bills. He said that when the Legislative Yuan changes a legal bill proposed by the Executive Yuan, it is a change to the legal bill. He asked, "Will the changed opinions suddenly appear?"</p>
            <p>Premier Cho warned, "The opposition parties should not ignore legal articles like someone who does not know the law." He said the Constitution clearly states that the Executive Yuan makes the budget and the Legislative Yuan reviews it. He added that the Legislative Yuan increased so many government expenses without asking the Executive Yuan's opinion. He questioned where the country's financial rules are. He said that no matter how legal and reasonable the opposition parties think the budget is, the process must be correct.</p>
            <p>Regarding what legal actions the Executive Yuan will take in the future, Premier Cho stressed that the Executive Yuan has already taken action many times against laws and budgets from the Legislative Yuan that were not legal or constitutional. He said the Executive Yuan will bravely take on its constitutional duty. He added, "We will think about it in the same way as before."</p>
            <p>Article 70 of the Constitution says that the Legislative Yuan cannot suggest increasing spending for a budget bill proposed by the Executive Yuan. Also, Article 91 of the Budget Act states that if a legal bill proposed by a legislator greatly increases spending or decreases income, they must first ask the Executive Yuan for its opinion and explain where the money will come from. If necessary, they should also suggest changes to other laws.</p>

            <h1>Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong Found Not Guilty of Accounting Fraud and Stock Manipulation by Supreme Court</h1>
            <p>(Seoul, July 17, Central News Agency) South Korea's Supreme Court today said that Samsung Group chairman Lee Jae-yong is not guilty. The court agreed with two earlier decisions by lower courts. These decisions confirmed that he was not involved in accounting fraud or manipulating stock prices in a 2015 merger worth $8 billion.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Supreme Court's decision finally ends Lee Jae-yong's long-running legal problems. This also allows Samsung to catch up in the global race to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court in South Korea upheld the appeals court's decision. It rejected all accusations in the case. This case was about the merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries 10 years ago. At that time, prosecutors said the merger was to give Lee Jae-yong more control over Samsung.</p>
            <p>Lower courts also found Lee Jae-yong not guilty last year.</p>
            <p>Samsung's lawyers said they are "very grateful" for the court's decision. In a statement, they said the decision proves the merger was legal.</p>
            <p>After the decision was announced, Samsung Electronics' stock price did not change much. It only went up a little by 1.7%.</p>
            <p>Although the Supreme Court's decision was expected, it came at a good time for Lee Jae-yong. He is the chairman of Samsung Electronics, the world's largest maker of memory chips and smartphones. In recent years, people have questioned his leadership. This is because the company faces more competition and is trying to catch up in AI chips.</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-yong has been dealing with lawsuits for almost 10 years. These problems started because his father, Lee Kun-hee, had a heart attack and became unconscious in 2014. Lee Jae-yong arranged the merger to take over the company.</p>

            <h1>Eye Acupuncture Improves Vision Problems Like Double Vision; Combining Chinese and Western Medicine Provides Better Care</h1>
            <p>(Kaohsiung, July 17, Central News Agency reporter Lin Chiao-lien) A 40-year-old man from Kaohsiung, named Lin, recently started seeing double. He went to the Chinese Medicine Department at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUH). After eye acupuncture treatment, his double vision got much better. Other cases where this treatment was used with Western medicine also showed good results. These results were published in the "Journal of Chinese Medicine Research."</p>
            <p>Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital held a press conference today to talk about eye acupuncture. KMUH said that acupuncture is often used for muscle pain like shoulder or back pain. But Chinese medicine acupuncture can be used for many things. Especially, "eye acupuncture" has shown good results in treating eye diseases in recent years.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin recently started having "double vision." He saw two overlapping images at the same time with one eye. This made it hard for him to focus on work and greatly affected his daily life. A friend suggested he go to the Chinese Medicine Department at KMUH. After two treatments, his double vision got much better.</p>
            <p>KMUH Vice President Dai Chia-yen said that eyes are very important. When eye diseases like dry eyes, optic nerve atrophy (when the nerve wears out), or glaucoma happen, they not only affect vision but also badly affect life quality. KMUH treats eye diseases by finding the right treatment for each person. They also use skilled acupuncture techniques. Chinese and Western medicine work together to give people better and more complete care.</p>
            <p>Dr. Tsai Cheng-hsun, Director of KMUH's Chinese Medicine Department, said that eye acupuncture is a type of acupuncture. It uses very small needles to stimulate points around the eyes and on the body for overall health. Doctors use special thin, soft needles. They put them into points around the eye socket, like Jingming and Qiuhou points. The needles go along the outer muscle layer of the eyeball, up to 3 to 5 centimeters deep. This helps to improve blood flow in the eyes, make nerves and muscles more active, and increase tear production.</p>
            <p>Dr. Hsu Ching-hsiang, an attending physician in KMUH's Chinese Medicine Department, said that many studies have shown that eye acupuncture really helps improve vision. In reviews of many studies and big data analysis, eye acupuncture can increase blood flow to the back of the eye and oxygen in the retina. This helps to slow down eye problems and help optic nerves grow again.</p>
            <p>Dr. Hsu Ching-hsiang reminded that because eye acupuncture uses deep needles, and the needles are close to the eyeball and important blood vessels and nerves, doctors need a lot of practice to do it skillfully and safely. So, only trained Chinese medicine doctors should do it. Also, eye check-ups like OCT scans (Optical Coherence Tomography) and visual field tests should be done to help check progress.</p>
