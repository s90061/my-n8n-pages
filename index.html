            <h1>US-Japan Military Exercise Shows Typhon Missile System in Japan; China Calls for Its Removal</h1>
            <p>On September 15, after China's military parade, the US military showed its "Typhon" missile system at the Iwakuni base in Japan. This was the first time the system was seen in Japan. Today, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said that China is very unhappy and strongly against the US and Japan putting this system in Japan. He asked the US and Japan to "quickly remove" the system.</p>
            <p>Lin Jian said this during a regular press conference in the afternoon. He added that the US and Japan did not listen to China's serious concerns. They chose to place the Typhon missile system in Japan under the name of joint military exercises. China is very upset and strongly disagrees.</p>
            <p>He stated that when the US places the Typhon missile system in Asian countries, it hurts the safety of other nations. It also makes the arms race and military conflict in the area more likely. This creates a real danger to the region's overall safety.</p>
            <p>Lin Jian asked the US and Japan to truly respect other countries' safety worries. He urged them to act in a way that helps bring peace and stability to the region, not the opposite. China asked the US and Japan to "listen to what countries in the region are saying, fix their wrong actions, and quickly remove" the Typhon missile system.</p>
            <p>He also said that because of Japan's history of military aggression, its military actions are always watched closely by its Asian neighbors and the world. This year marks 80 years since the victory of "the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." China asks Japan to think deeply about its history of aggression. It should continue on a path of peace and "be careful with its words and actions" in military matters. China warned Japan not to "help a tyrant" or "do things that break trust with its Asian neighbors and harm peace and stability in the region."</p>
            <p>Foreign news reports said that "Resolute Dragon," a large US-Japan military exercise, started on September 11 in Japan. About 19,000 people are expected to take part in the two-week exercise. On September 15, the US Army officially showed the Typhon medium-range missile system at the US Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. They also practiced deploying it. This was the first public display of the system in Japan.</p>
            <p>Before being shown in Japan, the Typhon missile system was seen in Australia in July during the "Exercise Talisman Sabre 2025." The US military also tested it with live ammunition there. This was the first time the US tested this system outside of America. In 2024, the system was shown in the Philippines and has not been removed since. This has made China very angry.</p>
            <p>Reports say the Typhon missile system can carry SM-6 interceptor missiles and "Tomahawk" cruise missiles. These missiles can travel up to 480 kilometers. If the system is placed in Japan, its range could cover the eastern coast of China and parts of Russia.</p>
            <p>Colonel Wade Germann, who leads the US military task force for this system, said that it will be removed from Japan after the joint military exercise ends. However, he did not say where the system would go next or if it would be brought back to Japan. (Editor: Qiu Guoqiang) 1140916</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rains Cause Landslides in Malaysia's Sabah, Killing at Least 12 People</h1>
            <p>Kuala Lumpur, September 16 (CNA) â€“ News reports today state that heavy rains hit the eastern part of Borneo Island in Malaysia over the past week. This caused several landslides in Sabah state, leading to at least 12 deaths.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), rescue teams reported that more than 2,000 people had to leave their homes. These people lived in low-lying areas, including around Kota Kinabalu, the capital city of Sabah, because of recent floods.</p>
            <p>The New Straits Times reported that the worst event happened yesterday. Rocks and soil hit a temporary housing area on the edge of Kota Kinabalu. This killed 8 people, including 4 children.</p>
            <p>Another landslide happened yesterday in the Gana area, about 100 kilometers east of Kota Kinabalu. Three people died in this event, including a 10-year-old girl. Last week, in the Penampang area outside Kota Kinabalu, a 97-year-old man was buried by mud.</p>
            <p>Sabah state is in the northeast of Borneo. It is the poorest state in Malaysia. For the past 10 days, it has experienced heavy rain. This has caused low-lying areas to flood and led to landslides. Homes and public buildings have been damaged.</p>
            <p>Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, sent rescue teams yesterday evening to help with the disaster. (Translator: Lin Yifeng) 1140916</p>

            <h1>TSMC Stock Reaches New High 5 Times in One Month; Foreign Investors Continue to Buy Many Shares</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 16 (CNA) â€“ Today, TSMC, a leading chip company, quickly regained its dividend value as its stock went ex-dividend. During the trading day, its price went up to 1285 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD). It closed at 1280 NTD, which is a new record high for its closing price. Since August 13, when TSMC first closed at 1200 NTD, its stock has reached a new high 5 times in about one month. This shows its amazing strength.</p>
            <p>Last week, foreign investors bought a large number of TSMC shares, specifically 61,711 units. Yesterday, they sold a small amount, 836 units. However, today, they bought back 13,671 units. This continued buying helps the stock price keep going up.</p>
            <p>On August 13, TSMC's stock price first closed at 1200 NTD. From September 10 to 12, it set new closing price records for three days in a row. Today, the stock closed at 1280 NTD, an increase of 30 NTD. This means it has once again set a new record for its closing price.</p>
            <p>Today, TSMC paid a dividend of 5 NTD per share. The total amount of dividends paid will be 129.663 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This money will be given out on October 9. This dividend payout affects the overall stock market by about 40.43 points.</p>
            <p>Since 2019, TSMC has been paying dividends every quarter. All 24 times it has paid dividends, its stock price has successfully returned to its original level before the dividend payment (called "ex-dividend"). Out of these times, 18 times the stock quickly recovered on the same day the dividend was paid. The longest time it took for the stock to recover was 15 trading days. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it took 10 trading days for the cash dividend to fully recover. Today, TSMC's stock recovered its dividend value immediately. This brings the number of times it has recovered on the same day to 19. (Editor: Zhang Junmao) 1140916</p>
