            <h1>Michigan Governor Visits Singapore; Prime Minister Wong Says Cooperation with US Helps Competitiveness</h1>
            <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is visiting Singapore. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that Singapore relies on trade. Working with the U.S. at both federal and state levels helps Singapore become a trusted global hub. This also helps Singapore stay competitive.</p>
            <p>Governor Whitmer recently visited Singapore. Last night, Prime Minister Wong posted on Facebook. He said he is an alumnus of the University of Michigan and was happy to welcome Whitmer and her team. They came to Singapore to talk about working together in technology, advanced manufacturing, and making supply chains strong.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Wong has a Master's degree in Economics from the University of Michigan. He also has a Master's degree in Public Administration from Harvard Kennedy School. He started his career as a civil servant, working as an economic analyst for the Ministry of Trade and Industry.</p>
            <p>The free trade agreement between Singapore and the United States started in 2004. Since then, trade between the two countries has grown. The U.S. has a trade surplus with Singapore. Singapore's tax rate is 10% on the U.S. President Trump's tariff list, which is quite low.</p>
            <p>Experts like Lee Soon-heng, an economic analyst at Maybank, believe that Singapore faces the lowest U.S. tariffs in Asia. This makes its exports more competitive than those from other U.S. trading partners. International companies from countries with higher tariffs might think about making more products in Singapore. A recent report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said that Singapore received the highest amount of foreign direct investment ever. In 2024, it became the second-highest globally, after the U.S.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Wong stated that Singapore is a small and open country that depends on trade. It relies on building strong partnerships with countries all over the world. The United States is already the biggest source of foreign investment for Singapore. It is also Singapore's main partner for trading services and its third-largest partner for trading goods.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Wong said, "Our cooperation at the federal and state levels helps Singapore become a trusted global center. It also helps us stay competitive." He hopes that Governor Whitmer's visit will bring good results for the people of both Singapore and the U.S.</p>
            <p>Governor Whitmer is a politician from the U.S. Democratic Party and was a lawyer before. She has been the Governor of Michigan since 2019. She once visited Taiwan and announced that Michigan would open an office there. This was to attract Taiwanese businesses to invest in the U.S. and make trade links stronger.</p>

            <h1>TSMC's Weak Ascent; Taiwan Stock Market Falls Back After High Opening</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market started high but then went down in early trading. Around 10 AM, the main index turned negative. By 10:30 AM, the stock market index had a small gain of 6.51 points, reaching 24078.24 points. The total value of shares traded was about NT$206.5 billion.</p>
            <p>TSMC's stock price went up by NT$10 to NT$1175 at the start of trading, but then it fell. Hon Hai's stock went up by NT$5 to NT$203.5 at most. MediaTek's stock went up by NT$20 to NT$1380 at most. After these early gains, all their increases became smaller.</p>
            <p>Last week, Nittobo, a large Japanese company that makes glass fiber, decided to spend about 15 billion Japanese Yen. This money is for building a new factory and making more products. Because of this, the idea that there would be a shortage of materials for PCBs (printed circuit boards) did not work out. Recently, popular stocks in the glass fiber industry went down a lot. Taiwan Glass's stock price dropped to its lowest allowed price of NT$28.75. Fuqiao's stock also fell by more than 9% during the day.</p>
            <p>Analysts from Capital Investment Trust said that on August 7, the U.S. set new tariffs between 15% and 50%. The uncertainty about these tariffs is now gone, which helped the stock market react well. Also, the popularity of AI and technology stocks continued. Furthermore, the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, suggested that interest rates might be lowered in September. All these things encouraged the market.</p>
            <p>Capital Investment Trust believes that the market is currently focusing on two main things: "AI and the Fed's policies." Taiwan's stock market has successfully tried to reach its previous highest point. Stocks related to AI, like those for advanced semiconductor manufacturing and important parts for AI servers, are worth watching.</p>

            <h1>Homeowner Hired Renovation Team, But 5 Thieves Stole Valuables Instead</h1>
            <p>A house in Miaoli City was recently being renovated. However, the homeowner hired a group of workers who turned out to be thieves. They stole items during the night, including two large wooden treasure basins. The total loss was about NT$800,000. After police investigated, they went to Hsinchu County and arrested five people, including a man named Zhong, for legal action.</p>
            <p>Xue Yuhong, the deputy leader of the investigation team at the Miaoli County Police Bureau's Miaoli Precinct, said today that they received a report from a person a few days ago. The report said that wooden treasure basins and many other items kept in a house in Miaoli City were stolen. The total value of the stolen items was about NT$800,000. A special team was quickly formed to investigate. After looking at security camera footage, they found a suspicious truck. By tracking the truck, they identified certain people involved in the crime.</p>
            <p>Police found out that in early August, the homeowner who was robbed hired a supervisor named Peng. Peng then hired four workers, including Mr. Zhong (57 years old), to renovate the house. During the renovation, many of the owner's collected items in the house slowly disappeared. The homeowner became suspicious of the workers and called the police.</p>
            <p>The police asked Prosecutor Wu Chia-wei from the Miaoli District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. After looking at the security camera footage, they found that Mr. Zhong and others drove a truck to the house at night. They climbed a ladder from the back of the house and went inside. They took two large wooden treasure basins made of Chinese cypress, which are worth about NT$700,000.</p>
            <p>On August 27, the police went to the Xinfu area of Hsinchu County with a search warrant from the Miaoli District Court. They arrested the supervisor Peng and five other people, including Mr. Zhong. At Mr. Zhong's rented home, they found the two large wooden treasure basins and the other stolen items. All the stolen items were given back to the homeowner. After questioning, the five suspects were sent to the Miaoli District Prosecutors Office to be investigated for aggravated theft.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli Precinct reminds people that when they renovate their homes, valuable items inside should be kept safely or put in a safe. This will prevent them from becoming targets for thieves.</p>
