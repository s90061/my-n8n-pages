            <h1>AI Net-Zero: Dehchuan Starts Biodegradable Hot Melt Adhesive Line to Boost Green Materials Business</h1>
            <p>Changing to digital ways of working is happening in industries now. Artificial intelligence and reaching net-zero carbon emissions are two big challenges for governments and companies. These are important for Taiwan's future success. The Central News Agency's reporting team went to see how the government and different businesses are using AI to make their production better and to create new green ideas. They saw Taiwan's industries making progress again.</p>
            <p>Dehchuan Enterprise spent five years getting ready. Today, they officially opened Asia's first "biodegradable hot melt adhesive production line" and a new research and development building called "Innovation Building" at their factory in Taoyuan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsiao Hsiang-chih, the chairman of Dehchuan, said that in the first half of 2025, 86% of the company's main adhesive products will be made from green materials. Out of this, 24% will be new green materials. The company has brought together its global research, development, and management teams. They have worked together to create over 100 new green products and technologies.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsiao Hsiang-chih explained that their green products and solutions are used in many industries. These include the "GPS plastic-free stretch film" for reducing plastic and carbon, which is a sustainable solution. They also make glue for car parts in new energy vehicles, easy-to-remove hot melt glue, glues made from natural sources, low-smell and low-waste hot melt glue, and eco-friendly fire-resistant hot melt glue without halogens.</p>
            <p>He said that because of serious problems like global warming, climate change, and the need for environmental protection, Dehchuan has been working on these issues. They started by promoting sustainable materials from natural sources. Now, they are focusing on net-zero carbon emissions, which is a very important topic. They are developing materials and solutions that are good for the environment, safe, and healthy.</p>
            <p>Also, in 2021, Dehchuan worked with other companies that supply and use their products. They created the GPS Green Materials Strategic Cooperation Platform. Through different collaborations, they have built new technologies and partnerships. This helps industries become more eco-friendly and move towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
