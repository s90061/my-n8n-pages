            <h1>Chikungunya Spreads: Shanghai Now at Risk of Outbreaks</h1>
            <p>The Chikungunya disease in Guangdong, China, now has over 9,000 cases. It is also spreading to other areas. Guangxi and Zhejiang are now listed as high-risk areas (Category 1) for Chikungunya. Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Anhui are now Category 2 areas, meaning there is some risk of many people getting sick together.</p>
            <p>The health authority in Guangdong reported on August 10 that from August 3 to August 9, there were 1,387 new local Chikungunya cases in Guangdong. The total number of cases reached 9,103. Even though the number of new cases is going down, the disease is spreading to nearby places. There are also a few cases in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and parts of China like Beijing, Hunan, and Hubei.</p>
            <p>On August 12, China's national health authority announced that six provinces and regions are now Category 1 areas for Chikungunya prevention. These are Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hainan, Yunnan, and Guangxi.</p>
            <p>The Chinese government divides the risk of Chikungunya (called "Ji Kong Kan Ya fever" in China) into four categories, from highest (1) to lowest (4). Category 1 areas are places where mosquitoes are active for a long time, and where many local dengue fever cases have been reported before. These areas have a higher risk of many people getting sick together.</p>
            <p>Category 2 areas include 11 provinces and regions: Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, Sichuan, and Guizhou. These areas have a relatively long period when mosquitoes are active, or they have had local dengue fever cases before. They have some risk of many people getting sick together.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare's Centers for Disease Control said recently that Chikungunya does not spread from person to person. China's national health authority said that Chikungunya is caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). It is a sudden illness spread by mosquito bites. The main signs of the illness are fever, joint pain, and skin rash.</p>

            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai Talks with Machinery Industry, Hopes New Resilience Law Starts Soon</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai went to Taichung today to meet with people from the machinery and machine tool industries. He said that the government approved a new draft law for resilience today. He hopes the Legislative Yuan will quickly support it. This will allow the money to be used soon, so they can support industries earlier.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Premier Cho visited CHING HONG MACHINERY & ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD. in Taichung. He also had a meeting with people from the machinery and machine tool industries. The Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, Legislative Yuan Vice President Chiang Chi-chen, Kuomintang lawmakers Liao Wei-hsiang, Yang Chiung-ying, Luo Ting-wei, and Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers Tsai Chi-chang, Ho Hsin-chun, and other industry representatives were all there.</p>
            <p>During his speech at the meeting, Premier Cho said that after the United States announced equal tariffs, Taiwan's tariffs have gone down from 32% to 20%. Although Taiwan did not experience the 32% period, it now faces 20% instead of the original 10%.</p>
            <p>He said that to help businesses quickly adapt to these changes, the government proposed a special law for economic, social, and national security resilience. This law will help Taiwan deal with global changes. Today, the government council passed the draft of this revised law. It will increase the budget from the original NT$410 billion to NT$590 billion, after being revised by the Legislative Yuan from NT$545 billion. This money will be used in two parts.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said he hopes the new law will be finished quickly, just like the special law for rebuilding after Typhoon Danas and the heavy rain on July 28. He hopes Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu will help this happen. Then, the government can use the money from the law. For supporting industries, he hopes the subsidies will have wide and real benefits.</p>
            <p>Talking about the tariff talks, Premier Cho said the government will never aim for 20% in their talks. Taiwan has strong economy, high-tech industries, and small and medium-sized businesses to support it. Taiwan is strong enough to get fairer treatment. They will keep working hard on this. They hope to lower tariffs and not add them to existing ones.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that current global tariff talks are a fresh start for world trade rules. In the future, the government and industries will need to get used to the new trade rules after tariffs. The US adjusting its equal tariffs affects all countries. The government needs to offer more support plans for different industries.</p>
            <p>Regarding America's plan to bring back manufacturing, Premier Cho said Taiwan can use its experience to help the US and the world improve. When the US needs more manufacturing, Taiwan is willing to work more together. This makes the talks more complex. The government hopes to reach an agreement first, and then discuss conditions to remove the added tariffs.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said the government is now actively understanding how much each industry is affected. Only then can they offer support plans. He hopes the Legislative Yuan will quickly support the special budget and the revised law. This will allow the money to be used soon, so they can support industries earlier.</p>
            <p>Zhuang Dali, the head of the Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry, told reporters that the machinery industry's ability to compete is affected by tariffs and exchange rates. He hopes the government can speed up support measures. He also hopes they can make the application process easier and approve things quickly. This will truly help the industry.</p>

            <h1>Alishan Forest Recreation Area Clears Fallen Trees, Expected to Reopen on August 15</h1>
            <p>Due to Typhoon Yangliu, the Alishan National Forest Recreation Area had many fallen trees and dead leaves. This made the walking paths impossible to use. Today, workers cleaned the area and checked the park. The main paths for tourists are now clear. The park is expected to open again tomorrow at 8 AM.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency announced today that besides the Alishan National Forest Recreation Area opening tomorrow, other paths managed by their Chiayi branch will open later. They will check the conditions at each site first. For the latest information on when parks and paths are open, people can check the Taiwan Forest Recreation website.</p>
            <p>The Alishan Forest Railway and Cultural Heritage Office also announced that the Alishan Forest Railway did not have serious damage. Today, they finished cleaning and checking the tracks. They also ran test trains.</p>
            <p>The main line of the Alishan Forest Railway, from Chiayi to Alishan, will start running normally again tomorrow. The Zhaoping and Sacred Tree branch lines, which are inside the Alishan National Forest Recreation Area, will start running at 9 AM when the park opens. The Zhushan line will start running again on August 16, early in the morning.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi branch of the Forestry Agency reminds people that after many days of rain, the soil in the mountains still holds a lot of water. This means rocks can fall or landslides can happen easily. They ask visitors to avoid mountain paths for now and to be careful.</p>
