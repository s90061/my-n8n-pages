The pandemic forced many to re-evaluate their relationship with work. Burnout became rampant, and people started questioning the hustle culture that had dominated the previous decades. Now, a new trend called "quiet quitting" is gaining traction, especially among younger workers.

Quiet quitting doesn't mean actually quitting your job. Instead, it involves doing exactly what your job description entails and nothing more. Employees who are quiet quitting are not actively disengaged, but they are setting boundaries and refusing to go above and beyond without proper compensation or recognition. They're logging off on time, not checking emails after hours, and declining extra projects that aren't part of their core responsibilities.

Some experts see quiet quitting as a healthy way to prevent burnout and regain control over one's work-life balance. Others worry that it could lead to decreased productivity and a negative impact on career advancement. However, many quiet quitters argue that they are simply doing their jobs effectively and efficiently, while prioritizing their well-being and personal lives. They believe that companies should focus on rewarding employees for their core contributions, rather than expecting them to constantly overwork themselves. Ultimately, the rise of quiet quitting is sparking important conversations about workplace expectations, employee value, and the evolving definition of success.

**Article 2: New Zealand Reopens Borders to Boost Tourism**

After more than two years of strict border controls, New Zealand has fully reopened its borders to international visitors. The move is aimed at revitalizing the country's tourism industry, which has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The reopening comes as New Zealand experiences a resurgence in tourism, with many visitors eager to explore its stunning landscapes and unique culture. Tourists are now able to enter the country without needing to quarantine, provided they meet the necessary vaccination requirements. The government is hoping the relaxation of border rules will encourage more people to visit during the peak summer season.

Tourism contributes significantly to New Zealand's economy, and the government has implemented several initiatives to support the industry's recovery. These include marketing campaigns aimed at attracting tourists from key markets, as well as funding for tourism businesses to adapt to the new environment. While the return of international visitors is expected to provide a much-needed boost, the industry is also focusing on sustainable tourism practices to ensure its long-term viability and protect New Zealand's natural beauty.

**Article 3: Scientists Develop Edible Coating to Extend Shelf Life of Fruits**

Researchers have created a revolutionary edible coating that can significantly extend the shelf life of fruits. The coating, made from plant-based materials, acts as a barrier against oxygen and moisture, slowing down the ripening process and preventing spoilage.

This innovation has the potential to reduce food waste dramatically, as fruits often spoil quickly after being harvested. The coating is applied by dipping or spraying the fruit, and it is completely safe to eat. It is also tasteless and odorless, so it doesn't affect the flavor or appearance of the fruit.

The edible coating is currently being tested on a variety of fruits, including berries, apples, and avocados, with promising results. Scientists believe that this technology could revolutionize the food industry, making it possible to transport and store fresh produce for longer periods of time. This would not only benefit consumers by providing access to fresher, higher-quality fruits, but also reduce the environmental impact of food waste. Furthermore, it could help farmers in developing countries to get their produce to market without it spoiling, improving their livelihoods and boosting food security.
