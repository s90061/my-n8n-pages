            <p>In New York, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September went up by 62 cents. It is now $63.42 for one barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price of Brent crude oil for October went up by 75 cents. It is now $66.6 for one barrel.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Zelenskyy meet happily, plan to call Putin after talks to push for peace.</h1>
            <p>News from Washington, August 18 (CNA). Today, US President Trump welcomed Ukraine's President Zelenskyy to the White House for talks. When reporters asked questions, Trump said Zelenskyy looked good in his black suit. Trump also repeated his ideas on ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. He plans to call Russian President Putin after the meeting.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that when a reporter asked Trump what he wanted to say to the people of Ukraine after shaking hands with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump said, "We love them."</p>
            <p>He also praised Zelenskyy's nice black coat. In late February this year, when Zelenskyy visited the White House, some right-wing news said bad things about him for not wearing a suit. At that time, he and Trump had an argument and ended the meeting unhappily.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Brian Glenn, the reporter who questioned Zelenskyy about not wearing a suit then, told him today, "You look good in that suit."</p>
            <p>Trump quickly said, "I said the same thing." Zelenskyy then told Glenn, "You are still wearing the same suit. I changed, but you did not."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Trump told the reporters about the Russia-Ukraine war, saying, "I like the idea of a ceasefire."</p>
            <p>But he also said, "We can work towards a peace agreement while they are still fighting." He noted that some recent peace agreements were made even when the fighting countries had not stopped fighting yet.</p>
            <p>Trump said that after his talks today with Zelenskyy and leaders from several European countries, he will call Russian President Vladimir Putin. He had met Putin in Alaska three days before.</p>
