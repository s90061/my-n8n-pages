The Norwegian Nobel Committee stated today that Narges Mohammadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023, has received death threats from authorities in Tehran. Mohammadi is an Iranian activist who fights for human and women's rights.

Mohammadi, who is 53 years old and has spent most of the last ten years in prison, was allowed to leave Evin Prison in Tehran for medical reasons for a short time last December. Her lawyers had warned that she could be arrested again at any time.

Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in a statement that Mohammadi called him to say her life was in danger. He stated that the government's agents have directly and indirectly threatened to "physically eliminate" her. The threats clearly show that her safety is at risk unless she stops all public activities in Iran and any international work or media appearances that support democracy, human rights, and free speech.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee also said they are very worried about the threats against Mohammadi and all people who disagree with the government in Iran. They asked the authorities to protect their lives and their freedom to speak. Mohammadi received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023 because she fought against the oppression of women in Iran and worked to promote human rights and freedom for everyone.

**Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's Wealth Growing Fast, Could Soon Be More Than Warren Buffett's**

Nvidia, a top company for AI computer chips, has seen its stock price go up, making its value more than 4 trillion US dollars. This has also made its co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, much richer. He might soon have more money than famous investor Warren Buffett.

According to Bloomberg on July 9th, Huang, who is 63, has gained 27.6 billion US dollars this year, making his total wealth 142 billion US dollars. This is very close to Warren Buffett's 144 billion US dollars. Most of Huang's money comes from the 3.5% of Nvidia shares he owns. Nvidia is now the company with the highest market value in the world.

On July 9th, Nvidia's value briefly reached 4 trillion US dollars, being the first company to do so. Its stock has gone up by about 22% this year. Nvidia's computer chips are very important for many major AI companies. Forbes magazine stated that an analyst from Loop Capital thinks Nvidia's value could reach almost 6 trillion US dollars. Because Nvidia is growing so quickly, Jensen Huang might soon be richer than Warren Buffett globally.

**Presidential Office Clarifies: President Reminded Military Not to Enter Private Homes, Not Refusing Aid**

Reports in the media said that President Lai Ching-te told people affected by the typhoon, "You can't rely on the military for everything," when they asked for help cleaning their damaged homes. However, the Presidential Office spokesperson, Kuo Ya-hui, explained that the President was actually reminding everyone that military rules do not allow soldiers to go inside private houses.

Kuo said the news report was wrong and unfair to the military, who have been working hard to help with disaster relief in places like Tainan. She explained that even while the military was doing their important "Han Kuang Exercise," they still sent soldiers to help clean up the typhoon damage. The President has thanked the military many times for their help.

The spokesperson said that the President's real message was to tell people that soldiers cannot go into private homes to clean, and that communities should also learn to solve problems themselves during natural disasters. The President also talked about the importance of all parts of society being strong against threats and disasters. He wants local governments and regular citizens to be able to help themselves and recover quickly after events like typhoons or earthquakes.
