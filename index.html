            <h1>New Taipei Aiwei Nursing Home Opens First Hospice Ward to Help People with Disabilities at the End of Life</h1>
            <p>The Aiwei Nursing Home in New Taipei City has opened a new hospice ward called "Xiaoming Xuan" today. The Social Welfare Department of the city government said this is the first time a nursing home in the country has set up a hospice ward. This will allow residents to finish their lives peacefully in a place they know, with their families next to them.</p>
            <p>Xu Xiu-neng, the Deputy Director of the Social Welfare Department, who attended the opening, said that Aiwei Nursing Home started in 1998. It takes care of people with severe mental and physical disabilities who cannot take care of themselves. Right now, there are over 160 residents, and their average age is almost 50 years old.</p>
            <p>Ms. Xu said in a press release that the city government supports setting up hospice wards in places for people with disabilities. This is because families need to be with their loved ones at the end of their lives. "Xiaoming Xuan" means light and faith. The hope is to "walk through the darkness and move towards eternal life."</p>
            <p>The hospice ward also works with the hospice team from MacKay Memorial Hospital in Tamsui to give full care. "Xiaoming Xuan" respects everyone's beliefs. It has decorations for Catholics and Christians, and also pictures of Buddha.</p>
            <p>The Social Welfare Department said that the hospice ward has large windows that look out at Taipei Port and Guanyin Mountain. It also uses essential oils and calming music to make the place feel warm. Auxiliary Bishop Chao Yung-chi from the Catholic Archdiocese of Taipei led the blessing ceremony for the opening.</p>
            <p>Zhao Jia-lun, the director of Yonghe Chensing Hospital, which is in charge of running Aiwei Nursing Home for the city government, said this is the first example of hospice care for people with disabilities. They will work with the MacKay team to help patients and their families finish their last journey with love.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jia-fang, the CEO of the Hospice Care Foundation, said that this year is the 35th anniversary of the foundation. Caring for people with disabilities is harder than long-term care. She said that every caregiver in the hospice ward is "like an angel."</p>
            <p>Jian Mei-ting, the director of the nursing home, added that 28 residents have signed papers to refuse emergency care, and 8 have made plans for their future medical care. They have also held memorial services and tree burials for residents who had no family. This shows their idea of "making love their home."</p>
