        const text = `**Longest Military Exercise Starts on July 9th: Taiwan Will Practice Defense from Beaches to Cities.**

The Han Kuang No. 41 military exercise will start tomorrow and last until July 18th. This year, the exercise will be longer, lasting 10 days and 9 nights. It will be continuous, without a set plan. The drills will move from defending beaches to defending cities. The goal is to make Taiwan's defense stronger and check if all military units are ready to fight.

Also, like last year, there will be no 'enemy' forces this year. To help units know their defense areas and war plans better, many drills will be done fully. So, people will see more soldiers on the streets.

The Han Kuang No. 41 is a big annual military exercise. It will happen from tomorrow until the 18th. Usually, it lasts 5 days and 4 nights. But this year, because of serious threats, it will be 10 days and 9 nights. It will be continuous and without a script. This makes it the longest Han Kuang exercise ever.

**Zhuang Jing-cheng Leaves Government Job to Support Recall Movement as a Volunteer.**

Zhuang Jing-cheng, who was the head of the Executive Yuan's Central Office, said today he is quitting. This is because the office's money was cut by the Parliament this year, and it might stop working. He decided to leave his job and become a citizen volunteer. He will go to the streets to fully support the recall movement.

Zhuang Jing-cheng used to be a lawmaker. Last year, he lost his election in Taichung. After that, he became the head of the Central Office. He said in a press release today that the money for the office was cut by lawmakers from different parties. They had about 7 million New Taiwan Dollars, but now they only have about 70,000 for work.

Zhuang Jing-cheng said that because the Parliament cut the budget, the office has almost no money. It cannot work properly. Things like electricity, water, gas, office supplies, cleaning, and staff salaries might stop. This could affect how the government helps different cities and how they deal with public complaints.
