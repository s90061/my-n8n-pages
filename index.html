            <h1>Taichung Rain Breaks 13-Year Record; 14 Dakeng Hiking Trails Damaged and Closed</h1>
            <p>Strong rain from the southwest has caused heavy rainfall in Taichung City. The amount of rain on that day was the highest in 13 years. In the Dakeng Scenic Area, 14 mountain hiking trails have been damaged in many places. The paths themselves are broken, and roads connecting to them have fallen apart. Because of this, the Taichung City Government announced that all 14 trails are now closed.</p>
            <p>Due to several days of heavy rain, the 14 mountain hiking trails in Taichung City's Dakeng Scenic Area have suffered a lot of damage. This includes broken trail facilities and collapsed roads leading to the trails. The Taichung City Government's Scenic Area Management Office said today in a press release that a first check of the damage shows there is no power at the exercise area on Trail No. 1. Also, Trails No. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 have many places where dirt and rocks have slid down hillsides and trail facilities are broken.</p>
            <p>Thinking about safety for hikers and how the ground is not stable after the disaster, the Taichung City Government announced on July 31st that all 14 Dakeng trails are closed. They ask people not to go hiking in the Dakeng mountains for now to stay safe. Later, they will give new information about when the trails will open again, depending on how fast the repairs are done.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Civil Affairs Bureau said earlier that the amount of rain on July 31st in Taichung City was the highest in 13 years. As of 3 PM on August 3rd, the Taichung City Government's emergency center had received 5 reports. These reports were about landslides, falling rocks, or damaged water systems on hillsides and farm roads in areas like Beitun District, Fengyuan District, Wufeng District, and Dongshi District. Workers have been sent to check these places and machines are being used to clear the farm roads. One house in Wuxi District had some water inside, but the water has now gone away.</p>
            <p>For several days, there has been rain, causing dirt and rocks to fall and roads to collapse. The Construction Bureau has been working hard to fix these issues. Most city roads that the Construction Bureau takes care of have been quickly opened for use, and they continue to clear dirt and rocks from the road. However, one bridge, Dahu Bridge on Zhucun Road in Taiping District, is closed because the ground under it collapsed, showing the bridge support.</p>

            <h1>Issei Takahashi Comes to Taiwan to Promote New Film, Says His Happiness Score is One Hundred</h1>
            <p>Japanese actor Takahashi Issei has come to Taiwan to promote his new movie. The film talks about family, happiness, fate, and love. He is thankful that the role he played helped him grow. He feels very happy now. He said, "Just being alive right now makes me happy, so my happiness score is one hundred."</p>
            <p>Today, Takahashi Issei and director Kazutaka Watanabe were at the press conference to promote their new movie, "Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe: Confessional." Kazutaka Watanabe said the movie was filmed in Italy. He explained that Italy has many world heritage sites, which are bright and beautiful, but it also has dark and shadowy places. The movie uses ideas from the Black Death in a big way.</p>
            <p>Takahashi Issei said that the movie tries many new things. He explained, "We did not change the original story, but we added some new parts. We connected them perfectly. In this movie, you can see the world of the story and a new chapter."</p>
            <p>In 2023, Takahashi Issei played Rohan Kishibe in "Rohan at the Louvre." Now, in "Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe: Confessional," he plays the same character again. He will go into a dark confessional room, facing the deepest secrets and bad things inside people's hearts. This shows the character's stronger feelings and very strong presence.</p>
            <p>Takahashi Issei thanked the people of Taiwan for their support. He said, "After the screening, at the discussion, I saw that Taiwanese viewers gave a lot of good energy and love. They liked my work so much that they almost wanted to grab me and say, 'I really love your work!'"</p>
            <p>Takahashi Issei shared that playing this role has almost changed his whole life. He said, "When I was 18, I was very confused. I didn't know what kind of person I wanted to be. But then I found this role, and it made me start thinking. Should I become the person society expects me to be? I like how the character believes strongly in what he pursues, and he doesn't care if people call him strange. I want to go after what I like, and I don't need to care what others think."</p>
            <p>Takahashi Issei openly said that after he started working, he met many fake and untrue things. He said, "In this character, I found his truth. I also want to find my own truth."</p>
            <p>This movie talks about happiness. Takahashi Issei said he has always been happy. But he also started to think, "If happiness continues all the time, it will feel very normal, like being in hell. You should experience some sadness, a little worry, and problems to truly feel the sweet taste of happiness."</p>
            <p>When asked about his happiness score now, he smiled and said, "Just being alive now is happiness. Actually, my happiness score always changes. Right now, I can say my happiness score is one hundred."</p>

            <p>The Shei-Pa National Park Administration said that Miaoli mountains have had heavy rain for several days. This morning, a more serious landslide happened at the 8-kilometer mark, so cars cannot pass. They have told the company with an open contract to start repairs. They expect the road to be clear on August 4th.</p>
            <p>The Shei-Pa National Park Administration also said that the rain for many days has caused many rocks to fall and trees to come down along the Simaxian Forest Road.
