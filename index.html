The Ministry of Education in Taiwan has updated its list of approved universities and colleges in mainland China. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been removed from this list. The list now includes 154 universities and 191 colleges.
Minister of Education Cheng Ying-Yao said earlier this year that schools controlled by China's United Front Work Department have political goals, not academic ones. He stated it is important to stop working with them, and Taiwan will no longer recognize their degrees.
The Ministry explained that Guangzhou Jinan University has been managed by China's United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic setting without political goals, the university was taken off the list.
The Ministry also repeated that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair and respectful. Schools should follow Taiwan's rules when students go to China for activities. They should be careful about invitations from China and check if the events have political aims. They should also avoid being hosted by China or helping with its political messages.
Additionally, the Ministry said that if schools are unsure about an event or its organizers, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for help. They still want to help young people from Taiwan and China learn together and understand each other. However, students should be aware of risks and check the background of event organizers to avoid political intentions.

**Video: First Car Fire on Kinmen Bridge - Surveillance Shows Car Quickly Becoming a Ball of Fire**

The first car fire happened on Kinmen Bridge today at 2:16 PM. A small car crashed and caught fire. It seems a tire burst, making the car slide and hit the island in the middle of the bridge. The two people in the car, including the driver Mr. Lin, got out safely and were not hurt. Firefighters arrived quickly and stopped traffic. They put out the fire fast. The car was completely burned. Police are looking into what caused the accident.
The Kinmen County Fire Department received a report at 2:10 PM about a car on fire near the Lake Xia end of Kinmen Bridge. The car was stuck on the divider and burning. Four fire trucks and 12 firefighters were sent to the scene, led by Battalion Chief Dong Bi-wen.
When rescuers arrived, the car was on fire on the divider, but the driver and passenger had already gotten out. Firefighters used two hoses to put out the fire quickly and cool down the car to prevent it from restarting. The car was a total loss, but luckily no one was injured.
Police found that Mr. Lin was driving towards Lieyu on Kinmen Bridge. About 1 kilometer into the drive, he heard a tire burst. The car then slid, hit the divider, and caught fire for an unknown reason. Police checked the driver for alcohol, and he was clear. The exact cause is still being investigated.
After the accident, police first allowed traffic to go in one direction at a time. Then, the car was moved, and environmental workers cleaned up oil and debris. The road was reopened for two-way traffic after cleaning.
The Fire Department advises drivers to always check their car and keep a safe distance from other cars. If there's a car accident or fire, call 119 right away and explain what happened and if anyone is hurt. This helps get help faster.
The Kinmen Police also remind drivers that if a tire bursts, do not suddenly brake. Instead, take your foot off the gas to slow down and hold the steering wheel steady. Turn on your hazard lights and steer to the side of the road. If you can't control the car, you can gently rub against a guardrail to slow down and avoid flipping over. If your car stops on the side of the road after an accident, follow seven steps to keep people and the car safe. Especially at night or when it's hard to see, place your warning triangle further away to warn other drivers.

**"Too Scared to Cry": Chinese Spouse Xiaowei Returns to Guizhou, Says She's Afraid After Late-Night Threatening Call**

Xiaowei, a Chinese spouse, had her stay permit in Taiwan cancelled because she talked about "unifying by force" on Douyin. She was sent back to Guizhou, China, in April. After returning, Xiaowei started sharing about life in the countryside. But she kept speaking her mind. She made a video saying the village leader in Guanzhou Town's Xinchang Village was not doing his job. She complained she hadn't received money for her land flooded by a dam. Now, she says she got a scary phone call from the Chinese police late at night. She said, "I'm really scared, so scared I can't even cry."
Today, Xiaowei posted a video on Douyin saying she is very scared. She said she is a farmer, a common person, and a good citizen who has not broken any laws. She just asked the village committee why they hadn't given her the compensation money. Then, at about 12 AM on June 28, she received a threatening call from the Guanzhou police station.
In the video, Xiaowei stated that she is a good farmer and cannot handle being scared. She questioned why the police station called her to warn her, asking, "Is there still justice? Is there still fairness?" She angrily asked the Chinese police, "Is it wrong for me to protect my rights legally? How do you people work at the police station and enforce laws? Is this how you treat farmers? Calling to show off your power."
Xiaowei said she is truly scared, so scared that she cannot cry. At the end of the video, she asked for help, "Please, relevant departments, protect us farmers. The more I think about it, the more scared I get. We farmers have no powerful connections, so we can only use the internet to ask for justice. Please pay attention."
