            <h1>MAC: China Takes Recall Seriously</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Lu Chia-jung, Taipei, July 24) Taiwan's recall vote will happen on July 26. On July 23, Taipei City Democratic Progressive Party councilor Hong Chien-yi said that a unit in Dongguan, China, offered cheap flight tickets. These tickets were to encourage Taiwanese businesspeople and their families to return to Taiwan before the recall vote. Liang Wen-chieh, the spokesperson for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said today that getting these businesspeople to come back might not have a big effect. However, it shows that China is taking this big recall vote very seriously. Their effort is as strong as for a presidential election.</p>
            <p>The MAC held its regular press conference today. Liang Wen-chieh answered questions about this issue. He said that the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) has checked with related groups. It seems that staff from the Dongguan Taiwanese Business Association sent this message under the association's name. They are still checking for more information about why this happened.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-chieh said the timing is very special, just a few days before the big recall vote. In the past, special offers like these usually happened because of presidential elections. This year is different. Before, there were no special offers for returning to Taiwan during summer. This is the first time.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-chieh said that not only in Dongguan, but also other Chinese government offices for Taiwan have asked local Taiwanese business associations to get businesspeople to come back to vote. However, this action might not have a big effect. China's efforts are as strong as during presidential elections. We can see this from their news, articles in important media, several press conferences by China's Taiwan Affairs Office, and now this action by local offices. They are clearly taking this recall vote very seriously.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-chieh said strongly that recall votes are Taiwan's own business. It is up to the people to decide who should be recalled and who should not. China should not get involved.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien-chen Comes Back to Beat Former India's Top Player, Reaches China Open Men's Singles Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Li Chien-chung, Taipei, July 24) Taiwan's top badminton player, Chou Tien-chen, won today in the Round of 16 at the BWF China Open. He lost the first game 18-21 but then won the next two games 21-15 and 21-8. He beat Prannoy H. S. from India. Chou Tien-chen is the only Taiwanese player to reach the men's singles quarterfinals.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen is 35 years old. His opponent, Prannoy H. S., is 33 years old and ranked 35th in the world. Before this match, they had played 13 times. Chou Tien-chen had won 7 matches and lost 6, so he had a slight lead.</p>
            <p>In the first game today, Chou Tien-chen was behind at the start. He caught up to 9-9, but then Prannoy scored 6 points in a row and got a big lead again. At the end of the game, Chou Tien-chen came back from 13-19 to 18-19, but he still lost the first game.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Chou Tien-chen started well and led 5-1. Then, both players played closely. But when the score was 13-13, Chou Tien-chen attacked more quickly. He scored 6 points in a row, which helped him win the game and make the score even.</p>
            <p>In the important third game, Chou Tien-chen was playing with confidence. He started with an 8-2 lead. Then, he kept getting more points. In the middle of the game, he had a big lead of 17-5. He easily won the third game and the match.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen told a Central News Agency reporter that he made too many mistakes in the first game. In the next two games, he tried hard to play better and play the way he wanted. He said, "I just told myself not to give up, no matter the score. I just needed to follow my plan and win one point at a time."</p>
            <p>After reaching the quarterfinals, Chou Tien-chen will play against Kunlavut Vitidsarn from Thailand, who is currently the world's top player. They have played 5 times before. Chou Tien-chen has won 3 times and lost 2 times. The last time they played was in June this year at the Indonesia Open, where Chou Tien-chen won in two straight games.</p>
            <p>Besides Chou Tien-chen, other Taiwanese male singles players also competed. Lin Chun-yi, a powerful left-handed player, fought hard for 1.5 hours against Anders Antonsen from Denmark. But he lost 19-21, 22-20, 20-22. Lee Chia-hao also lost 1-2 to Wang Zhengxing from China.</p>

            <h1>China's Solar Industry: Silicon Wafer Prices Rise Sharply Due to 'Anti-Involution' Effect</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 24) The Chinese government has tried to stop too much competition in the solar power industry. Companies are making less, so they are not fighting on prices. Because of this, the prices of silicon materials and silicon wafers have stopped falling and are now rising quickly. However, some experts say that the main long-term problem for the solar market is not enough demand. This "anti-involution" effort cannot solve that.</p>
            <p>Reports from Chinese media, like Futures Daily and Times Finance, say that prices for polysilicon and other silicon materials, which are key parts for solar panels, went up a lot in July. This also made silicon wafer prices rise quickly.</p>
            <p>The reports say that since July, people expected the "anti-involution" policy to work. This made the market feel positive. Polysilicon futures prices went up first. Yesterday morning, the main futures contract went up to its highest limit again. It went above 50,000 Chinese Yuan (about 205,000 New Taiwan Dollars), which is a new high since it started trading. So far, polysilicon futures have risen for 5 weeks in a row. The total increase for the month is over 60%.</p>
            <p>The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association's Silicon Industry Branch said today that positive market feelings made silicon wafer prices go up this week. For supply, the price of polysilicon (the raw material) went up a lot. Silicon wafer companies generally raised their prices because their costs were higher. Also, their plan to make less at the start of the month worked, so there is a bit less supply in the market. For demand, battery makers who buy these products are now accepting orders at higher prices, so more orders are coming in.</p>
            <p>Before this, on July 18, the Silicon Industry Branch said that to fix the problem of supply and demand in the industry, companies at all levels have reduced how much they produce. The monthly operating rates for industrial silicon, polysilicon, and silicon wafers fell to new record lows: 41.9%, 38.6%, and 44.3% respectively.</p>
            <p>The report used information from InfoLink Consulting, a company that advises on renewable energy. It showed that by July 23, silicon wafer prices had gone up by more than 20% compared to the start of the month. News from the market says that leading companies gave new prices, and silicon wafer prices went up by 60% compared to the start of the month.</p>
            <p>About this, Li Xunlei, the chief economist at Zhongtai International, said that the market expects too much from "anti-involution." This "anti-involution" is different from the supply-side reforms 10 years ago. This time, it is part of building a unified national market. It uses market rules and legal ideas to manage the industry better. It helps older, less efficient factories close down in an orderly way. It also focuses on fair competition and market rules.</p>
            <p>Li Xunlei believes that this "anti-involution" is mainly to stop local governments from investing without thinking and to stop too many factories from being built. But he says that not enough demand is a long-term problem with the way the industry is built. He thinks "anti-involution" cannot solve this.</p>
            <p>The Silicon Industry Branch also said that even though polysilicon prices have gone up now, the basic reasons for this are weak. The real situation of supply and demand has not improved much. For a short time, silicon material prices will continue to go up in small, changing amounts. The prices will truly become strong when some silicon wafer companies are forced to stop or reduce production because their raw material costs are too high and the prices they can get are too low.</p>
