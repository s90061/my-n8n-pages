UK inflation has fallen dramatically, surprising economists with its speed. The consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 3.9% in November, a significant decrease from 4.7% the previous month. This positive news suggests that the Bank of England's efforts to control rising prices are beginning to have an effect.

The fall in inflation is largely attributed to lower fuel prices and a slowdown in food price increases. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, also decreased, indicating a more widespread cooling of the economy. This provides some relief for households struggling with the cost of living crisis. The figures will likely fuel debate about when the Bank of England might start cutting interest rates. Many businesses are hoping for lower borrowing costs to boost investment and growth.

**Article 2: Innovation - New AI Tool Helps Doctors Diagnose Rare Diseases**

A team of researchers has developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can significantly speed up the diagnosis of rare diseases. These conditions often take years to diagnose, leaving patients and their families in a state of uncertainty. The AI works by analyzing patient symptoms and medical history, comparing them to a vast database of rare disease information.

The tool has shown promising results in initial trials, accurately identifying rare conditions more quickly than traditional diagnostic methods. The AI can also highlight potential genetic links, helping doctors to target specific genetic tests. While the AI is not intended to replace doctors, it can serve as a valuable aid in the diagnostic process, especially for rare and complex cases. The developers hope that this technology will lead to earlier diagnoses and improved treatment outcomes for patients with rare diseases.
