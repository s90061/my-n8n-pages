            <h1>Taichung Motorcyclist Beats Bus Driver After Overtaking Incident, Faces Charges</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a man named Chen was riding his motorcycle and had a problem with a Ubus company bus in Taichung. He followed the bus to the Taichung Train Station bus stop. There, he stopped the bus driver, Mr. Lin, and hit him, causing injuries, then left. Today, Mr. Chen came to the police station and said he was angry because he couldn't overtake the bus easily. The police have sent his case to court for charges like causing injury.</p>
            <p>The Third Precinct of Taichung City Police Department said today that at 9:02 PM yesterday, they received a report. A bus driver was hit by a man at the Taichung Train Station bus stop. Police officers were sent to the scene right away.</p>
            <p>When the police arrived, they learned about the situation. Mr. Lin, the 29-year-old Ubus driver, told the police that he was stopped at a red light near Taiwan Boulevard and Xingzhong Street in the Central District. A stranger stopped him and hit his car window. The stranger said that Mr. Lin was blocking his way.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin did not pay attention to the man. But the man followed the bus to the Taichung Train Station bus stop. Then, the man suddenly hit the bus's side mirror with his helmet and hit Mr. Lin with his hands. This broke the side mirror, and Mr. Lin had scratches on his neck and a broken arm. When the police arrived, the fight had stopped. They first helped Mr. Lin go to the hospital. After getting treatment, Mr. Lin went to the police station to make a report.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen came to explain himself this afternoon. He told the police that he was unhappy because he couldn't overtake the bus easily while riding. So, he followed the bus to the Taichung Train Station bus stop to argue, and then he committed the crime. After the police questioned him, Mr. Chen was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office for investigation based on charges of injury and damage under the criminal law.</p>

            <h1>Dragons Team's New Foreign Pitcher Ready to Start, Old Pitchers' Futures Unclear</h1>
            <p>The Weichuan Dragons baseball team in the Chinese Professional Baseball League has a new foreign pitcher. His name is not officially announced yet, but he has joined the team for training. Head coach Yeh Chun-Chang said the new pitcher is planned to be a starter. He throws fast and with power. When it comes to choosing other foreign pitchers, it seems that Long Sheng and Ai Long are not playing as well right now.</p>
            <p>The Dragons' new foreign pitcher has arrived in Taiwan and joined the team. The team only said he is a right-handed pitcher who has been playing games regularly, but they have not officially shared his name. Dragons' head coach Yeh Chun-Chang said before today's game that the new foreign pitcher has joined the team. He did some easy training yesterday. He has been staying in game shape, so he should not have big problems when he starts playing in real games. The team is just waiting for his documents to be ready.</p>
            <p>Coach Yeh said they still need to watch the new pitcher's performance. The current plan is for him to pitch one game in the minor league first. After that, he will have a chance to play in the major league. Unless the new pitcher plays very badly, he should be able to join the major league team.</p>
            <p>When asked about the new pitcher's style, Coach Yeh said the team needs a starting pitcher right now. The new pitcher throws about 150 kilometers per hour. He has good speed and power. But it's hard to talk about his control because he is in a new place. Sometimes it's hard to be exact. He is a pitcher with good skills.</p>
            <p>The deadline for foreign players in the Chinese Professional Baseball League is August 31st. About choosing which foreign players to keep, Coach Yeh said it seems Tyler Eppler and Andrew Gagnon will not be changed. The other two, Zac Lowther and Aaron Leasher, might be moved.</p>
            <p>Coach Yeh said that if Aaron Leasher wants to be a starter, he might not be able to throw enough pitches. His performance is also not very good. Zac Lowther is also not very steady; he plays well in one game and not well in another. So, it's hard to know what to expect from him. The coaches have an idea of what they want to do, but they still need to observe them.</p>
