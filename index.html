Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing many types of jobs, not just those in factories. Recently, AI has begun to affect creative jobs like writing, art, and music, which many people thought were safe. Some people are worried they might lose their jobs to AI. Others believe that AI will become a useful tool that helps humans do their work better.

Companies are using AI more and more to save money or to make their work faster and more efficient. For example, AI can write basic reports, create images, or even compose simple music. This means that workers need to learn new skills to work alongside AI. It's becoming important for people to understand how to use AI programs and manage them effectively.

Experts say that the future of work will involve people and AI working together. Instead of AI completely replacing humans, it will often take over repetitive tasks, allowing people to focus on more complex and creative parts of their jobs. Therefore, adapting to these new technologies and learning new skills will be key for workers in the coming years.

**New Study Links Human Activity to More Extreme Weather**

A new study has strongly confirmed that human activities are causing more extreme weather events around the world. The research shows a clear connection between the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere and a rise in unusually hot weather, heavy rain, and long dry periods. These types of weather events are happening more often and are becoming stronger than before.

For example, parts of Europe and Asia have seen very hot summers, while other regions have experienced record-breaking floods. These changes affect people's daily lives in many ways. Farmers struggle with harvests, cities face water shortages, and health services deal with more heat-related illnesses. The study highlights that these events are not natural variations but are directly influenced by how we live and produce energy.

Scientists emphasize that it's important to prepare for these changes and to reduce our carbon emissions. Adapting to more difficult weather, such as building stronger defenses against floods or developing crops that can survive drought, will be necessary. At the same time, efforts to use cleaner energy and reduce pollution are crucial to slow down global warming and its impacts on our planet.

**Popular Tourist Spots Take Action Against Too Many Visitors**

Many of the world's most popular tourist destinations are facing a problem called "overtourism." This happens when too many visitors arrive, which can harm the environment, make daily life difficult for local residents, and change the unique character of a place. From famous cities to beautiful natural sites, communities are struggling to manage the huge number of tourists.

In response, some places are now putting new rules in place. For instance, Venice, Italy, has started charging a small fee for day-trippers to enter the city on busy days. Amsterdam is making efforts to reduce the number of party tourists. Japan has also introduced new limits on the number of climbers allowed on Mount Fuji each day to protect the mountain and improve the climbing experience.

These measures aim to protect local culture, natural beauty, and the quality of life for residents. The goal is not to stop tourism completely, but to make it more sustainable and respectful. Many destinations hope that by managing visitor numbers and encouraging different types of tourism, they can keep their unique charm for both locals and future visitors.`;
