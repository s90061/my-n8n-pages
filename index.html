            <h1>New York Tourist Bus Crash Kills 5, Many Injured; Passengers Include Chinese People</h1>
            <p>Authorities in the United States said that a tourist bus carrying 54 people crashed on a highway. The bus was returning to New York City from Niagara Falls. Five passengers died and many were injured. Many of the passengers were from India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the bus seemed to lose control when it was driving on Interstate 90 near Pembroke town, about 40 kilometers east of Buffalo. The windows broke, and passengers were thrown out of the bus.</p>
            <p>James Oâ€™Callaghan, a spokesperson for the New York State Police, said, "Right now, we know that many people died, many are stuck, and many are injured." He also said there were children on the bus.</p>
            <p>Oâ€™Callaghan said the bus was going east when it hit a road divider. It finally stopped in a ditch on the right side of the road. He mentioned that many passengers were Indian, Chinese, and Filipino.</p>
            <p>Oâ€™Callaghan also said, "The driver survived and is safe. We are working with him. We think we have some basic information about what happened and why the bus lost control." But he did not share more details.</p>
            <p>Mercy Flight, a medical transport service, said that three of its helicopters and three others from different groups took people from the crash site. Hospitals in the area said they checked or took care of more than 40 people. Patients had injuries like head injuries and broken arms and legs.</p>
            <p>Oâ€™Callaghan said, "This was a full-size tourist bus, and it was badly damaged. I guess most of the passengers were not wearing seatbelts. This is why so many people were thrown out of the bus."</p>
            <p>After a bus crash in New York in 2023, New York State law says that all buses made on or after November 28, 2016, must have seatbelts. It is not yet known how old the bus in today's crash was.</p>

            <h1>North Korea Says South Korea Fired Warning Shots at Border, Calls It Intentional Provocation</h1>
            <p>According to North Korea's state news agency (KCNA), North Korea said today that the South Korean military fired warning shots at the border between the two Koreas on August 19. North Korea said this action was done on purpose to cause trouble.</p>
            <p>North Korea also stated that the South Korean military is giving more and more warning messages through broadcasts in the border area.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that since last year, North Korea has been building fences along the heavily guarded border between the two Koreas. At the same time, it has been destroying roads and railways that connect the two countries.</p>
            <p>KCNA quoted a statement from Vice Chief of the General Staff, Ko Jong Chol. He said that if anything stops the fence-building plan, North Korea will "take steps to fight back." He also said that from now on, North Korea "will not be responsible for any serious problems" that happen in the border area if warnings are ignored.</p>
            <p>The message from North Korea is different from what South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said last week. Lee Jae Myung had said that South Korea would stop some military activities at the border. The South Korean government has been working to make relations better between the two Koreas recently.</p>

            <h1>Vietnam Starts Big "Simplification Revolution", Cuts 100,000 Government Jobs</h1>
            <p>Vietnam is making its biggest changes in almost 40 years. To Lam, the leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam, is leading a "simplification revolution." This means he is cutting down government levels and groups, and getting rid of 100,000 public service jobs. He hopes to use this chance to build a rising nation, and many countries are watching. Experts say that while there might be some difficult times and worries about too much power, if it works, it will make the government better and save money.</p>
            <p>In February this year, Vietnam's National Assembly approved a plan to combine provinces and cities. This started the biggest change in government structure in Vietnam's recent history. Experts call this the "simplification revolution," and it is the most ambitious change since the "Doi Moi" reforms in the 1980s.</p>
            <p>To Lam became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam last July. He promised to start a "new era for Vietnam to rise." Soon after, many plans for changes and new structures began.</p>
            <p><strong>Provinces Cut in Half, Government Becomes Simpler: Biggest Changes in 40 Years</strong></p>
            <p>To get ready for this new era, the large and slow government system needs to become more active. The goal is to make the government work better, speed up old, complicated administrative tasks, make the large number of workers smaller, cut costs, and reduce problems caused by too much bureaucracy.</p>
            <p>With a signal from To Lam, starting in July, Vietnam's original 63 provinces and cities officially combined into 34. This includes 28 provinces and 6 cities directly controlled by the central government, which is almost half. The local government system, which had three levels, was also simplified into two levels: provincial and communal. The old district level was removed.</p>
            <p>Professor Zach Abuza from the National War College in Washington told Radio Free Asia (RFA) that after the merging, almost every new province has a coast and a port, except for the northeastern inland provinces. This is good for international trade.</p>
            <p>In just a few months, many place names that people had used their whole lives disappeared from maps and official papers. This caused a lot of discussion online.</p>
            <p>Hieu, a resident of Hanoi whose hometown was in Ha Giang province in northern Vietnam, told CNA that his hometown merged with Tuyen Quang province to become the new Tuyen Quang province. He felt "a bit lost" because the name of his hometown was gone. But he also thought that simplifying government levels would make things more efficient. He said, "Even though it's not what I'm used to, it's good for the country in the long run."</p>
            <p>Besides combining local government levels, simplifying political groups is also key to To Lam's reforms. The number of top-level committees has decreased. Central ministries have also been reorganized, for example, the Ministry of Transport merged with the Ministry of Construction, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment merged with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Local departments are also being completely reorganized.</p>
            <p><strong>Nearly 100,000 Jobs Cut, Saved Money for Education</strong></p>
            <p>Making the government smaller can make it more efficient. But because of this, nearly 100,000 government jobs were cut. Many government workers either moved to new jobs, retired, or were fired.</p>
            <p>However, this is also one of the goals of the "simplification revolution." According to reports like Lianhe Zaobao, about 70% of Vietnam's government spending goes to civil servant salaries. Big spending, low pay, and low efficiency have been long-standing problems for Vietnam.</p>
            <p>These changes also mean new ways of managing money. The government will have more money to put into national development. To Lam sees "education" as a top priority.</p>
            <p>In a speech in May, he admitted that even though the economy is growing fast, there are still problems. These include "limited worker productivity and innovation ability" and the "risk of falling into a 'middle-income trap'."</p>
            <p>To take advantage of opportunities like a young workforce and benefits from the US-China trade war, Vietnam needs to act fast. It needs to improve its people's skills and change to new technologies. Also, to change its industries and stop skilled people from leaving the country, training in new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) is very important.</p>
            <p>In May, the government said it would not charge tuition fees for children from public kindergartens to high school graduation. It will also invest about 54 trillion Vietnamese dong (about 62.2 billion New Taiwan dollars) to support education reforms and train talented people.</p>
            <p>On August 21, the "Vietnam AI Academy" opened. It was organized by the Vietnam National Innovation Center (NIC), Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), and the tech giant NVIDIA. Vice Prime Minister Nguyen Chi Dung spoke at the opening. He said that this model should be copied all over Vietnam so that students, researchers, businesses, and government workers can all learn about AI.</p>
            <p><strong>Vietnam at a Turning Point: Chances and Problems in a Rising Era</strong></p>
            <p>Expert Zach Abuza said that Vietnam's young workforce is now at its largest. Because more people are moving to cities and more women with good education are working, the number of new babies will slowly go down. He believes Vietnam might look at Thailand as an example and try to avoid getting old as a country before it gets rich.</p>
            <p>Vietnam's economy is growing strongly in 2025. Data from Vietnam's General Statistics Office shows that in the first half of this year, the economy grew by about 7.52%. In the second quarter, it grew even more, by 7.96%. This is the fastest growth in Southeast Asia, 2 percentage points higher than the Philippines, which is second.</p>
            <p>Abuza explained that To Lam's anti-corruption work over the last 10 years has made him strong and influential in the party. He is using his new power to make big changes to the system faster than ever before.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam will be held next January. It is unusual for To Lam to make such big changes now. This shows that "he completely controls the Central Committee and has its full support," and that "he is very confident about being re-elected next year."</p>
            <p>But Abuza also thinks that To Lam is the right person for these important changes. He "truly understands that Vietnam must use this very short opportunity to make big economic and structural reforms."</p>
            <p>Nguyen Khac Giang, a researcher at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, wrote in an article called "Vietnam's Bureaucratic Reforms: Opportunities and Challenges in the 'Era of a Rising Nation'" that having "super ministries" could lead to too much central control. This might weaken the "balance of power," and there might be growing unhappiness within the party due to more competition.</p>
            <p>In his opinion, the success of these reforms will depend on balancing different things: fast changes with keeping stability, central control with local activity, cutting jobs with keeping public support. However, "if the reforms are done well, they will help Vietnam fight inefficiency and corruption, and move towards its goal of becoming a high-income economy by 2045."</p>
