            <h1>Argentina's Football Team to Play Friendly Match in India; Messi's Role Unsure</h1>
            <p>The Argentina Football Association announced today that the national team, led by star player Lionel Messi, will play a friendly match in November. This game will take place in Kerala, a state in southern India. However, it is not yet clear if Messi will play in the match.</p>
            <p>The plan for Argentina's men's football team to visit India has been in the works for some time. The government of Kerala has said many times that they are trying hard to invite Argentina to play a friendly game in India before the 2026 World Cup. But the exact date of the match has not been announced.</p>
            <p>However, a new statement from the Argentina Football Association says that the team, led by Messi, will have friendly matches at two different times later this year. First, they will play in the United States in October. Then, in November, they will play friendly games in Angola and India.</p>
            <p>If the Argentina men's football team's trip to India happens, it will be their first friendly match there since 2011.</p>
            <p>India Today reported that in 2011, Argentina played a friendly match against Venezuela in Kolkata, India. Messi also played in that game. His smooth playing style won the hearts of the 70,000 fans there. But this time, it is still not known if he will play.</p>
            <p>In early August, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that Messi and his team planned to travel around India. They would visit Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and New Delhi. They would also meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
            <p>Firstpost reported that the Argentina men's football team will go to the United States for friendly matches from October 6th to 14th. However, the cities they will visit and the teams they will play against are not yet known. From November 10th to 18th, they will play in Luanda, the capital of Angola, and in Kerala, India. Their opponents for these games are also not yet known.</p>

            <h1>Two Women in Xindian, New Taipei, Tore Up Referendum Ballots; Election Committee to Decide Punishment</h1>
            <p>An 84-year-old woman named Liu in Xindian District, New Taipei City, tore up her referendum ballot today because she made a mistake when marking it. Also, a 52-year-old woman named Chen tore up her ballot when she found she had received an extra one. Both cases have been sent to the New Taipei City Election Committee for penalties. By law, they could each be fined between 5,000 and 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Today was the day for voting on the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant restart referendum and the recall of seven KMT lawmakers. Around noon in Xindian District, New Taipei City, two incidents of people tearing up referendum ballots happened.</p>
            <p>The Xindian Police Department of New Taipei City Government explained that at 11:15 AM, the 84-year-old Ms. Liu was at a polling station on Baozhong Road. She marked her ballot incorrectly and, feeling nervous, tore it up.</p>
            <p>The police also said that at 12:37 PM, the 52-year-old Ms. Chen was at a polling station in Cukeng Village. When she was voting, she realized she had received an extra ballot. She got nervous and did not know what to do, so she tore up the ballot right there in the voting booth.</p>
            <p>The police stated that election workers at the polling stations found both cases and told the police. Election supervisors were also called to confirm what happened. Records were made at the scene according to Article 44 of the Referendum Act. The cases were then sent to the New Taipei City Election Committee for a decision on the penalty. Ms. Liu and Ms. Chen left on their own.</p>
            <p>According to Article 44 of the Referendum Act, anyone who puts something other than a referendum or election ballot into the ballot box, or purposely tears up a ballot they received, will be fined between 5,000 and 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Wind Power Doesn't Work; Rhode Island Wind Farm 80% Finished, Now Stopped</h1>
            <p>Today, the U.S. federal government ordered a large wind power farm off the coast of Rhode Island to stop all construction. The wind farm was already 80% finished. Orsted, a Danish company that makes renewable energy, might take legal action.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that this is the latest example of the Trump government stopping wind power projects. Yesterday, Trump also said that "wind power simply does not work." Wind power is seen as a clean energy source that helps the environment.</p>
            <p>Orsted said that the "Revolution Wind" project started last year after getting all the necessary permissions. Its goal is to provide electricity to over 350,000 homes in Rhode Island, USA.</p>
            <p>Matthew Giacona, the acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), sent a letter today. It ordered to "stop all current activities in the project" to allow time for a review.</p>
            <p>The letter said: "Specifically, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is trying to fix concerns related to protecting U.S. national security interests." It did not explain further. The letter also said, "You cannot continue construction until the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management finishes its review."</p>
            <p>Orsted said in a statement that they are looking at all ways to quickly solve this problem, including possibly taking legal steps.</p>
            <p>Orsted stated that the wind farm is 80% complete. Out of 65 planned wind turbines, 45 have already been installed. They hope to finish the entire project by the end of next year.</p>
            <p>Since Trump became president in January this year, taking over from former President Biden who supported renewable energy, the entire wind power industry in the U.S. has faced big problems.</p>
            <p>Trump has stopped federal approvals and loans for all wind power projects, both at sea and on land. He has also said many times that he does not like wind power. Yesterday in Washington, Trump said: "We will not do wind energy anymore, we will go back to fossil fuels."</p>
