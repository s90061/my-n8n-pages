The former mayor of Hemei, Ruan Hou-jue, has been sentenced to 9 years in prison. He was found guilty of taking bribes in a land case. The court in Changhua also took away his right to hold public office for 6 years. He must also give back over NT$12 million that he got illegally. He also got an 8-month sentence for not paying taxes.

Prosecutors found that Ruan Hou-jue, who was mayor from 2014 to 2022, helped illegally approve a land application. He got money for this help. This land deal had been stopped by law for 15 years. But with his help, it was approved in just 10 days, without the normal 30-day public notice. The land was then sold for NT$199 million in 2020.

To hide the money, Ruan Hou-jue told someone to send NT$3.63 million to his driver's bank account in October 2020. He also gave his driver cash and checks worth NT$8.45 million. In total, he received NT$12.08 million. He used some of this money for himself, put some in a safe at home, or bought stocks. He also did not pay income tax, which is called money laundering and breaking tax laws. The court said that Ruan Hou-jue was a mayor and earned money from the government. But he used his position to take bribes. This seriously hurt the image of honest public service. The judge said he also used ways to hide the money and avoid punishment, and he didn't pay taxes. So, he was sentenced to 9 years in prison and cannot hold public office for 6 years. He must also give back NT$12.08 million. He also got an 8-month sentence for tax evasion, which can be changed to a fine. He can still appeal the decision.

**Ex-FBI and CIA Bosses Under Investigation for Russia Probe Actions**

Fox News Digital reported today that the FBI has started a criminal investigation into John Brennan, the former head of the CIA, and James Comey, the former head of the FBI. The report says that both men are being investigated for doing wrong things during the government's earlier look into Russia's possible involvement in the 2016 U.S. election. This was known as the "Russia gate" case. In that election, Donald Trump won against Hillary Clinton.

It's not clear exactly what the investigation into Brennan and Comey covers. John Ratcliffe, who Trump chose to lead the CIA, has named Brennan as someone who might be charged. Brennan was the CIA head under former President Obama. Fox News Digital said its information came from the Department of Justice, but it did not say how many sources. Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, said she was happy to see the Department of Justice start this investigation. The two former officials have made Trump and his supporters angry for a long time because of their part in the Russia investigation.

In 2016, Comey's FBI started a criminal investigation into whether Trump's campaign worked with the Russian government to affect the election. Comey also publicly said that Trump was being investigated. Trump fired Comey soon after he became president in 2017. Later, Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, took over the investigation. Mueller did not find proof that Trump's 2016 campaign worked with Russia in a criminal way. In January 2017, a US intelligence report said that Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to influence the 2016 US election to help Trump. At that time, Brennan was leading the CIA. A CIA report released last week found some mistakes in how the 2017 report was prepared. But it did not disagree with the main findings.

**University Entrance Exams to Start July 11, Test Centers Cleaned After Typhoon**

The university entrance exams for the 2025 school year will happen on July 11th and 12th. The exam center said today that all test locations affected by Typhoon Danas have been cleaned. They will also clean and disinfect the test rooms again the day before the exams. This is to stop mosquitoes and prevent the spread of diseases.

Students can visit their test rooms and see their seats on July 10th, from 2 PM to 4 PM. However, at National Changhua University of Education in Changhua, students can view their test rooms from 4 PM to 6 PM because of another national exam. About 39,190 students will take this exam, which helps them get into university. Because Typhoon Danas just passed, many students and parents were worried about the condition of the test locations.

The exam center announced today that all schools used as test centers have been cleaned after the typhoon. Also, to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the flu, and to lower the risk of dengue fever, all test centers will be fully cleaned and disinfected the day before the exams, as usual. Students can feel safe taking their exams. The exam center also reminded students that according to the weather report, the weather on July 11th will still be unstable across Taiwan, with heavy rain in the central and southern parts. On July 12th, the weather will be more stable, but there might be afternoon thunderstorms. Students should bring umbrellas. If it doesn't rain, it will be hot, so they should drink enough water to avoid heatstroke.
