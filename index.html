            <h1>Huwei University and Quanta Work Together on "Art Market" Tour</h1>
            <p>Huwei University of Science and Technology is working with the Quanta Culture & Education Foundation. They are holding an art exhibition called "Joy in Art." The exhibition's theme is "Art Market: A Fun Look at Ancient Customs and Art for 1000 Years." It will travel to 12 schools in Yunlin County. This will let people see art from ancient Chinese markets all the way to modern everyday life in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Huwei University said today that the "Joy in Art" project is now in its 18th year. So far, it has held 177 exhibitions in Yunlin, and nearly 230,000 people have visited them. This year, the exhibition started at Huwei University today. Over the next year, it will go to 11 local elementary and middle schools. This helps make art education strong from a young age.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wu Wan-juan, an assistant manager at the Quanta Culture & Education Foundation, said this exhibition is different. It does not just teach about artists. Instead, it focuses on themes. The "Art Market" theme connects to children's daily lives through food, clothes, housing, transport, education, and entertainment. This helps them learn that everyday things and local businesses can be art. It also helps them understand their local culture better.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Ta-cheng, Vice President of Huwei University, said that art is not just for special people. It should be closer to daily life and people. He also said that a "market," which is the theme of this exhibition, is the best place to show what a city is really like. It also shows a small picture of human feelings and social changes.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Ta-cheng explained that the exhibition has four main areas: "Lively Market Opens," "Something New and Interesting Here," "Lanterns and Decorations for Festivals," and "Explore the Market for Treasures." There are 23 artworks, including rubbings of Han Dynasty market bricks, the famous painting "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" by Song Dynasty painter Zhang Zeduan, and "Market Entrance" by important modern Taiwanese painter Li Shih-chiao.</p>
            <p>The exhibition is at Huwei University, building 3, first floor, from today until September 29. After that, it will go to schools like Gukeng Elementary and Junior High, Jiaxing Elementary, Gongcheng Elementary, Yunlin Elementary, Feng'an Elementary, Douliu Elementary, Guangxing Elementary, Yuanzhang Elementary, Xinsheng Elementary, Zhongzheng Elementary, and Lunbei Elementary.</p>

            <h1>Flu-like Cases Go Over 100,000; CDC Says Flu Season May Start This Week</h1>
            <p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said today that the number of people visiting doctors for flu-like illnesses went over 100,000 last week. The total percentage of flu-like cases in emergency rooms and clinics reached 10.9%. The CDC thinks that the flu season will begin this week. However, the COVID-19 situation is still at a low level.</p>
            <p>Ms. Zeng Shu-hui, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Welfare's CDC, said in a regular report today that from September 7 to 13, there were 100,909 visits for flu-like illnesses. This is 10.4% more than the 90,000 visits in the week before. The number is rising. Also, the percentage of flu-like cases in emergency rooms and clinics reached 10.9% last week. The CDC expects this percentage to go over 11% this week, meaning the flu season will start.</p>
            <p>Ms. Zeng Shu-hui explained that in the 2022-2023 flu season, the number of cases went above the typical level in week 35. This year, it is expected to happen in week 38. In past years, the flu season often started after October, but in recent years, it has started earlier.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li Jia-lin, Deputy Director of the CDC's Epidemic Command Center, said that the recent rise in cases is likely because schools have started again and children are close to each other. In the past, there were also more cases before the new flu season began in October. However, the peak of the flu usually happens from December to the Lunar New Year. It is still unclear if the rise in cases in mid-to-late September will continue or go down. They will keep watching.</p>
            <p>Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Zeng Shu-hui said that after reaching a peak in late May and early June this year, the number of cases has been going down. It is currently staying at a low level.</p>
            <p>This year's flu and COVID-19 vaccines will be available in different stages starting October 1. Ms. Zeng Shu-hui noted that the plan for free COVID-19 vaccines has changed. Instead of giving them to everyone like in past years, they will now be given based on risk. There are three reasons for this change.</p>
            <p>Ms. Zeng Shu-hui explained that the first reason is that COVID-19 has changed. In the beginning, the virus caused more serious illness and deaths, so many people needed vaccines to get immunity. But as the virus changed, the death rate went down. The original Wuhan virus had a death rate of about 2% to 3%, the Alpha virus was about 2%, the Delta virus was about 1%, and now the Omicron virus is about 0.2%. The number of serious illnesses and deaths has dropped a lot.</p>
            <p>Ms. Zeng Shu-hui also said that the second reason is that many people have been infected or vaccinated in the past few years. So, the community's immunity is much higher than at the start of the pandemic. Giving many vaccines to people who are not at high risk is not as effective as before. Also, they are following what organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Union are doing. These organizations have also changed from giving vaccines to everyone to giving them to high-risk groups. So, after looking at the good and bad points of the vaccine, they made this change.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan National Chinese Orchestra Finishes Czech Tour, Thousands Enjoy Taiwan's Charm</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan National Chinese Orchestra, part of the National Center for Traditional Arts, toured the Czech Republic from September 9 to 15. They performed at the opening of a special exhibition at the National Palace Museum. They also held two concerts called "Taiwan Banquet" and organized an opera workshop and cultural talks. They brought Taiwan's traditional art to the Czech Republic, showing the lively spirit and warmth of Taiwanese culture.</p>
            <p>The "Sounds of Taiwan: Taiwan National Chinese Orchestra Czech Tour 2025" had over a thousand visitors. On September 11, the orchestra was invited to play at the opening of the "100 Treasures and Stories from the National Palace Museum" exhibition. They played songs like "Beehive Fireworks Festival," "Longing for the Spring Breeze," "Moonlight on the Lake," "Taiwanese Folk Song Medley," and "High Mountain Green." Their beautiful music showed Taiwan's folk festivals, mountains, and culture.</p>
            <p>For their encore, the Taiwan National Chinese Orchestra played "Goin' Home," the second movement from AntonÃ­n DvoÅ™Ã¡k's "New World Symphony," a Czech composer. The feelings of homesickness from Taiwan and the emotions from the Czech Republic came together in the music. Everyone clapped loudly for a long time, adding a special cultural moment to the opening ceremony.</p>
            <p>On September 12 and 13, the Taiwan National Chinese Orchestra performed the concert "Taiwan Banquet." The show was about a "daughter's wedding banquet," showing the whole process from getting married, cooking, to sending off the bride and the happy ending. The orchestra members acted as "kitchen helpers" in the show. In the "cooking" part, they brought everyday kitchen items like knives, cutting boards, woks, rice paddles, and big orange buckets onto the stage. They used these to make many different rhythmic sounds, turning the stage into a busy kitchen.</p>
            <p>The lively scene and deep family feelings reminded Taiwanese people living abroad of their homeland and the sadness of a daughter getting married. Many people cried, saying, "It felt just like being at a banquet back home." Fathers with daughters also said, "It felt like I was really there, experiencing the sadness of marrying off my daughter." For local people seeing it for the first time, it was a way to feel the lively spirit and warmth of Taiwanese culture through music and theater.</p>
            <p>Besides stage performances, the Taiwan National Chinese Orchestra also held a "Taiwanese Opera Workshop" and a talk titled "Taiwanese Banquet Culture and Chinese Orchestra Music." These events turned art into a way to connect, helping Czech audiences understand what Chinese orchestral music and folk culture mean.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan National Chinese Orchestra's tour in the Czech Republic showed the strong power of Chinese orchestral music and Taiwanese opera. It also brought together groups like the Ministry of Culture's "Cultural Wave Project," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the National Palace Museum. They successfully shared stories from Taiwan in the heart of Europe. This made the "Voice of Taiwan" heard loudly in Prague and strengthened the connection between Taiwan and the world.</p>
