            <h1>Air Canada Postpones Flight Recovery After Flight Attendants Refuse to End Strike</h1>
            <p>Air Canada has put off its plan to restart flights. This happened because the union for 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants said they would not go back to work. This strike has almost stopped the airline, messing up summer travel plans for many passengers around the world.</p>
            <p>According to news reports, the Canadian Industrial Relations Board, a government group, told the 10,000 striking flight attendants they must return to work by 2 PM local time today. Air Canada had said it would start flights again tonight.</p>
            <p>Air Canada released a statement. It said, "Air Canadaâ€¦ has put off its plan to slowly restart flights for Air Canada and Air Canada Rougeâ€¦ The airline will restart flights tomorrow night." This decision was made because the union for the striking flight attendants chose to continue the strike, even though the government told them to stop.</p>
            <p>Air Canada pointed out that the Canadian Industrial Relations Board had earlier "told Air Canada to start its operations again. It also told all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flight attendants to go back to their jobs before 2 PM on August 17, 2025."</p>
            <p>The strike by Air Canada flight crew began early in the morning on August 16. This happened after they said no to a new contract offer from the company.</p>
            <p>Air Canada flies directly to 180 cities around the world. The company thinks about 130,000 passengers are affected every day.</p>

            <h1>Spain Hit by 20 Major Wildfires, Government Sends 500 More Soldiers to Help</h1>
            <p>Today, August 17, twenty big wildfires are burning in different parts of Spain. Very hot weather is making it hard to fight the fires. Because of this, the government has sent 500 more soldiers to help put out the fires.</p>
            <p>News reports say that in Galicia, a region in northwest Spain, some wildfires have joined together, making even bigger fires. This has forced roads to close and train services to stop in that area.</p>
            <p>Southern Europe is having one of its worst wildfire seasons in 20 years, and Spain is one of the countries most affected. In just the last week, three people have died, and over 115,000 hectares of land have burned. Neighboring Portugal is also fighting many fires.</p>
            <p>The Spanish National Weather Agency says that temperatures in some areas are expected to reach 45 degrees Celsius today.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez spoke at a press conference in Ourense, an area badly affected by the fires. He said, "There will be many difficult days ahead. Sadly, the weather conditions are not helping us."</p>
            <p>He announced that more soldiers would be sent to help. Now, the total number of soldiers helping with disaster relief across Spain is 1,900.</p>

            <h1>Large Protest in Tel Aviv Calls for End to War and Return of Hostages</h1>
            <p>Tonight, August 17, tens of thousands of protestors gathered in Tel Aviv, Israel. They were calling for the war in Gaza to end and for the hostages to be set free. This was one of the biggest protests in Israel since the war began in October 2023.</p>
            <p>News reports say that a nationwide strike started in Israel today to put pressure on the government to stop the war. The large gathering in the evening was the peak of this protest across the country.</p>
            <p>Many people met in Tel Aviv at a place called "Hostage Square." They shouted slogans like "Bring them all home, stop the war." This square has become a main place for protests during the war.</p>
            <p>The "Hostage and Missing Families Forum," which started today's protest, estimated that about 500,000 people took part in the demonstration tonight. The police did not confirm this number.</p>
            <p>Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan Zangauker is a hostage and who is a leader of the protest movement, said: "We demand a full and possible agreement, and an end to the war. We demand our children, who should be with us."</p>
            <p>She added, "A fair war has been turned into a pointless war by the Israeli government."</p>
            <p>Today, the media showed a video message from Matan Zangauker. He looked very thin and weak, and he said he missed his family. His family stated that the Israeli army found this video, made by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>The "Hostage and Missing Families Forum" promised today that protestors would "shut down this country." Their goal is to bring back the hostages and end the war.</p>
            <p>Protestors blocked main roads in many parts of the country and burned tires. There were clashes with the police. Law enforcement officials said that more than 30 protestors were arrested.</p>
