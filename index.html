            <h1>Ride-Hailing Cars Help Many People Find Jobs in China</h1>
            <p>Many people in China do not have jobs. News reports say that the ride-hailing car business is helping many people find stable work. A new study shows that 77% of ride-hailing drivers in China started this job after they lost their old jobs. Also, for 62.8% of these drivers, this is the only job in their family.</p>
            <p>China's "Caijing" magazine reported this information. A research group at China's New Employment Forms Research Center published the study recently. The study asked more than 5,400 ride-hailing drivers in 13 provinces in China about their jobs.</p>
            <p>The study found that the average age of these drivers is 39.8 years old. More than 90% of them used to work in factories, construction, or had their own small businesses.</p>
            <p>The report also said that ride-hailing drivers in China earn about 7,623 RMB each month. This is about 32,700 New Taiwan Dollars. This income is less than what truck drivers earn (8,424 RMB). But it is more than what delivery workers earn (7,496 RMB), express delivery workers (6,124 RMB), and regular factory or construction workers (5,900 RMB).</p>
            <p>The report said that ride-hailing companies are very good at helping people find jobs quickly and earn money for their families. They offer jobs that are easy to start and are very flexible.</p>
            <p>Zhang Chenggang, a professor at Capital University of Economics and Business, said that the ride-hailing business helps China's economy when it changes. It also helps when government rules change and when industries grow.</p>
            <p>The report told a story about Li Jiarong, a 40-year-old ride-hailing driver. He used to own a hardware factory in Huizhou, Guangdong. His factory had over 100 workers at its best. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, his business had problems and he had to close it. After that, he bought an electric car and started driving for a ride-hailing company.</p>
            <p>Li Jiarong said that he "moved into the ride-hailing business right away" after his factory closed.</p>

            <h1>Three Scientists Win Nobel Prize for Finding Important Immune Cells</h1>
            <p>Today, American scientists Mary E. Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, and Japanese scientist Shimon Sakaguchi won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Medicine. They won for their work on how the body's immune system stops itself from attacking healthy parts. This is called peripheral immune tolerance.</p>
            <p>The Nobel Prize committee said that Brunkow, Ramsdell, and Sakaguchi received this honor. Their important discovery was about how the immune system works to stop it from hurting the body.</p>
            <p>These three scientists found special cells in the immune system. They are like "guards" and are called Regulatory T cells. This discovery started a new area of research. Their findings have also helped create new ways to treat diseases. Some of these new treatments are already being tested in people.</p>
            <p>People hope these discoveries can help treat or cure diseases where the immune system attacks the body (autoimmune diseases). They also hope it can make cancer treatments better. And it could stop serious problems after stem cell transplants, making these operations more successful.</p>
            <p>Mary E. Brunkow is a senior project manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, USA. Fred Ramsdell works as a science advisor at Sonoma Biotherapeutics, a biotech company in San Francisco, USA. Shimon Sakaguchi is a special professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Osaka University in Japan.</p>

            <h1>Baseball Player Hu Chin-lung Hits Home Run in Last Game</h1>
            <p>Hu Chin-lung, a 41-year-old player for the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions, is retiring this year. He often played as a pinch-hitter, showing he is still a valuable player who can perform well when needed. In his last regular season game today, he hit a 2-run home run as a pinch-hitter. This hit tied the game and was his first pinch-hit home run in his career.</p>
            <p>Hu Chin-lung will retire after this season. His team held a retirement ceremony for him on September 20th. But Hu Chin-lung continued to play in games even after the ceremony.</p>
            <p>In the last regular season game today, the Lions played against the Rakuten Monkeys at Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium. After five innings, the Lions were losing 0 to 2. In the bottom of the sixth inning, with one out, Chu Chia-en got a hit first. Then, Hu Chin-lung came in to pinch-hit and hit a home run. This home run scored 2 runs and made the score tied.</p>
            <p>This was Hu Chin-lung's second home run this season. It was his 87th home run in his Chinese Professional Baseball League career, and his first ever pinch-hit home run. Before today's game, Hu Chin-lung had played as a pinch-hitter 25 times this season. He had 11 hits and helped score 12 runs. His batting average as a pinch-hitter was 0.440.</p>
