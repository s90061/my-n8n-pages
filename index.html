            <h1>US-Japan Talks Show Big Chart; Trump Changes Numbers and Adds More Money</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Liao Han-yuan, New York, July 23) US President Donald Trump announced that the United States and Japan have made a trade deal. During their talks, a large chart on Trump's desk caught a lot of attention. It seemed that Trump himself might have changed Japan's suggested investment amount from 400 billion US dollars to 500 billion. He also put an X mark under "semiconductors," which were listed with a suggested 15% tariff.</p>
            <p>On July 22, Donald Trump announced on social media that a big trade deal with Japan was made. This deal would lower tariffs on Japan to 15%, and Japan would invest 550 billion US dollars (about 16.115 trillion New Taiwan dollars) in the US. However, a photo posted by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino on social media X got a lot of attention. The photo showed US and Japanese negotiators with Trump at the White House.</p>
            <p>In the photo, the large chart on Trump's desk clearly showed printed text. It mentioned 10% tariffs and 15% tariffs on cars, medicines, and semiconductor products, along with the number "400 billion US dollars." But the "400 billion" was changed to "500 billion," and there was an X mark under "semiconductor products." Trump's social media post later increased these numbers to 15% tariffs and 550 billion US dollars in investment.</p>
            <p>The financial news channel CNBC described Trump's negotiation style as if he was playing until the very last moment on July 22. The chart seemed to show the investment amount suggested by Japan. But it was changed to 500 billion, and his final social media post mentioned 550 billion. The White House explained that 400 billion was Japan's suggestion, and Trump added another 150 billion for the American people.</p>
            <p>On July 23, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke on Bloomberg. He said that he made that large chart and put it on the table. The main US negotiator sat behind it, and Trump sat there leading the talks.</p>
            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained on Bloomberg that cars from some countries face higher tariffs when entering the US. However, Japan offered equity, loan guarantees, and new funds for big investment projects in the US, which led to the 15% tariff.</p>
            <p>Will the 15% tariff in the US-Japan agreement become the lowest rate for other countries' negotiations? Bessent stressed that this was a different agreement. Japan received the 15% rate because it offered new ways of financing.</p>
            <p>The US and Japan have different ideas about the total investment amount in the agreement. Andy Laperriere, who is the Director of US Policy Research at Piper Sandler, an investment bank in New York, said that Japanese officials have different statements about the plans to invest in the US. He said that 550 billion US dollars is the highest possible amount, and it includes government loan guarantees.</p>
            <p>Laperriere also pointed out that Japan feels forced to accept the agreement. He believes that Japan will be slow and careful with any US investments that do not benefit Japan. (Editor: Chen Cheng-chien) July 24, 2025.</p>

            <h1>"Friends" Star Matthew Perry Died From Ketamine Overdose; Two Doctors Who Gave Him Drugs Plead Guilty</h1>
            <p>(CNA, Los Angeles, July 23, from foreign reports) Matthew Perry, an actor from the American TV show "Friends," died in 2023 from too much ketamine. One of the doctors accused of giving him ketamine had already said he was guilty. Another doctor admitted he was guilty today.</p>
            <p>On October 28, 2023, Matthew Perry was found dead in a hot tub at his home in Los Angeles. He was 54 years old. The report after his death showed he died from "the sudden effects of ketamine." Five people were charged in this case, including Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who pleaded guilty today.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that today in a Los Angeles court, he admitted to four charges of illegally giving out the controlled drug ketamine. He could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>
            <p>Plasencia is 43 years old. He will not be held in jail before his sentencing on December 3. His lawyer said that he plans to give up his doctor's license on his own within 45 days.</p>
            <p>Plasencia admitted that he gave Matthew Perry ketamine. Ketamine is a strong pain reliever that works quickly and can cause hallucinations.</p>
            <p>This controlled drug is sometimes used to treat sadness and worry. But some people also use it illegally for fun. Plasencia admitted that he injected Matthew Perry with ketamine at Perry's home and in the back seat of his car. These injections were not for a legal medical reason.</p>
            <p>Plasencia used to run an urgent care clinic. He got ketamine through another doctor from San Diego, Mark Chavez, who is also accused in this case. According to court papers, Plasencia once sent a message to Chavez saying, "I wonder how much this idiot will pay."</p>
            <p>Plasencia's lawyer said that the doctor "feels very sorry" for his choices in this case and "takes full responsibility."</p>
            <p>Chavez and two other people accused in the case had already said they were guilty, but they have not been sentenced yet.</p>
            <p>The fifth person accused, Jasveen Sangha, is called a drug dealer by US authorities and was known as the "Ketamine Queen" by her clients. She is accused of giving Matthew Perry the ketamine that caused his death, but she says she is not guilty. The court expects to start her trial in August.</p>
            <p>Matthew Perry had openly said that he struggled with drug addiction for many decades, even while starring in "Friends" in the 1990s. (Translator: Yang Wei-ching / Editor: Chen Cheng-chien) July 24, 2025.</p>
