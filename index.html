            <h1>Government Changes Worker Safety Law, Increases Punishment for Employers, Fights Workplace Bullying</h1>
            <p>To make sure workers are safer, the government today approved new changes to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The new rules add a special section about "preventing workplace bullying" and clearly explain what workplace bullying is. The changes also make punishments stronger for employers if workers die or three or more workers get hurt in accidents at work. If a worker dies, an employer could pay up to 1.5 million NT dollars and go to jail for up to 5 years, which is more than before.</p>
            <p>The government approved these changes, made by the Ministry of Labor, today. They will be sent to the lawmaking body for review. This is the biggest change to the law since 2013, with 23 sections being updated.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor said that in the past, some construction companies did not spend enough on worker safety to save money. Also, when work was given to many different smaller companies, it was hard to know who was responsible for safety. This meant that smaller companies and workers took most of the risks. So, the new law now requires large construction project owners to check for dangers and plan safety measures before work starts. They must also put money aside for safety and health costs.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor also said that if different parts of a project are given to different companies, the main owner must choose one company to be in charge of managing safety for all. All smaller companies must also follow safety rules. The new law also says that people who rent out workplaces or equipment must tell others about any dangers. Also, people who operate special machines and self-employed workers must follow safety rules.</p>
            <p>Another important part of the new law is the added section about "preventing workplace bullying." It clearly states that workplace bullying happens when a worker at their job is repeatedly treated badly by someone at the company. This bad treatment can be insulting, threatening, ignoring, isolating, or using bad words or actions. It must go beyond what is needed for work and harm the worker's mental or physical health. If the bullying is very serious, it does not need to happen many times to be considered bullying.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor also said that companies must create different ways to prevent bullying, depending on their size. These rules must be public. Companies also need to make their own systems to receive, check, and handle complaints. They must also help and protect people who complain. Companies must report bullying cases to the government. The law also explains what workers can do if the person bullying them is the company's highest boss, and it sets out punishments for not following these rules.</p>
            <p>To stop illegal actions, the new law increases the maximum jail time, fines, and administrative penalties for employers who break the rules. For criminal punishments, if a worker dies in an accident, the maximum jail time goes from 3 years to 5 years. The maximum fine goes from 300,000 NT dollars to 1.5 million NT dollars. If 3 workers are injured, the maximum jail time goes from 1 year to 3 years, and the maximum fine goes from 180,000 NT dollars to 1 million NT dollars.</p>
            <p>For administrative fines, if an employer does not provide safe facilities, the maximum fine goes from 300,000 NT dollars to 1.5 million NT dollars. If an employer does not follow management rules, the maximum fine goes from 150,000 NT dollars to 750,000 NT dollars.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor also said that the public will have more ways to check on companies. Companies that are fined will have their names, the name of the person in charge, the fine amount, the date and place of the accident, and the number of injured workers made public. This will encourage companies to take workplace safety seriously.</p>

            <h1>Government Says Money for Local Areas is to Help All Places Grow Evenly, Not Just Those Who Already Get a Lot</h1>
            <p>Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an is not happy with the government's budget office (Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, DGBAS). He thinks they are wrong to say that general grants to local governments can be changed for each city while the total amount stays the same. Today, he went to the Executive Yuan to say his opinion again. The DGBAS said that general grants must help different local areas develop equally. For example, Lienchiang County will get less shared tax money next year. If the grants were used to give more money to cities that already get a lot, it would not be fair.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan recently approved the central government's budget for next year. A new law about how money is shared means more central government money will go to local governments. Next year, local governments will get 884.1 billion NT dollars in shared taxes, which is 416.5 billion NT dollars more than this year. Also, a part of the new law says that general grants cannot be less than the amount given the year before. So, next year's budget includes 250.1 billion NT dollars for general grants, the same as this year.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chiang Wan-an recently said that the DGBAS was wrong to say that general grants could be changed for each city while the "total amount stays the same." He thinks they are cutting the general grants for some cities. Today, he went to the Executive Yuan meeting and talked about this issue again.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said after the meeting that the law about how money is shared allows the central government to give money to local governments. This is to help all parts of the country grow in a balanced way. The new law says that general grants for local areas next year cannot be lower than this year's amount, and the government has followed this rule.</p>
            <p>However, she said that the new law has a problem with how it shares money horizontally. This means almost all cities will get much more shared tax money, but Lienchiang County will not get more. Taipei City will get the most shared tax money next year, so it will have enough money for its local projects.</p>
            <p>Regarding Mayor Chiang's words, Chen Hui-juan, the Deputy Director-General of DGBAS, said at the press conference that the central government gives money to local areas in three ways: shared taxes, general grants, and project grants. General grants, by law, should help local areas develop equally and help cities that have a big gap in their basic income and expenses. But with the new law about shared taxes, almost no city has such a big gap. So, it would be very unfair to still give more money to cities that already receive a lot of central government funds.</p>
            <p>Chen Hui-juan said that while the total amount of grants is guaranteed, the government must rethink and change how it gives money to each city. This is to be fair to all cities and follow the spirit of the law. For example, the new shared tax law gives Lienchiang County less shared tax money than before. So, the central government will use general grants to help Lienchiang County. Next year, Taipei City will receive 15.6 billion NT dollars more when shared taxes and general grants are combined.</p>
            <p>Huang Hsiao-wei, the Deputy Head of the Financial Planning Division of the National Treasury Administration, explained that in previous years, shared tax money and general grants were considered together. Based on the new law's calculation, the money is calculated for islands and mainland cities, but the total amount for all areas combined means some money is not given out. This caused Lienchiang County to get less shared tax money, so the government decided to help them with general grants.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te, the Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare, said that Premier Cho Jung-tai has already ordered that the central government will not cut any money for helping disadvantaged people or for welfare. He hopes that cities that receive a lot of money will take more responsibility.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te said that cities that get a lot of grants should use the money wisely. For example, Mayor Chiang Wan-an wants to increase the Double Ninth Festival gift for elderly people from 1,500 NT dollars to 3,000 NT dollars. However, Taipei's long-term care services are only 58.6% complete, which is the lowest in Taiwan. For checking child abuse, Taipei City only gives support once every three years. So, Taipei should do more to help with long-term care and social safety net staff.</p>

            <h1>Russia Attacks Kyiv: 8 Dead, 45 Injured; Zelenskyy Asks China to Speak Out and Not Stay Quiet</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that Russia attacked Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, from the air again. At least 8 people died, and dozens were hurt. He also asked China to say something about it.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote on X (a social media platform): "Our cities and communities have been attacked again in a big way, and again people have died and been hurt." He added that one child was among the dead, and the number of deaths has now reached 8.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported, based on the latest information from Kyiv officials, that the number of dead and injured has gone up to 8 dead and 45 injured.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said this shows that Russia does not want to have "real talks" for peace.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote on X: "Russia chose to use powerful missiles, not to sit down and talk; it chose to keep killing, instead of stopping the war."</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that Zelenskyy also said Ukraine expects the world to react, for example, by putting new punishments on Russia. He especially asked China and Hungary to take a strong stand.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote: "We expect China to respond to the current situation. China has often asked for the war not to get bigger and for a ceasefire, but this has never happened because of Russia. We also expect Hungary to respond."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said: "We expect a response from everyone in the world who has asked for peace but is now often quiet instead of taking a clear stand."</p>
            <p>Earlier, Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that 4 people died and about 30 were injured in the air attack. Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, said that one 14-year-old girl was among those who died, and 5 children between 7 and 17 years old were injured with different levels of harm.</p>
            <p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko called the attack "a massive attack" that caused damage in many parts of Kyiv.</p>
            <p>Klitschko said that Russian forces launched powerful missiles, cruise missiles, and Iranian-made "Shahed" drones from different directions. He said they "systematically" targeted homes.</p>
            <p>Klitschko reported that a 5-story building collapsed in the Darnytskyi district, and a shopping center in the city center was also hit.</p>
