            <h1>Greenland's "Arctic Light 2025" Military Exercise: Denmark Did Not Invite US Military</h1>
            <p>Countries in NATO are working more together to defend the Arctic. But Denmark did not ask the US military to join its biggest military exercise in Greenland. This exercise is called "Arctic Light 2025." This happened while the US is interested in Greenland, which is a territory that is partly ruled by Denmark.</p>
            <p>The "Arctic Light 2025" exercise began on September 9th and will end on the 19th. More than 550 soldiers are taking part. They are from Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway. This group includes special forces.</p>
            <p>Soren Andersen, who is the Danish Arctic Commander, said that US military groups were not invited to the exercise. He confirmed this even though Pete Hegseth, the US Defense Secretary, was invited.</p>
            <p>Andersen told Reuters news agency, "We work with our friends at the US Pituffik Space Base in Greenland. But they were not asked to send their soldiers to this exercise."</p>
            <p>The United States has joined Danish military exercises in Greenland before. A spokesperson for the US embassy in Copenhagen said, "We are not taking part in this exercise. But we continue to work strongly with the Kingdom of Denmark and our other allies in the Arctic on military matters."</p>
            <p>Hans Peter Michaelsen, an independent military expert, told Reuters that this exercise "sends a very clear political message." He said it is "mostly to show the Americans that Greenland is Denmark's responsibility. And Denmark is getting help from other important NATO countries."</p>
            <p>Andersen, however, said that the exercise is not trying to send a message to Washington. He explained that the exercise is to get ready for possible situations where Russia and China become more active in the Arctic region.</p>

            <h1>Chen Chih-han Says Ko Wen-je's Use of Political Donations for Salaries is Legal; Taipei Prosecutors Say it's Not Legal</h1>
            <p>Chen Chih-han, who leads the legislative group for the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), said today that the Investigation Bureau sent a letter. The letter stated that it was not against the law for Ko Wen-je to use extra political donations to pay some staff at a foundation and a company.</p>
            <p>However, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office (North District Prosecutors Office) said that this letter was only a report from the Investigation Bureau about their findings. The prosecutor decided that these findings did not follow the law.</p>
            <p>Today, Chen Chih-han appeared on a political TV show with journalist Huang Guang-qin. She said that Ko Wen-je's lawyer showed a letter in court yesterday. This letter stated that during the investigation, the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau had told the Taipei District Prosecutors Office that using a candidate's leftover political donations to pay for staff costs and public relations costs (which are allowed for public office elections) is okay. It falls under the rules for leftover political donations and is not illegal.</p>
            <p>Late tonight, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office released a public statement. It said that the letter Chen Chih-han talked about was from the Investigation Bureau's Northern Mobile Station to the North District Prosecutors Office. It was about their investigation into cases where Ko Wen-je was suspected of incorrectly reporting his political donations. It was not a "reply from the Ministry of Justice."</p>
            <p>The statement explained that after looking into the case, the prosecutor found that Ko Wen-je's leftover political donations were not paid directly to staff of the Taiwan People's Party. Instead, they were paid to "Muko Company" and "Zhongwang Foundation." Then, these companies used that money to pay their employees' salaries.</p>
            <p>The North District Prosecutors Office said that Muko Company is a business that wants to make money, and Zhongwang Foundation is a charity organization. Neither of these is related to elections for public office. So, using leftover political donations to pay salaries for staff at Muko Company and Zhongwang Foundation does not fit the goal of "using funds for public office elections."</p>
            <p>The North District Prosecutors Office also added that after the presidential election last January, there were no public office elections for a short time. Also, the money was not used to pay staff for someone planning to run in an election. Because of this, there was a suspicion of the crime of using public funds for private use, and a legal case was started. Regarding the Investigation Bureau's findings, the prosecutor reviewed the investigation results and decided that they did not follow the law. The prosecutor has the power to decide what the facts are and how the law applies, and is not required to follow the Investigation Bureau's opinion.</p>
            <p>Also, the Taipei District Court held another hearing yesterday for the Jinghua City case and Ko Wen-je's political donations case. Former TPP Chairman Ko Wen-je, Muko Company Chairman Li Wen-juan, and accountant Duanmu Zheng were called as defendants. The former head of finance for Ko Wen-je's campaign, Li Wen-zong, was called as a witness. Both sides, the prosecution and the defense, asked them questions.</p>
            <p>Tonight, the Taiwan People's Party posted on Facebook. They wrote, "Yesterday, during the Taipei District Court's hearing for the Jinghua City case, the prosecutor read out messages from Ko Wen-je's LINE chat. Many of these messages had nothing to do with the case." They also asked, "Are these questions meant to strengthen the evidence in the charges, or do they have a political goal to harm someone's good name and attack their character?"</p>
            <p>In response to this, the North District Prosecutors Office explained that the LINE messages between Ko Wen-je and Li Wen-zong are important proof. They show that Ko Wen-je had the power to manage and control the money for the Taiwan People's Party, Zhongwang Foundation, Xinguoxiang Association, and Muko Company. These messages are valid as evidence. The prosecutor using these messages for questioning is a necessary way to support the facts of Ko Wen-je's alleged crime.</p>
            <p>The North District Prosecutors Office also said that Ko Wen-je's lawyer argued in court that the prosecutor's questions were like political spying. But the judge leading the trial rejected this argument in court. The judge decided that the prosecutor's questions were related to the facts of the crime in this case. This shows that the Taiwan People's Party's Facebook post gives wrong information and causes confusion, and it needs to be corrected.</p>
