            <h1>Ohtani's Two Home Runs End Dodgers' 5-Game Losing Streak; Kershaw Gets 10th Win</h1>
            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had recently lost five games in a row. The team really needed to win again during their trip to the East Coast. Japanese player Shohei Ohtani started the team's attack today with a home run in his first turn at bat. In the end, the Dodgers beat the Baltimore Orioles 5 to 2.</p>
            <p>News reports said that Shohei Ohtani brought energy to the team right away. On the second pitch of the game, he hit the ball out of the park to the middle-right side. Ohtani was the first player to bat for the team. In the third inning, he hit another home run by himself. This makes 48 home runs for him this season, placing him second in the National League for now. The Dodgers then kept their lead to stop their losing streak.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers' coach, Dave Roberts, said, "You could see the mood in the dugout quickly get better." He said, "Clearly, Ohtani hitting a home run at the start was very, very important."</p>
            <p>Just one day before, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, was almost finished with a game where no one got a hit against him. But in the ninth inning, the Orioles' player, Jackson Holliday, hit a home run alone. Then the Orioles quickly scored four runs, and the Dodgers lost 3 to 4.</p>
            <p>On this trip, the Dodgers first lost three games in a row to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who are at the bottom of their division. After that, they played the Orioles and lost two more games where the Orioles scored many runs at the end. The team felt very down and really needed to win today.</p>
            <p>"We rarely lose so many games in a row," said Clayton Kershaw, a left-handed pitcher for the Dodgers. "This is not what we are used to. When things like this happen on the field, it is certainly not fun."</p>
            <p>Kershaw pitched for 5.2 innings today and got eight strikeouts. He earned his tenth win of the season. He spoke about Ohtani's home run at the start of the game: "Anytime you can score first at the beginning of a game is a big deal." He added, "This also helped us feel better quickly after losing last night. Getting a 1-0 lead felt good."</p>
            <p>The Dodgers are now going back home as the team leading the National League West division. In this game, Ohtani not only hit two home runs but also got to base three times by walking, which helped a lot. Mookie Betts also hit a home run. Kershaw got his sixth win in a row today.</p>
            <p>Roberts said, "It was really great. Ohtani got on base five times in this game, and Betts has also been hitting the ball very well recently." He added, "The whole team had energy and played strongly. Even the players who bat later in the game did their part today."</p>
            <p>After the Dodgers won, their trip back home will feel easier. Roberts smiled and added, "This also shows how strong the team is. When Ohtani and Betts can play like this, it definitely helps a lot."</p>

            <h1>New Apple Products and Semiconductor Show: Experts Say They Will Help Taiwan's Stock Market Reach New Highs</h1>
            <p>On September 5, most main stock markets in the United States went down. The price of TSMC shares in the US went up by 3.49%, but Nvidia shares went down by 2.7%. Taiwan's stock market closed at 24494.58 points on September 5. During the day, 25 stocks reached very high prices. Experts say that Apple's fall product event and the SEMICON Taiwan International Semiconductor show will both start on the 10th. These are important events to watch to see where money will go and if Taiwan's stock market can reach new high prices again.</p>
            <p>On September 5, Taiwan's stock market rose by 314.73 points, closing at 24494.58 points. This is very close to the record high of 24519.9 points set on August 27. Apple will have its fall product event at 1 AM on the 10th, Taiwan time. They are expected to show new iPhone models, watches, and other devices.</p>
            <p>Experts said that investors will pay close attention to companies that make parts for Apple. The SEMICON Taiwan 2025 International Semiconductor show will begin its talks on the 8th and open its doors on the 10th. The show will focus on three main areas: Artificial Intelligence (AI), car semiconductors, and robot semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Looking at the US stock market on September 5, most markets dropped. This happened because bad job numbers made investors worried about the economy's future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 220.43 points, or 0.48%, ending at 45400.86 points. The S&P 500 Index dropped by 20.58 points, or 0.32%, closing at 6481.50 points. The Nasdaq Index, which mainly includes technology stocks, fell by 7.30 points, or 0.03%, ending at 21700.39 points. However, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 93.541 points, or 1.65%, closing at 5761.398 points.</p>
            <p>In Taiwan, the stock market opened high and kept rising on September 5. It closed up by 314.73 points, at 24494.58 points. The total value of shares traded was NT$416.399 billion. Foreign investors and investors from mainland China bought shares worth NT$28.281 billion. Local investment companies bought shares worth NT$5.177 billion, and investment trusts sold shares worth NT$0.473 billion. Together, these three main groups of investors bought shares worth NT$32.985 billion.</p>
            <p>Based on information from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, foreign investors bought 59,513 shares of Winbond Electronics and 31,302 shares of Nanya Technology. These were the two companies whose shares were bought the most by foreign investors. The two companies whose shares were sold the most by foreign investors were China Steel and Walsin Lihwa.</p>
            <p>Senior stock analyst Jian Bo-yi said that last week, the stock index moved up and down at a high level. The index closed at a new high recently. But the total amount of shares traded for the week did not get much larger. This means that people are waiting to see what happens with trading volume and prices. He added that if the market does not show a clear increase in trading volume soon, the market might stay in a period of bigger changes for a while.</p>

            <h1>7 Cities and Counties Warned of High Temperatures Over 36 Degrees; Expert Says Sunny and Stable Weather From the 10th</h1>
            <p>Today, the Weather Agency gave a warning about high temperatures. Seven cities and counties, including the Taipei area, should be ready for local temperatures higher than 36 degrees Celsius. Weather expert Wu Derong said that today and tomorrow, northern Taiwan will be quite hot. Everyone should be careful of strong thunderstorms in the afternoon. From the 10th, a high-pressure system from the Pacific Ocean will become stronger. This means the weather everywhere will slowly become sunny and stable.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Central Weather Agency released a high-temperature warning. The weather everywhere is hot. Today, Taipei City, New Taipei City, Changhua County, Yunlin County, Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County are under an orange warning. This means there is a chance of temperatures staying above 36 degrees for a while. Tainan City has a yellow warning, which means people should watch out for temperatures above 36 degrees.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong, a part-time associate professor at National Central University, wrote today in his weather column that the newest weather computer models from Europe show that today and tomorrow, the edges of Tropical Storm Tapah will bring some wet air. There will be a little more cloud cover everywhere, and northern Taiwan will still be warm. There might be some small, short rains in different places at different times. The air is not stable. Strong thunderstorms will happen in the mountains in the afternoon and will also reach some flat areas. People should be careful of strong thunderstorms, which can bring lightning, strong winds, and sudden heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong said that the newest European weather model also shows that on the 10th, there is still a chance of strong thunderstorms in the afternoon. From the 11th to the 13th, the Pacific high-pressure system will get stronger. The weather everywhere will be sunny and clear. There might be a small chance of short rains or thunderstorms in the mountains in the afternoon, but they will not be as strong and will cover a smaller area. On the 14th, the Pacific high-pressure system will get even stronger. The weather everywhere will be sunny and very hot. There will be a small chance of some rain in the mountains in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong also said that the newest weather map from the Weather Agency shows that Tropical Storm Tapah is moving towards the north-northwest. This morning, it will land east of Yangjiang City in Guangdong, China. After it lands, it will become weaker. The newest European model also shows that the Pacific high-pressure system will get stronger, and there are no signs of other tropical storms or bad weather forming in the Northwest Pacific in the next week.</p>
