            <h1>Liwu River Landslide Lake Can Be Dug Out and Drained; Ministry of Agriculture Explains Differences with Matai'an River</h1>
            <p>A landslide happened at the Swallow Grotto Trail in Taroko National Park. This made a lake of water blocking the Liwu River. The lake water then flowed over Provincial Highway 8 near Jinheng Tunnel around midnight. Now, the water is flowing back into the main Liwu River.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture showed new pictures and said the danger is less now. So, they plan to use diggers to make a path through the blockage. This will help the river water flow normally.</p>
            <p>Some people asked why they can dig at the Liwu River landslide lake but not at the Matai'an River landslide lake. The Ministry of Agriculture explained three main differences.</p>
            <p>First, the sizes of the blockages are very different. The Matai'an River blockage is 200 meters high, has 200 million cubic meters of earth, and holds 91 million tons of water. But the Swallow Grotto blockage is 54 meters high, has 400,000 cubic meters of earth, and holds 2.7 million tons of water. So, the Swallow Grotto blockage is much, much smaller, only 0.2% the size of the Matai'an River one.</p>
            <p>Second, it is easier to get to the Swallow Grotto blockage. The Matai'an River blockage is high up in the mountains, about 1000 meters high. There are no roads, and it takes five days to walk there. But the Swallow Grotto blockage is right next to Provincial Highway 8. People and cars can get there easily, and machines can start working quickly.</p>
            <p>Third, the work to fix it is much harder for the Matai'an River blockage. The water from the Matai'an River blockage would flow for more than 13 kilometers down a narrow, steep valley with a big drop. Building a temporary road would take at least three months, and it is still the flood season until November. But the Swallow Grotto blockage is small and close to Provincial Highway 8. Machines can get there fast to do the work to reduce the danger.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture wants to remind everyone that the road from Jinheng Tunnel to Swallow Grotto on Provincial Highway 8 is still a dangerous area. The Highway Bureau has closed the road. People should not go into this area or go near the river to look. This is to keep everyone safe and prevent accidents.</p>

            <h1>Hong Kong Parliament Election at Year-End; Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Says No "Blessed List"</h1>
            <p>The Legislative Council in Hong Kong will have new elections at the end of this year. Recently, some members who are working there now have said they will not try to be re-elected.</p>
            <p>On October 17, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, which is part of the Chinese government, released an article. It said that it is normal for members of the Legislative Council to change over time through elections. The article also said that all people who can run for election will compete in the same fair way. There is no "special list" of favored candidates, and no one will get special treatment.</p>
            <p>The article, signed "Gang'aoping," explained that in earlier elections, people who were against China and caused trouble, along with people working for other countries, used problems in the old election rules. They got into the Legislative Council and caused many problems. But after the election in December 2021, when the rule of "patriots governing Hong Kong" was put in place, the Legislative Council started working correctly again.</p>
            <p>The article also mentioned that news in Hong Kong shows that as the time for nominations gets closer, some current members are choosing not to run again for different reasons. Also, some political groups have said they will try to win seats, and new people from various areas are thinking about running.</p>
            <p>The article stated that "it is normal for the Legislative Council to have changes in its members through elections, and this is a true part of democracy." It also clearly said that with the new election rules, the main goal is to choose good and capable people. Fair and positive competition is very important. "Any person who is legally confirmed to be a suitable candidate will start the competition in the same fair way. There is no such thing as a 'blessed list,' and no one will get 'special treatment.'"</p>
            <p>The article hopes that this election will choose members for the Legislative Council who are stronger in their love for their country and Hong Kong, who are younger, more professional, and have new and fresh ideas.</p>
            <p>The Hong Kong Legislative Council election will be in December, and people can start putting their names forward to run on October 24. Many people in Hong Kong politics believe that the government in Beijing wants younger members in the Legislative Council. They think that members who are over 70 years old might not be allowed to stay.</p>
            <p>Liu Zhaojia, an advisor for a group that studies Hong Kong and Macao, told local news that both the government in Beijing and the general public want younger members in the Legislative Council. With the rule of "patriots governing Hong Kong," there are no longer any members who are against China and cause trouble. This means there might not be as much need for older members who have a lot of experience fighting against such groups, to guide the younger members.</p>
            <p>There are also rumors that other members who will not run again include those who did not do well in parliament, those who spoke out more often, and party members from a specific group called the Election Committee.</p>
            <p>So far, fifteen members who are in the Legislative Council now have said they will not try to be re-elected. Eight of these are over 70 years old. Also, many members in their thirties and forties have decided not to run again.</p>
            <p>The Hong Kong newspaper "Sing Tao Daily" recently reported that companies from mainland China will actively send their staff to run in the election. Many people from Hong Kong who are part of China's National People's Congress also plan to run.</p>

            <h1>US Media: Trump Refused to Give Zelenskyy Tomahawk Missiles; Meeting Was Not Good</h1>
            <p>The Axios news website said that two people who know about the matter reported that Ukraine's President Zelenskyy tried hard to get Tomahawk missiles from the President of the United States, Donald Trump. But Trump said no.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, President Zelenskyy spoke to European leaders in a video call. The European leaders were confused because Trump's feelings seemed to have changed again.</p>
            <p>The news report explained that President Zelenskyy had hoped to get a promise for new weapons for Ukraine when he visited Washington. But he found that Trump's ideas were completely different after Trump spoke on the phone with Russian President Putin the day before.</p>
            <p>People who knew about the meeting between the two leaders said that Trump clearly stated that his main focus right now is talking to people to solve problems (diplomacy). He believed that giving Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine at this time might stop these diplomatic efforts.</p>
            <p>One person described the meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy as "not easy." Another person said it was "bad."</p>
            <p>The sources said that no one yelled during the meeting, but Trump was very serious. "Trump said some strong things during the meeting, and sometimes he seemed a bit emotional."</p>
            <p>During the meeting, Trump quickly told Zelenskyy what he talked about with Putin yesterday. Trump also said that the US plan for peace now is to "stop" the fighting along the areas that Russia and Ukraine control on the battlefield. But Ukraine would find it very difficult to agree to stop the war along these current lines.</p>
            <p>The report also mentioned that the meeting, which lasted two and a half hours, ended suddenly. Trump said, "I think we'll stop here and see what happens next week." This probably meant the talks between the US and Russia that would happen soon. Trump plans to meet Russian President Putin in Budapest, Hungary, in two weeks.</p>
            <p>However, after the meeting, Trump posted on his social media account, "Truth Social." He described the meeting as "interesting" and "friendly." He also wrote that he had told Zelenskyy and Putin that "it's time to stop fighting," and "let both sides say they won, and let history decide!"</p>
            <p>Trump then went straight to his Mar-a-Lago club and did not answer questions from reporters. After his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy immediately had a video call with several European leaders. One person who was in that call said that some European leaders were confused because Trump's attitude had clearly changed again.</p>
            <p>Soon after, European leaders started to make strong statements together, saying they support Ukraine. Axios believes this shows that the meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy today was not successful.</p>
            <p>Before meeting Trump, Zelenskyy's main assistant told Axios that Zelenskyy's most important goal for this trip was not only to get Tomahawk missiles but also a promise for many other weapons that Ukraine urgently needs.</p>
            <p>When asked by reporters, Zelenskyy confirmed that they did talk about Tomahawk missiles. But he said that he and Trump decided not to tell the public the details because the US wants to avoid the situation becoming worse. When asked if he still felt positive about getting Tomahawk missiles, Zelenskyy answered, "I am practical."</p>
            <p>But the sources said that Zelenskyy actually tried very hard to get the Tomahawk missiles during the meeting, but Trump refused clearly and did not change his mind.</p>
            <p>A person who knew about the video call between Ukraine and Europe said that the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, suggested that they should work with the US. He thought they could use Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza as an example to make a peace plan for Ukraine.</p>
