            <h1>Future Medical Student Shares Experience After Four Schools Cancelled Admission</h1>
            <p>A high school student in Taichung had his application documents for university entry accused of being fake. Because of this, four universities took back their offers of admission. Later, he passed a different exam and was accepted into the medical department at National Cheng Kung University. Today, he talked about his experience. He said that if he could do it again, he would make sure the name on his award certificate was correct from the start, and then there would be no problem.</p>
            <p>The student shared on social media that he was accepted into the medical department at Yang Ming Chiao Tung University through the application process. His application documents said he took part in a high school debate competition called the "Elite Cup" and won the "Best Debater" award. However, people online questioned this. They said he was not the "Best Debater" for that year's Elite Cup, but only an "Excellent Debater" in one match.</p>
            <p>He was originally accepted by National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei Medical University, China Medical University, and Chung Shan Medical University. But because his application documents were said to be fake, these four schools later took back their offers of admission.</p>
            <p>Before the new school year started, this first-year university student was interviewed by a cram school today. In the live broadcast, he talked about his experience. He said he never thought he would be in the news like this. Because of a mistake in the words he used in his documents, he kept getting notices from the universities that had accepted him. He tried his best to explain clearly. When the first university cancelled his admission, he knew it was "over."</p>
            <p>After his university admissions were cancelled, he felt very bad and could not eat. Even though he went back to school to study by himself, he had no energy to read. He lost 7 kilograms quickly. With so many people talking about him, he even wondered, "Am I a murderer?" But he knew he had made a mistake. He thought if he had written the award name correctly at the beginning, there would have been no problem.</p>
            <p>He said that after the General Scholastic Ability Test (GSAT), he did not touch his books again. With only about 30 days left, he still had 16 textbooks for the subject-specific test that he had not read. He had thought about preparing for a re-examination, saying he was confident he could raise his GSAT score from 70 to 75 if he had six months. But his mother said, "Is it hard to do something you've already done again?" After hearing this, he changed his mindset and started to work hard for the subject-specific test.</p>
            <p>He also said that when he first shared his learning journey online, he simply wanted to help others. When he was applying, he could not find good examples from older students. After he was accepted into medical school, one of his application files received a very high score. Some people asked him for advice, and he thought he could share his preparation materials online for others to use as a guide.</p>
            <p>To prepare for the subject-specific test for university admission in a short time, he said he finished reading the physics textbooks he had not read in three days. For all subjects, he practiced many past exam questions and different types of problems repeatedly. He corrected the wrong answers and made sure he understood them. Finally, he got into medical school again.</p>
            <p>He said he decided to focus on the subject-specific test only 35 days before it. That day was his graduation ceremony, and he also told his girlfriend he liked her. He believed that if he pulled the bowstring all the way back, the arrow would hit the target and not fall short.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan Prosecutors Investigate CSIST Bid Data Leak; Technician Lin Detained and Barred from Visitors</h1>
            <p>A technician named Lin from the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST) is suspected of leaking information about a project. The project was for the "Pengyuan Campus Smart Monitoring and Command System Network and Electrical Infrastructure Engineering." On September 2nd, prosecutors in Taoyuan took him in for questioning. The Taoyuan District Court decided today that Mr. Lin should be held in custody and not allowed to see anyone. This is because they believe he might destroy evidence or talk to others involved in the crime.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, the chairman of the Taiwan People's Party, said on September 2nd that someone inside CSIST was selling secret documents about the project to companies. CSIST replied that its own security system found unusual copying of documents. They reported the case to the Military Police Command on August 14th, asking prosecutors to investigate. CSIST said it will fully protect its rights and make sure that those involved get the harshest punishment to stop others from doing the same.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors' Office released a statement today. They said that on the afternoon of September 2nd, they received a request from the New Taipei Military Police to lead the investigation into the leaked project documents. This project was for the "Pengyuan Campus Smart Monitoring and Command System Network and Electrical Infrastructure Engineering" at the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology. They immediately assigned prosecutor Lai Ying-ying from the anti-corruption team to handle the case.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan prosecutors said that later that evening, they arrested the technician, Mr. Lin, who works at CSIST's Information and Communications Research Institute. After questioning him, the prosecutor believed that he was involved in serious crimes, such as leaking non-defense secrets as a non-government worker and attempted breach of trust. They thought he might try to talk to other people involved, witnesses, or destroy evidence. So, last night, they asked the Taoyuan District Court to hold him in custody and not let him see anyone.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Court stated that after questioning, the accused admitted to the crimes. Also, there was evidence listed in the request for his detention. This shows that the accused is highly suspected of attempted breach of trust and leaking non-defense secrets as a non-government worker. Even though the accused admitted to the crimes, his statements about important details like what information he gave to others, how it was given, when, where, and for how much money, were not consistent. This suggests he was trying to make the situation seem less serious.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Court pointed out that the suspect's electronic devices have not yet been fully checked by digital forensic experts, and others involved in the crime have not yet been brought in. Therefore, it is possible that the suspect might talk to others involved or destroy evidence to get a lighter sentence, which could make the case unclear. Also, the suspect himself deleted conversations with others involved on Line. This shows that the suspect actively tried to destroy evidence and stop the police and prosecutors from investigating.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Court stated that there is enough evidence to believe the suspect might talk to others involved and destroy evidence. This is why he needs to be detained. The court also considered that the suspect's crime is not a small one. After looking at how far the investigation has gone and using the principle of proportionality, the court decided that the suspect needs to be held and not allowed to see or talk to anyone.</p>

            <h1>Russia-Ukraine War: Scholar Says Early End to War Benefits Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Today, Lin Cheng-yi, a researcher from Academia Sinica's Institute of European and American Studies, spoke at a meeting. He said that it would be good for Taiwan if the war between Russia and Ukraine ended soon. This is because China would then get more attention from the United States. After events like 9/11 or the financial crisis, the US had a long time to focus on other things, but this would not happen if the war ended.</p>
            <p>On September 4th, the Institute for National Policy Research held a meeting at the Chang Yung-fa Foundation. The meeting was about "Current International Situations: Strategic Meanings from the Alaska Meeting, SCO Summit, to WWII Remembrance."</p>
            <p>At the meeting, Lin Cheng-yi said that Beijing does not want Russia to lose the war in Ukraine. China worries that if Russia loses, the United States will focus more on China. He believes that if the Russia-Ukraine war ends sooner, it will be good for Taiwan. China will get more attention from the United States, unlike after 9/11 or the financial crisis when the US had a long break.</p>
            <p>Lin Cheng-yi also pointed out that the military cooperation between China and Russia is now more than just between two countries. It includes working together in ways that affect other countries. He said their relationship seems to have no limits. If there were problems in the Taiwan Strait, Russia would likely not just watch. It might use the chance to cause trouble in Europe, which would involve NATO. This could stop European countries from helping the United States in the Indo-Pacific and the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>On September 15th, the presidents of the United States, Donald Trump, and Russia, Vladimir Putin, had a meeting in Alaska. They did not agree on how to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Former US representative Kao Suo-tai said at the meeting that the Alaska talks were not seen as good, not wished well, and will not be remembered. He called it a quickly arranged and hastily held summit. People around the world also thought that a summit trying to find a breakthrough for a war that has lasted over three years would probably just be for show and not achieve anything.</p>
            <p>Kao Suo-tai believes that the Alaska talks showed the plain truth of international politics. He thought that many European countries would immediately think of past events like the 1938 Munich Agreement and the 1945 Yalta Secret Agreement. These were times when bigger countries secretly decided the future of smaller countries, affecting their independence and land.</p>
            <p>Kao Suo-tai mentioned that the Alaska talks showed Donald Trump's style of making quick decisions, wanting quick results, and liking big achievements. Trump strongly believed in leader-to-leader diplomacy and special envoys made of his closest advisors. He often made decisions based on his feelings, which involved big risks and unpredictability. However, it must be said that this has become a new normal and a new way for the White House to handle important issues.</p>
            <p>Wu Jun-chih, director of the Democratic Progressive Party's China Affairs Department, said that before the September 3rd military parade, Chinese President Xi Jinping talked about "speeding up the building of a world-class army, firmly protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity." Wu said this shows China's strong desire for Taiwan's land. He also said that China's focus on a "strong military dream" clearly challenged the United States.</p>
