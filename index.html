            <h1>Government: Rental Help Expanded, Families with Kids Can Live in Public Housing for 12 Years</h1>
            <p>The government wants to help people get married, have children, and raise them. Chen Shih-chung, a minister without portfolio, said today that the government will start four new policies to help people live in stable homes. One of these is "marriage and childbearing housing." From this year until 2028, the government will offer 11,000 homes from public housing for families with children aged 0 to 6. These families can live in these homes for 12 years. Also, the government will give more rental help. Now, people can get help if their average monthly income is less than 3.5 times the minimum living expense. For newly married couples, the help will be 1.5 times more. For each extra child, it will increase by 0.5 times.</p>
            <p>The government will discuss and approve a plan tomorrow called "Youth Marriage and Childbearing Rental Assistance Program" and a "Flexible Parental Leave Program."</p>
            <p>Minister Chen told reporters today that the government needs to change its policies because fewer people are having children and society is changing. The government will encourage people to have stable homes and create friendly workplaces. This will reduce stress for parents who are taking care of children. The four "stable home" policies include marriage and childbearing housing, changes to the rental management system, wider rental subsidies, and changes to the Rental Housing Market Development and Management Act. By 2032, these policies are expected to help 480,000 households and cost 26.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Regarding marriage and childbearing housing, Chen Shih-chung pointed out that in the past, there were not enough such homes in public housing, but many people needed them. So, the government will now use 20% of its public housing units, which is 11,000 homes, for marriage and childbearing housing. 1,000 of these homes will be ready in the second half of this year. Another 10,000 homes will be ready from next year until 2028.</p>
            <p>As for who can apply, Chen Shih-chung explained that families with children aged 0 to 6 can apply. Currently, people can live in public housing for a maximum of 6 years. To stop newly married couples or new parents from moving often, the living period for marriage and childbearing housing will be changed to 12 years. This means children can stay in the same home and school district until they finish primary school. The government plans to let families already in marriage and childbearing housing use this new rule too.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Chen Shih-chung said that rental subsidies will be given to more people. Before, the main rule was that a person's average monthly income had to be less than 3 times the minimum living expense. Now, it will be expanded to 3.5 times. Newly married couples will get 1.5 times more help, and for each extra child, it will increase by 0.5 times. For example, if the highest monthly subsidy in Taipei City is NT$8,000, a newly married couple with one child will receive NT$16,000 in rental subsidy.</p>
            <p>About the rental management system, Chen Shih-chung said that renters with children aged 0 to 6 will get NT$6,000 each year for child safety. They can use this money for things like anti-collision padding, anti-tip devices, or safety locks.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung also mentioned that the current rental market is not very fair to renters. So, the Ministry of the Interior is planning to suggest changes to the Rental Housing Market Development and Management Act by the end of September. The main points include: First, giving renters more security with their rental period, with a minimum of 3 years. Second, making sure rent increases are fair, using the government's housing rent index to decide what is reasonable. Third, protecting renters' rights. If a landlord refuses a renter's application for rental subsidy or refuses to let them register their household, there might be punishments. Fourth, if there are rental problems in the future, the government will offer free help to solve them.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung stressed that only the rental act needs to be changed for the stable home policies. All other parts of the plan will be put into action together, starting on January 1, 2026, except for the marriage and childbearing housing released this year.</p>

            <h1>National Archives Starts Trial Operations on September 2nd, Nearly 3,000 Visitors on First Day</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's first National Archives is in Linkou District, New Taipei City. It started trial operations on September 2nd. On the first day of trial operations yesterday, many people came, with nearly 3,000 visitors. The National Development Council said that the first special exhibition is "Returning to 1987 â€“ Martial Law Era Archives." It shows how democracy moved forward using important government records.</p>
            <p>The National Archives brings together different functions like administration, storing records, and offering many services. On the first to third floors, there are permanent exhibition halls, special exhibition halls, a children's experience room with "A-Kai-Jiang," the National Archives mascot, a National Archives reading center, and a cultural and creative shop. It also has a light meal coffee shop with WALK IN Cafe. The building keeps three-quarters of its green area, creating a place that combines national memory with a relaxing and educational environment.</p>
            <p>Lin Chiu-yen, the Director of the National Archives Administration, said that even though archives seem far from our daily lives, they are very connected to people. The first permanent exhibition, "Island Reading â€“ Our Story," lets people use national archives to understand how the country and people's lives changed after 1945.</p>
            <p>The special exhibition "Returning to 1987 â€“ Martial Law Era Archives" uses key national archives from the period "from restriction to lifting" to show how democracy moved forward. The Archives Administration said that important documents like the "Lifting of Martial Law Order," the change of the "Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion National Security Law" to the "National Security Act," the government's end of the "Statute for the Punishment of Sedition" and the "Rules for the Investigation of Spies During the Period of Communist Rebellion," and the changed Article 100 of the "Criminal Code" will also be shown.</p>
            <p>The National Archives has created interactive areas that use sight and touch. On the first floor, the "Archives Hall" shows archive stories on a huge multimedia screen. On the second floor, "A-Kai-Jiang's Cabin" invites parents and children to explore the fun of archives. There is also a special area called "Archives Fun Experience" in the exhibition hall. Here, people can try being an "archive professional" for a day and learn its secrets. They can also travel through an "Archive Metaverse" using new technology.</p>
            <p>The National Archives Administration said that for the first "Time Postbox" event during trial operations, all 1,000 limited edition time postcards were taken on the first day. The first 100 gachapon machine gifts were also given out within half an hour of opening.</p>
            <p>The National Archives will continue to offer various events, such as "Time Painting â€“ National Archives Drawing Competition," "Archives Play Big â€“ Storeroom Puzzle," and "Time and Space Management Bureau is Hiring."</p>
            <p>The National Archives is at No. 1 Archives Road, Linkou District, New Taipei City. It is open from Tuesday to Saturday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. It is closed on Sundays, Mondays, national holidays, and long holidays.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Russian, Chinese, North Korean Leaders Plan Against US; Kremlin Says No</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump posted that the leaders of China, Russia, and North Korea are "planning against the United States." In response, the Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not planning against the US with the leaders of China and North Korea. The Kremlin also said that Trump's comments might be a joke.</p>
            <p>Today, China held a military parade on September 3rd. Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping were all there together.</p>
            <p>On the evening of September 2nd, US time, Trump posted on his social media platform "Truth Social." He said he wished Xi Jinping and the Chinese people "a great and lasting day of celebration." He added, "As you plan against the United States, please give my best wishes to Putin and Kim Jong Un."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that when Russian state TV asked the Kremlin about Trump's words today, Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy advisor to the Kremlin, answered: "I want to say, nobody is planning, nobody is doing anything, there is no plan. Nobody has such ideas, none of these three leaders."</p>
            <p>Ushakov said that Trump's words might be meant as a joke. He added, "Everyone understands the role of the United States, the current Trump administration, and President Trump himself in the current world situation."</p>
            <p>Trump also said on a radio show on September 2nd that he was "very disappointed" with Putin. Since meeting Putin in Alaska in August, Trump has kept pushing for the Russian leader to have talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Instead, Russia has increased its attacks on Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Also, regarding Putin meeting Xi Jinping in Beijing and attending a big military parade, Trump told reporters at the White House on September 2nd that he was not worried about a possible alliance between Russia and China. He also said, "We have the strongest military in the world, and it's much stronger. They will definitely not fight us, believe me."</p>
