The city's health department found the new case by actively testing more people. So far this year, Kaohsiung City has 10 local dengue fever cases, which have caused outbreaks in 4 families.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Department stated in a press release that the new dengue fever case reported today is a man in his 70s from Baoshu Village, Gushan District. He had no symptoms. He is a family member of yesterday's confirmed case. The health department found him through more testing, and his case is part of the current community outbreak.</p>
            <p>The health department said that Kaohsiung City has 10 local dengue fever cases this year, leading to outbreaks in 4 families. The new patient today was active in many places in Yancheng District when he could spread the disease. So, the prevention team has started emergency control around his home and activity areas. They are also cleaning and tidying up Yancheng Market and other market areas.</p>
            <p>The health department added that different city departments are still working together to prevent the disease in the warning areas. For example, district office teams are checking 13 dirty spots and telling those in charge to clean them within 24 hours. The cleaning team is helping remove trash and containers with standing water.

            <p>Also, departments like Economic Development, Education, Tourism, MRT, and Parks are checking their areas. The Gushan District command center plans to have different departments work together tomorrow morning to clean up Baoshu Village and three other villages in Gushan District.</p>

            <h1>HBL Nanshan's Good Shooter Huang Han-sheng Injured His Knee, Might Return at Quarterfinals at the Earliest</h1>
            <p>Huang Han-sheng, a key guard for the strong High School Basketball League (HBL) team Nanshan High School, tore his right knee's anterior cruciate ligament. He might return to the games at the earliest during the quarterfinals. Coach Chen Bo-ting said today that they will not rush Huang Han-sheng's return because "a player's career is very long."</p>
            <p>After Nanshan High School failed to win the championship last HBL season, they trained hard in the off-season, hoping to win the championship cup. But their main shooter, Huang Han-sheng, accidentally tore his right knee's anterior cruciate ligament during the Changyao Cup basketball game. This means he will miss the new school year's top 16 preliminary rounds and top 12 playoff rounds, which is a big loss for Nanshan's team strength.</p>
            <p>Chen Bo-ting told reporters today after the Dengfeng Zaoluo basketball game that Huang Han-sheng has had surgery. He might be able to return to the HBL games at the earliest during the quarterfinals. However, Chen hopes Huang Han-sheng rests more and will not rush his return. He must also get permission from the team's medical trainer. Chen said, "A player's career is very long, and this path is still far. Don't worry too much, and I hope to see him running on the court again."</p>
            <p>Even though Huang Han-sheng's absence will affect the team's strength, Chen Bo-ting said that Huang Han-sheng participated in many tournaments and training camps during the summer. He has been away from team training for some time, so the team is somewhat used to playing without him. Chen hopes another main player, Hsieh Min-geng, will take on more responsibility, including being the one to take the last shot and finish plays. He wants Hsieh to "make the most of his special skills."</p>
            <p>Huang Han-sheng won the HBL Rookie of the Year and the Championship Game MVP in his first year of high school. He also recently won the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) award for the men's group at the NIKE ALL ASIA CAMP. However, his third year of high school started with an injury. He admitted that he was sad for a few days after confirming his knee injury, but he quickly adjusted his mindset and looked at the injury positively, saying, "I won't rush; life is not just about HBL."</p>
            <p>The Dengfeng Zaoluo basketball game started today at the Taipei Arena. Nanshan lost their first game 58-71 to Guangfu High School. Chen Bo-ting said that since the experienced players have already graduated, the team has been playing games almost constantly from early August until now. This helps the players gain experience and grow quickly.</p>

            <h1>"March For Australia" Anti-Immigration Rally: Australian Government Says it Spreads Hate</h1>
            <p>The center-left government of Australia today criticized anti-immigration rallies held in Sydney and other big cities. The government said these events tried to spread hate and were linked to neo-Nazis.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that "The March For Australia" organizers held anti-immigration protests today in Sydney, Australia's most populated city, and in several state and territory capital cities. The organizers claim on their official website that "Mass immigration has broken the close connections in our communities."</p>
            <p>"The March For Australia" posted on X (formerly Twitter) yesterday that the goal of the rally was to "do what mainstream politicians never dare to do: demand an end to mass immigration."</p>
            <p>In Australia, one out of two people was either born overseas or has at least one parent born overseas. In recent years, Australia has been having problems with the rise of far-right extremism, which includes protests organized by neo-Nazis.</p>
            <p>Murray Watt, the Labor government's Minister for the Environment and Water, spoke to Sky News about the Sydney rally. He said, "We strongly condemn the 'March For Australia' rally held today. This does nothing to improve social harmony."</p>
            <p>Watt stressed, "We do not support such rallies. These actions only spread hate and divide our society." He pointed out that these events were "started and promoted" by neo-Nazi groups.</p>
            <p>According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) report, about 5,000 to 8,000 people attended the Sydney rally.</p>
            <p>Near "The March For Australia" rally in Sydney, the community action group "Refugee Action Coalition" held a counter-rally. A spokesperson for the coalition said in a statement, "Our event showed strong disgust and anger towards the extreme right-wing goals of 'The March For Australia'." The organizers said that hundreds of people attended their event.</p>
