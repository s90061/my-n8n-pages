            <h1>China's Trade Representative Li Chenggang to Visit Washington; US Says It's Not Formal Talks</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that China's trade representative, Li Chenggang, will go to Washington this week. He will have trade talks with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and officials from the Treasury Department. A US government spokesperson confirmed this news. However, the spokesperson said that Li Chenggang might meet with lower-level US officials, and this visit is not part of official talks between the two countries.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported on August 25 that Li Chenggang, who is also China's Vice Minister of Commerce, will go to Washington this week. He will meet with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and officials from the Treasury Department. This is expected to be the first time they talk in the US capital. Both sides want to create regular communication during a longer period where tariffs are paused. Also, Li Chenggang will talk with US business leaders.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported on August 26 that a US government spokesperson confirmed Li Chenggang's visit to Washington this week. He might meet with US government officials who are not at the very top level. But the spokesperson added that this visit is not part of a formal meeting for talks.</p>
            <p>Sources told the report that there are no plans for Li Chenggang to meet with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Also, he is not coming because the US asked him to.</p>
            <p>On August 11, the US and China agreed to pause tariffs for another 90 days. The US has a 30% tax on goods from China, and China has a 10% tax on goods from the US.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal stated that the Trump government has recently become less strict with Beijing. It is trying to make an economic agreement with China. Both sides agreed not to raise tariffs. They also agreed to loosen some rules on sending important goods, like rare earth magnets from China and some technology products from the US.</p>
            <p>However, trade problems between the US and China are still ongoing. Earlier in August, US President Donald Trump asked China to buy a lot more soybeans from the US. But China has not agreed to this yet. At the same time, the US government is getting ready to check imports of Chinese steel, copper, and lithium more closely. This is to stop goods from Xinjiang made with forced labor from coming into the US. It also helps reach the goal of lowering the trade difference with China.</p>
            <p>During this week's talks, Li Chenggang is expected to discuss buying soybeans.</p>
            <p>However, Reuters, quoting sources, pointed out that the timing of this visit is difficult. This is because China's Ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, recently criticized Trump's trade policies strongly. He said that the Trump government's rules stopping Chinese citizens from buying farmland are "political games."</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal, quoting people who know, said that Beijing will continue to ask the Trump government to remove the 20% tax on Fentanyl-related products. This must happen before they promise to buy goods like soybeans or Boeing planes.</p>

            <h1>9 New Cases of Melioidosis, 1 Death; 6 New Cases of Leptospirosis</h1>
            <p>Today, Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced 9 new local cases of melioidosis from August 19 to 25. One person died 10 days after getting sick because of pneumonia and serious breathing problems. Also, there are 6 new local cases of leptospirosis. One person with leptospirosis is still in intensive care.</p>
            <p>Tseng Shu-hui, a spokesperson for the CDC, said in a regular report today that from August 19 to 25, there were 9 new local cases of melioidosis, and one of them died. One case was in northern Taiwan, and eight cases were in southern Taiwan. The patients were between 40 and 90 years old. Most had long-term health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney disease. They started feeling sick between late June and mid-August. This year, there have been 50 local melioidosis cases, with 5 deaths. This is the third highest number for this time of year.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lin Yung-ching, a doctor who deals with epidemics, explained the death. The person who died was a man in his 50s from southern Taiwan. He had several long-term health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney disease. In mid-August, he started coughing. In late August, he also had diarrhea and a runny nose. He went to a clinic twice and was told he had diarrhea and a common cold.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lin Yung-ching said that later, the man had a fever and trouble breathing. He went to the emergency room, where doctors found his oxygen level was low. Blood tests showed he had more white blood cells and signs of inflammation. He had a tube put in to help him breathe and was given antibiotics. But his pneumonia got worse, and he sadly died the next day. The cause of death was pneumonia with serious breathing problems. Later, tests of his blood showed the melioidosis bacteria.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lin Yung-ching noted that their investigation found a wound on the man's foot. However, he did not go out during the typhoon, and there was no flooding near his home. So, it is not clear if he touched dirty water or mud. But because his main symptoms were related to his lungs, he might have breathed in the bacteria that caused the illness.</p>
            <p>Last week, there were also 6 new local cases of leptospirosis. Tseng Shu-hui said one case was in northern Taiwan, one in central Taiwan, and four in southern Taiwan. The patients were between 20 and 70 years old. They started feeling sick between late July and mid-August. Most of them went to the doctor because of fever, muscle pain, or diarrhea. This year, there have been 34 local cases of leptospirosis, which is less than the average for the past five years.</p>
            <p>Kuo Hung-wei, the director of the CDC's Epidemic Command Center, explained that their investigation found that four of these patients worked in mountains, farms, or vegetable gardens. One patient lived near stray animals. Also, four of the patients had touched dirty water or mud. Five patients have already left the hospital after treatment. One patient is still in intensive care. No one who lived or worked with these patients showed signs of illness. Health officials have given them information about staying healthy.</p>
            <p>Regarding the patient in intensive care, Dr. Lin Yung-ching explained that she is a woman in her 60s from southern Taiwan. She has a history of high blood pressure. In early August, she started having diarrhea and feeling tired. She went to a clinic and was told she had stomach flu. Because her fever and general weakness continued, she went to the emergency room. Her awareness became worse, so she was admitted to intensive care. Doctors reported that she had leptospirosis and other infections. The investigation found that she had touched dirty water or mud. She is currently in intensive care with a breathing tube.</p>

            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai: Government Spends NT$69.3 Billion on Typhoon Danas Recovery and Rebuilding</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that a special budget of NT$60 billion has been set aside for rebuilding after Typhoon Danas. This money will be used for 9 different recovery projects in affected areas. All of this money will come from borrowing. If we add other related money that was already planned, money moved from other areas for urgent needs, and special shared tax funds, the government will spend a total of NT$69.3 billion on disaster relief and rebuilding this time.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, the Legislative Yuan invited Premier Cho Jung-tai, Budget Director Chen Shu-tzu, Finance Minister Chuang Tsui-yun, and heads of relevant government departments. They were there to talk about how the "Special Budget for Recovery and Rebuilding after Typhoon Danas and Heavy Rains on July 28" was made, and to answer questions.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Premier Cho Jung-tai said that the Executive Yuan created this special budget plan based on the "Central Government Special Act for Recovery and Rebuilding after Typhoon Danas and Heavy Rains on July 28." The plan includes spending NT$60 billion, which will be used from August 19 this year until December 31, 2027. All the money needed will come from borrowing.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that the Ministry of Agriculture will receive NT$20.3 billion, the Ministry of Economic Affairs NT$18.7 billion, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications NT$6.9 billion, the Council of Indigenous Peoples NT$4.6 billion, the Ministry of the Interior NT$3.8 billion, the Ministry of Environment NT$1.6 billion, the Ministry of Education NT$400 million, the Ministry of Culture NT$300 million, the National Communications Commission NT$300 million, and the Public Construction Commission NT$100 million. An additional NT$3 billion is set aside for emergencies.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho stated that this special budget plan includes 9 types of projects for recovery and rebuilding in disaster areas. These include NT$10.1 billion for agricultural facilities like farm roads, livestock sheds, storage, and farm equipment. NT$11 billion is for power systems, like electricity lines and backup systems. NT$300 million is for communication systems, like cell towers and satellite backups, and cable TV systems. NT$300 million is for water, gas, and fuel facilities.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also said that NT$4.8 billion is for homes and public buildings, such as house repairs, schools, and government offices. NT$11.1 billion is for water management facilities, including river control, drainage systems, and coastal protection. NT$8.9 billion is for bridges, slope protection, and transportation facilities. NT$1.5 billion is for cleaning up waste after the disaster and health recovery to prevent diseases. NT$8.9 billion is for social recovery and helping industries, including aid for farm losses and business support. Finally, NT$100 million is for setting up an office to manage the recovery and rebuilding.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that this special budget of NT$60 billion, plus NT$6.1 billion from existing budgets and urgent funds for quick relief work, and NT$3.2 billion from special shared tax funds for things like relief payments and job subsidies, means the government will spend a total of NT$69.3 billion on disaster relief and rebuilding.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho asked the Legislative Yuan for full support to pass the special budget quickly. This will help the government start all recovery and rebuilding projects as soon as possible. It will also help disaster victims rebuild their homes, fix basic services, and restart economic activities, so people's lives can return to normal quickly.</p>
