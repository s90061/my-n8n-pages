UK inflation has dropped significantly, offering some relief after a prolonged period of rising prices. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell to 3.2% in March, down from 4.0% the previous month. This is the lowest level in two and a half years, a welcome sign for households struggling with the cost of living.

Despite this positive development, inflation remains above the Bank of England's target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, also decreased but stayed relatively high. This suggests that underlying price pressures are still present in the economy.

Economists predict that inflation will continue to fall in the coming months, potentially reaching the target by the summer. However, they caution that various factors, such as global energy prices and wage growth, could influence the pace of decline. The Bank of England will carefully monitor these trends as it considers future interest rate decisions. A faster fall in inflation could lead to interest rate cuts, providing further support to the economy.

**Article 2: Innovation - New AI Tool Promises to Revolutionize Medical Diagnosis**

A team of researchers has developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that shows great promise in improving the accuracy and speed of medical diagnoses. The AI, trained on a vast dataset of medical images and patient records, can identify subtle patterns and anomalies that may be missed by human doctors.

Early trials have demonstrated the AI's ability to accurately detect various conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease, often at an earlier stage than traditional methods. This could lead to more timely and effective treatment, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.

While the AI is not intended to replace doctors, it can serve as a valuable tool to assist them in making more informed decisions. Researchers are emphasizing the importance of responsible development and deployment of AI in healthcare, ensuring that it is used ethically and effectively to improve patient outcomes. Further testing and validation are planned before the AI is widely implemented in clinical settings.

**Article 3: Travel - Greece Introduces New Measures to Combat Overtourism**

Greece is implementing new measures to manage the increasing strain of overtourism on its popular destinations. The authorities are introducing restrictions on the number of daily visitors to some of the most iconic sites, such as the Acropolis in Athens, in an effort to protect these historical landmarks.

In addition, the government is encouraging tourists to explore lesser-known regions and islands, promoting alternative destinations with their own unique charm and cultural attractions. This aims to distribute the economic benefits of tourism more evenly across the country.

The measures also include stricter regulations for short-term rental properties, such as Airbnb, in an attempt to address concerns about rising housing costs for local residents. The goal is to ensure that tourism remains sustainable and benefits both visitors and the local communities that host them.
