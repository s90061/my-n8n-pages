**Mpox Cases Go Up: 4 New Local Cases, Highest This Year, All Men in Their 30s**

Taiwan's health agency, CDC, said today that from June 24 to 30, there were 4 new local cases of Mpox (monkeypox). This is the highest number of cases in one week this year. All of them are men in their 30s. The CDC reminds people that Mpox cases usually increase in summer, so those at high risk should get vaccinated quickly.

The CDC explained that these 4 new cases are from Taipei (2 cases), New Taipei (1 case), and Tainan (1 case). All are Taiwanese men who got sick between June 17 and 23. Investigations showed that they had intimate contact with different people met through dating apps, making it hard to find where they got the infection. These people will need to manage their own health to stop the spread.

Three of the new cases had not received any Mpox vaccine. The CDC reminds people who have only had one dose to get their second dose soon for full protection. As of June 30, 99,260 people have had at least one dose of the Mpox vaccine, and 68,193 people have finished both doses. However, about 31,067 people (31%) have only had one dose.
