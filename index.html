            <h1>White House to Review National Museum System, Focusing on Historical Accuracy and Inclusivity</h1>
            <p>The White House said today that it will check some museums and shows. These places are managed by the Smithsonian Institution. This check will happen before the 250th anniversary of the US Declaration of Independence.</p>
            <p>The Smithsonian Institution is like a national museum system in other countries. The US Congress gives most of its money. But it makes its own decisions, separate from the US government. The Smithsonian's website says it runs 21 museums, 21 libraries, and the National Zoo.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that earlier this year, US President Donald Trump said the Smithsonian was spreading "anti-American ideas." This made people who support civil rights worried.</p>
            <p>Three top White House officials wrote a letter to Lonnie Bunch, who is the head of the Smithsonian. They said the review wants to make sure the Smithsonian shows the country's history correctly and includes everyone.</p>
            <p>The White House letter said: "This plan wants to follow the President's goal to celebrate American greatness. It aims to remove stories that are argued about or are not fair. It also wants to build trust again in our shared cultural places."</p>
            <p>The Smithsonian Institution sent an email saying it is looking at the letter. It will also talk with the White House and Congress in a helpful way.</p>
            <p>The letter stated that the White House will check the tone and historical stories in museum exhibits, websites, teaching materials, and online content. It will mainly look at exhibits related to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

            <h1>Changhua Man Almost Cheated Twice by Fake Lottery Win; Alert Bank Staff and Police Stop Scam</h1>
            <p>In Tianzhong Town, Changhua County, an old man was almost scammed again. A few months ago, he was cheated. Recently, he was seen walking near an ATM at the post office. A bank worker noticed something strange and called the police. They found out the man was about to lose NT$50,000 to a fake lottery win from an investment group. The bank worker and police stopped the scam.</p>
            <p>The Tianzhong Police Department in Changhua County said in a press release that police officers Xiao Hong-qi and Xu Jun-hong were on patrol. They got a call from a post office worker. The worker said an old man, who had been scammed before, was walking around the post office ATM.</p>
            <p>When the police arrived, they learned that the old man had joined a LINE investment group. A customer service person told him he had won a prize and encouraged him to join a special plan. But he first had to put NT$50,000 into a certain bank account to get his prize. Luckily, the old man did not send the money. The bank worker and police stopped the scam together.</p>
            <p>The bank worker told the police that the old man might have forgotten he was scammed this way before because he is old and his memory is not good. After the police explained, the old man suddenly understood he was almost cheated again.</p>
            <p>Today, the police told a CNA reporter that they had met a victim at this post office ATM before. This was when they were giving anti-scam information. The victim was about to send money and kept using his phone. The police felt something was wrong and went to talk to him. They then found out about the scam.</p>
            <p>Lin Ding-chao, the head of Tianzhong Police, said that new scam methods appear often. He warns people not to easily trust any information online or on social media that promises easy money from investments. If you have any questions, you can call the 165 anti-scam hotline or the 110 police hotline.</p>

            <h1>Veterans Affairs Council Announces Rules to Restore Education Subsidies for Children of Retired Colonels and Above</h1>
            <p>On June 13, the Legislative Yuan passed a change to the Act for Assisting Retired Servicemen. This change brings back education money for children of retired colonels and higher ranks. The Veterans Affairs Council (VAC) recently announced a new draft rule. It is called "Rules for Giving Education Money to Children of Retired Servicemen Who Receive Pensions, Alimony, and Living Allowances." This rule will complete the legal basis for the subsidy.</p>
            <p>The Directorate-General of Personnel Administration (DGPA) said in July 2017 that from August 1, 2017, education money for children of retired military, government, and school workers changed. Only those whose monthly pension was less than NT$25,000 (for government and school workers) or those who retired as lieutenant colonels or lower (for military) could get it. The VAC has been trying for a long time to bring back this education money for children of retired colonels and higher ranks.</p>
            <p>Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers suggested changes to the Act for Assisting Retired Servicemen. On June 10, the Legislative Yuan passed these changes. They added Article 27-2. This new article says that retired servicemen who get a pension, alimony, or living allowance can get education money for their children. The VAC will set the rules for this money with the Ministry of Education. President Lai Ching-te announced this new article on June 27.</p>
            <p>To go with the new Article 27-2 in the Act for Assisting Retired Servicemen, the VAC announced the draft "Rules for Giving Education Money to Children of Retired Servicemen Who Receive Pensions, Alimony, and Living Allowances" on August 7.</p>
            <p>The VAC said this is an important policy for them. It affects the rights of retired servicemen and will help them. So, it needs to be put into action quickly. Because of this, the public notice period for the draft rule was shortened to 7 days. If anyone has comments or ideas for changes to the draft, they need to share them before August 14.</p>
            <p>The rules clearly state who can apply for the education money for children. It is for retired servicemen who get a pension, alimony, or living allowance, and whose children live and study in Taiwan. The VAC will announce how much money will be given. If a person applying for the subsidy pays less than the announced amount for school fees, they will get the exact amount they paid.</p>
            <p>The rules also state when the education money for children will not be given. This is if the applicant does not get a pension, alimony, or living allowance. Also, if their children do not live in Taiwan, study in the right schools, or if the schooling time is longer than allowed, they will not get the money. The rules say that this new system will start on August 1, 2025.</p>
