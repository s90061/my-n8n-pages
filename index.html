URL: https://www.reuters.com/technology/gen-zs-digital-search-habits-dont-google-it-tiktok-it-2024-05-23/

Younger generations, often called Gen Z, are changing the way people find information online. Instead of using traditional search engines like Google, many now prefer social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram. These apps offer a different experience because they show information through short videos and personalized content.

People from Gen Z often feel that videos from other users on social media are more real and helpful than text-based search results. For example, if they want to find a good restaurant, they might watch a TikTok video of someone reviewing a place rather than just reading written reviews. This trend means that companies and businesses need to think differently about how they reach young customers. They might need to create more video content or work with social media influencers to share their messages. This shift shows how quickly digital habits can change.

**Work: AI is Changing the Job Market**

Companies are putting more money into Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which is starting to change the job market. While some people worry that AI might take away jobs, experts say it's actually creating many new types of roles. Businesses are looking for new employees who understand AI and can help use these tools in their work.

For example, there is growing demand for AI specialists, data scientists, and people who can manage AI systems. Companies also need workers who can use AI tools to improve their own jobs, like marketing professionals who use AI to analyze customer data. This means that learning new skills related to AI will be important for many people in the future. Instead of simply replacing human workers, AI is changing the skills needed for many jobs and creating exciting new career paths.

**Travel: Holiday Costs Are Rising This Summer**

Many people planning holidays this summer might find that prices are higher than before. The cost of flights, hotels, and holiday packages has increased, making it more expensive to travel. This is partly because more people want to go on holiday after recent years of restrictions, and also because general living costs are going up.

As a result, popular tourist destinations are also expected to be very crowded. This means travellers might have to book their trips much earlier to get good prices or to find availability in their preferred places. Experts suggest that holidaymakers should plan carefully and consider less famous destinations if they want to save money or avoid large crowds. Traveling during off-peak times could also be a way to enjoy a holiday without spending too much.`;
