A typhoon is coming, and because of this, the civil service high-level exam that was supposed to happen on July 6th is now moved to a later date. This decision was made because two cities, Tainan and Kaohsiung, announced that they will close schools and offices on July 6th.

The exam usually takes place in 16 different areas, but if even one area cannot hold the exam, then all areas must stop the exam. So, the first day of the exam, July 6th, will not happen as planned. The new date for the exam will be announced later.

The government also said that they will watch the typhoon closely. They will let people know about any more changes to the exam schedule. They also told people taking the exam to be careful because of the weather and traffic. If someone cannot take the exam because it was moved or because of travel problems, they can ask for their registration fee back within 15 days after the exam was supposed to happen.

**Typhoon Darts Approaching: Penghu to Close on July 6th Afternoon**

The Penghu County government announced tonight that due to Typhoon Darts, schools and offices in Penghu will be closed from 12 PM on July 6th. This decision was made because the Central Weather Bureau said that Penghu is in the typhoon's warning area.

The Penghu County government stated that the typhoon is expected to bring strong winds, with average winds of 9 units and gusts over 11 units, in the afternoon on July 6th. To keep everyone safe, work and school will stop after 12 PM on July 6th. Locals are reminded to get ready for the typhoon.

**Financial Watchdog Asks Insurance Companies to Help Customers During Typhoon Darts**

As Typhoon Darts gets closer to Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has asked insurance companies to get ready and help their customers. The FSC wants insurance companies to check their offices to make sure they are safe from the typhoon. They also want companies to reach out to customers to see if they have any damage and pay claims quickly based on their insurance agreements.

The FSC also told people to check their insurance policies to see if they are covered for damage from typhoons or floods. For example, basic home insurance only gives a little bit of protection for typhoon and flood damage. The FSC suggests that people buy extra insurance if they need more coverage for these types of natural disasters.

For car insurance, regular plans like Type A, B, or C do not cover damage from typhoons or floods. It is a good idea to add extra coverage for these events if you want full protection for your car. If people have damage from the typhoon, they can contact their insurance company to make a claim. If they have questions about their claims, they can call their insurance company or use the free helplines provided by the insurance associations.
