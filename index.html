            <h1>US Emory University Shooting: 1 Injured, Gunman Dead, CDC Building Hit</h1>
            <p>Police in the United States said that a gunman was active near the Emory University campus in Georgia today. After police were called and arrived, the gunman died, and a police officer was hurt during the event. The CDC building, which is next to the university, was hit by bullets.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that this shooting happened near the entrance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Several CDC employees said that several bullets hit the windows of the CDC building.</p>
            <p>Emory University in Atlanta announced on social media platform X that the order to stay inside had been lifted. However, they still asked people to stay away from that area.</p>
            <p>Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said, "We are shocked by the news from Emory University and are praying for the safety of everyone in the university community."</p>
            <p>A deli near Emory University locked its doors because of the incident and had people shelter inside. Brandy Giraldo, the manager of the deli, said that employees inside heard a series of gunshots.</p>
            <p>She said, "It sounded like fireworks going off again and again."</p>

            <h1>Wu Der-rong: Typhoon Willow's Chance of Hitting Taiwan Drops, May Weaken and Disappear Halfway</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow was expected to pass through the Bashi Channel. However, weather expert Wu Der-rong said today that European weather models now show it passing north of Taiwan on August 13 and 14. Because it will move into an area with strong winds at different heights, it might weaken or even disappear halfway. This reduces its chance of hitting Taiwan to 20% to 30%.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Administration's website, the center of weak Typhoon Willow was 2280 kilometers east of Taipei at 2 AM. It is moving northwest and then west at a speed of 13 to 19 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, who is also an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column "Heaven's Secrets Classroom" that the newest European model (ECMWF) shows the average path for Typhoon Willow has changed. It is now expected to pass north of Taiwan on August 13 and 14. The individual paths from the model runs are quite spread out. The model also shows more members weakening or even disappearing because the typhoon will enter an area with strong winds at different heights.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that the newest European model's "map showing the chance of the storm hitting" shows that Willow's chance of hitting has dropped slightly to 20% to 30%. He added that because weather models from different countries are still changing, whether Willow will directly hit Taiwan is still uncertain, and we need to watch it closely.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration has sent out a high temperature warning. Today, Taipei City, New Taipei City, Tainan City, and Pingtung County are under an orange warning, meaning temperatures might stay at 36 degrees Celsius. Keelung City and Hualien County are under a yellow warning, meaning temperatures might go above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the European model shows high pressure from the Pacific Ocean will affect Taiwan today. This means it will be sunny and very hot everywhere, with strong UV rays. People need to protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. In the afternoon, there might be small, short rains in the mountain areas.</p>
            <p>For temperatures, Wu Der-rong said the north will be 23 to 38 degrees Celsius, the central area 24 to 36 degrees Celsius, the south 25 to 37 degrees Celsius, and the east 23 to 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also said that from tomorrow until August 12, it will still be sunny and hot everywhere. People should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. There will be a little more moisture from the south, and the weather will become unstable. In the afternoon, there will be a chance of local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains, and these might spread to some flat areas.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong mentioned that from August 13 to 15, there will be more moisture in the air. However, the weather everywhere will depend on how strong Typhoon Willow is and where it goes, so we need to watch it more.</p>

            <h1>Financial Times: US Issues Licenses, Allows Nvidia to Export H20 Chips to China</h1>
            <p>The Financial Times reported today that the US Department of Commerce has started giving licenses to big AI chip company Nvidia. These licenses allow Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China. This happened after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Trump at the White House.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times quoted US officials saying that the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, which watches over sales to other countries, has begun giving out these H20 chip licenses.</p>
            <p>Nvidia made the H20 chips especially for the Chinese market. This was to follow the rules about selling AI chips that former US President Biden made.</p>
            <p>Last month, the US lifted a ban from April this year that stopped Nvidia from selling H20 chips to China.</p>
            <p>Nvidia said in July that it asked the US government to let them sell H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to China again. They were told by the US that they would get the licenses soon.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times reported that President Trump lifted the April limits after Jensen Huang visited the White House and talked directly to Trump. But Nvidia felt frustrated because the Trump government was slow to give out the licenses after making the decision.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times, quoting people who know about it, reported that Jensen Huang visited the White House again on August 6 to meet with Trump. Two days later, the Department of Commerce started giving out the licenses.</p>
            <p>Last month, Nvidia said that its products do not have hidden ways for others to get in or control them. This statement came after China worried about possible safety problems with Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Nvidia did not want to say anything about this. The US Department of Commerce has not answered Reuters' request for comments.</p>
