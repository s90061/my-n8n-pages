            <h1>Vance: Russia-Ukraine Peace Deal Unlikely to Please Both Sides; US Continues Talks</h1>
            <p>US Vice President JD Vance said that even if Russia and Ukraine make a peace agreement, it probably won't make either country happy. Both Russia and Ukraine might be "unhappy" with the final deal.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that the United States wants to help the two countries find a solution they can both agree on.</p>
            <p>Vance spoke on a TV show called "Sunday Morning Futures" on Fox News. He said, "This won't make everyone very happy. In the end, both Russia and Ukraine might be unhappy with what happens."</p>
            <p>US President Trump said on August 8 that he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska. They will talk about ending the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Trump said that Russia and Ukraine could quickly agree to end the 3.5-year conflict. He also said that Ukraine might have to give up a lot of its land.</p>
            <p>But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday that Ukraine cannot give up its land. He said, "Ukrainians will not give their land to those who took it."</p>
            <p>In the interview recorded on August 8, Vance said that the US is trying to set up a meeting with Putin, Zelenskyy, and Trump. However, he believes it would not work well if Putin met Zelenskyy before meeting Trump.</p>
            <p>White House officials said late yesterday that Trump is open to meeting both leaders. But right now, the White House is preparing for a meeting between only Trump and Putin, as Putin suggested.</p>

            <h1>Children's Health Checks May Increase to 9 Times, Could Start in 2026</h1>
            <p>The National Health Administration wants to get over 100 million New Taiwan Dollars. They plan to add two more health checks for children, changing the total from 7 to 9 times. They are thinking about adding one check for babies between 4 and 10 months old. They also want to add one check for children between 3 and 7 years old. These changes could start as early as 2026.</p>
            <p>Shen Ching-fen is the new head of the National Health Administration, part of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. She started her job on August 1st and held her first meeting with reporters today.</p>
            <p>She used to work as a doctor who studied children's infections. She was also a member of a group called the Health Taiwan Promotion Committee. She said she talks with people every day to have new ideas and to reach the goal of a healthy Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Shen Ching-fen has left the Health Taiwan Promotion Committee, but she still cares most about the health of mothers and children. She said they will continue to make it easier to get help for problems with having babies. She will also keep caring for new mothers' body and mind health. The child health checks might increase from 7 times to 9 times. This is to help keep children healthy.</p>
            <p>Wei Hsi-lun, who is a deputy head at the National Health Administration, explained more. They are thinking about adding more child health checks. One extra check would be for babies who are 4 to 10 months old. Also, children aged 3 to 7 years currently only have one check-up. They hope to add another one for them too. This will make the checks happen more often. The money needed for this might be more than 100 million New Taiwan Dollars. They still need to get this money. If they get the money, they hope to start the new plan next year.</p>
            <p>Currently, children get health checks at different times: within 6 days after birth, from birth to 2 months, 2 to 4 months, 4 to 10 months, 10 months to 1 and a half years, 1 and a half years to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, and from 3 years to under 7 years.</p>
            <p>During these checks, doctors look for different things. For example, they test for problems babies are born with, check their hearing, and measure their height, weight, and head size. They also check if the child is getting enough food, and look for health issues like a hernia or problems with hip movement.</p>
            <p>As children grow, doctors also check their development. This includes seeing if they can roll over, grab things, hear sounds well, take a cloth off their face, crawl, stand up with help, wave goodbye, make "ba" and "ma" sounds, walk, hold a cup, copy actions, say single words, understand what people say, use their body to show things, share interesting items, and use everyday objects as toys.</p>

            <h1>Philippine President: Taiwan Strait Comments Just Facts, China's "Playing with Fire" Claim Not Understood</h1>
            <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. recently said that if there is a fight in the Taiwan Strait, the Philippines cannot stay out of it. China was unhappy about this. Today, President Marcos Jr. held a meeting with reporters. He said he was just telling the truth and does not understand why China is complaining.</p>
            <p>Last week, President Marcos Jr. visited India. He told a news company there that if a conflict starts in the Taiwan Strait, the Philippines would have to be involved.</p>
            <p>China's Foreign Ministry put out a statement on August 8. It said that the Philippines was wrong about the "One China principle" and that this hurt the friendship between China and the Philippines. China told the Philippines to follow the One China principle and the agreement they made when they started their relationship. China also warned the Philippines not to "play with fire" on issues that are very important to China.</p>
            <p>Today, at the presidential palace in the Philippines, Marcos Jr. talked to reporters. He answered by saying, "I don't know what they are talking about. Playing with fire? I am just saying what is true."</p>
            <p>He made it clear that the Philippines does not want to fight. However, he believes that if a war starts in Taiwan, the Philippines will be part of it no matter what. So, they need to plan, especially how to get Filipinos living in Taiwan to safety and how to protect their own land.</p>
            <p>President Marcos Jr. said again that even though the Philippines does not want a fight with any country, if a war begins in Taiwan, they will certainly be involved. He said, "That is what I wanted to say. That is why I do not understand why some people say the Philippines is playing with fire or trying to cause trouble."</p>
            <p>Also, regarding Chinese warships and coast guard ships that keep going into parts of the South China Sea that the Philippines says are theirs, Marcos Jr. repeated that he has no new orders. He just wants the government departments to keep patrolling the South China Sea and protecting their land as before.</p>
            <p>Angelito Banayo, who used to represent the Philippines in Taiwan, recently told CNA news agency that if a war starts in the Taiwan Strait, it would be hard for the Philippines to stay out. This is not only because of how close they are, but also because the United States has three military bases in the northern Philippines. These bases were built as part of an agreement called the "Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement" (EDCA). All these bases face Taiwan and are aimed at China.</p>
            <p>If a war happens, China might attack these bases.</p>
            <p>Banayo said that what President Marcos Jr. said in India was a practical talk about keeping the 200,000 Filipinos in Taiwan safe. He said it does not mean the Philippines is changing its "One China policy."</p>
            <p>Lucio Pitlo III, a researcher from a Philippine group called the Asia Pacific Pathways to Progress Foundation (APPFI), also said that China will surely be upset by Marcos Jr.'s words. But he also said that the Philippines can make its own choices about foreign affairs.</p>
            <p>Pitlo also said that countries in Southeast Asia might ask the Philippines for help to get their citizens out of Taiwan and give them a safe place for a short time. These are some difficult problems the Philippines might have to deal with.</p>
