Microsoft recently shared findings about how its artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like Copilot, are changing the way people work. The company tested these tools with thousands of its own employees. The results show a mixed picture: some workers found AI greatly improved their productivity, while others did not see such big changes.

One key discovery is that AI's usefulness often depends on the person's job. Employees who spend a lot of time writing, coding, or analysing data reported the biggest benefits. For example, software developers found that AI helped them write code faster. Marketing teams used AI to quickly create new content. These workers felt more productive and less stressed.

However, other employees, especially those in roles that involve more direct human interaction or physical tasks, found AI less helpful. Microsoft also noted that simply giving employees AI tools is not enough. Proper training and understanding of how to use AI effectively are crucial for it to be truly beneficial. The company believes that over time, as both AI tools and user skills develop, more workers will experience significant improvements.

**Challenges Emerge in Making the Four-Day Work Week Permanent**

Many companies around the world have been trying out a four-day work week, where employees work fewer days for the same pay. While initial trials often show positive results like increased happiness and productivity, new challenges are appearing as businesses try to make this change permanent.

One major difficulty is adapting the four-day week to all types of jobs and industries. It works well for office-based roles, but sectors like healthcare, retail, and manufacturing find it much harder. For example, hospitals need staff around the clock, and shops need to be open when customers want to buy things. This often means hiring more people, which can be expensive.

Another challenge is managing the workload within four days. Some employees feel they have to squeeze five days of work into four, leading to higher stress levels. Managers also need special training to lead teams that work fewer days, ensuring tasks are still completed efficiently. Businesses are learning that a successful four-day week needs careful planning, clear communication, and flexibility to fit different company needs.

**Climate Change is Reshaping Summer Travel Experiences**

Summer travel, especially in popular European destinations, is becoming increasingly difficult and unpredictable due to rising global temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events. Heatwaves, often reaching dangerous levels, are no longer rare occurrences. This is forcing tourists and the travel industry to rethink how they plan summer holidays.

Many famous places, like cities in southern Europe, are experiencing heat that makes sightseeing uncomfortable and sometimes unhealthy. This intense heat can also cause problems for transport, leading to flight delays or cancellations. Beyond heatwaves, other extreme weather events such as wildfires and severe storms are also impacting travel routes and safety.

As a result, some travellers are changing their habits. They might choose to visit destinations during cooler months, or pick places known for milder climates. There's also a growing interest in less crowded, more nature-focused holidays. The travel industry is starting to adapt, for example, by promoting evening activities in hot areas or investing in cooler indoor attractions. The aim is to ensure that future summer holidays can still be enjoyable and safe, even with a changing climate.`;
