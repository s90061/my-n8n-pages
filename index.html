            <h1>Vietnam's Leader Visits North Korea: Experts Say It Shows Vietnam Is Not a "Political Satellite" of US or China</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Hanoi, October 12) Vietnamese Communist Party leader, Tô Lâm, visited North Korea and met Kim Jong Un. This was the first time a Vietnamese leader visited Pyongyang in 17 years. Experts say that Vietnam uses a "practical hedging" way of doing foreign policy. They want to become more important in global talks. This visit showed that Vietnam does not let Washington control its foreign policy. It also showed that Vietnam is not a "political satellite" of China. This shows its independence, which makes Japan and South Korea feel more at ease.</p>
            <p>Tô Lâm, the leader of Vietnam's Communist Party, visited South Korea in August this year and met President Lee Jae-myung. Two months later, from October 9th to 11th, he visited North Korea and met its top leader, Kim Jong Un. This was the first visit by a Vietnamese leader to Pyongyang in almost 20 years.</p>
            <p>On October 10th, both sides signed agreements to work together on many things. These included defense, culture, health, air travel, legal help, making investments easier, and avoiding double taxes. So far, the two countries do not trade with each other.</p>
            <p>This year is 75 years since the two countries started working together. Tô Lâm was asked to join the 80th anniversary party of North Korea's Workers' Party. Experts say Vietnam is one of the few countries that can be friends with both North and South Korean leaders at the same time. This visit got a lot of attention from global experts.</p>
            <p>On October 10th, an article on the European English news website "Modern Diplomacy" said that most countries stay away from Pyongyang because of international rules. But Vietnam chose to visit North Korean leaders. This is not a normal diplomatic action. It "can only be seen as a smart move." By doing this, Vietnam wants to send a message to important countries. This happens as countries in Asia are competing for power.</p>
            <p>The article also said that for the United States, Vietnam sent a message that "Washington will not control all of Vietnam's foreign policy." But at the same time, Vietnam will not break the United Nations' rules about North Korea's nuclear weapons. Vietnam keeps enough distance from big countries. This is to keep its own foreign policy and be able to change it when needed.</p>
            <p>The message sent to China is more complex. North Korea, China, and Vietnam are all socialist countries. On the surface, it looks like they share similar ideas and friendship.</p>
            <p>But a deeper meaning is that Vietnam wants to tell Beijing that "Vietnam is an independent partner, not a 'political satellite' of China." Vietnam wants to break through China's influence. It wants to keep friendly ties through party-to-party talks. This is to make sure it has its own political space among socialist countries.</p>
            <p>Also, the visit can be seen as Vietnam sending a "strategic balance" message to Beijing. Because of the sea territory problems between Vietnam and China, "Vietnam is showing that its foreign policy is not only for Southeast Asia. It also reaches Northeast Asia. Even in places where China shows its power, Vietnam can and wants to speak its mind."</p>
            <p>Because Russia and North Korea are becoming closer, some people thought Vietnam's foreign policy was leaning towards Russia. But Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in South Korea, said, "Vietnam keeps a necessary distance so it is not pulled into any political or military groups. The cooperation between Vietnam and North Korea is mainly based on old friendships and party talks. It is not connected to Russia's plans."</p>
            <p>North Korea has always been a threat to South Korea and Japan. South Korea and Japan are very important for Vietnam's economy and trade. South Korea invests the most money directly into Vietnam from other countries. Tô Lâm recently signed a $250 million arms deal with Seoul. Japan gives a lot of official development aid (ODA) to Vietnam. It greatly helps Vietnam with its buildings and changing to green energy.</p>
            <p>So, Vietnam's visit to North Korea might make Japan and South Korea feel better. "Hanoi wants to show that being better friends with Pyongyang will not hurt its interests or cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo. Instead, it could open a way for indirect talks. This could help make things less tense in the area."</p>
            <p>The Interpreter, a website of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, also wrote about Tô Lâm's visit on October 8th. The article was called "Vietnam is getting closer to North Korea and still winning Western friends." The writer also thinks that if Pyongyang continues to avoid talks with Seoul, "Hanoi might even act as a mediator in diplomatic talks."</p>
            <p>Some experts call Vietnam's way of doing foreign policy "practical hedging." This means being able to keep good, balanced relationships with different countries that might not like each other. At the same time, Vietnam does not rely on any single country.</p>
            <p>"Modern Diplomacy" pointed out that by visiting Pyongyang, Vietnam used party-to-party talks to build trust. At the same time, it continued to improve its country-to-country talks with big capitalist countries.</p>

            <h1>18 Feared Dead After Explosion at Tennessee Explosives Factory; Bodies Need DNA Testing</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, October 11) Officials said today that a large explosion happened at a factory in Tennessee, USA, that makes explosives. It is believed that 18 people died.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that Chris Davis, the sheriff of Humphreys County, said in a press conference, "We can assume they have died." He was talking about the 18 people who have been missing since the explosion in Bucksnort town on October 10th.</p>
            <p>The factory, run by Accurate Energetic Systems, makes explosives for military use and for breaking things apart.</p>
            <p>News reports said that the explosion destroyed a whole building at the factory. Homes many miles away felt the ground shake, and pieces of the building were scattered everywhere.</p>
            <p>Davis said that DNA tests will be used to identify the bodies. He also said, "But because of the condition of the site, we have to work slowly."</p>
            <p>Accurate Energetic Systems said in a statement that the explosion was "a sad accident."</p>
            <p>But Davis said, "I cannot answer if we can rule out murder. It might take days, weeks, or months."</p>
            <p>He said that many federal agencies, including the FBI, have sent people to the explosion site to help with the investigation.</p>

            <h1>Border Fights Increase Between Pakistan and Afghanistan; Both Countries Exchange Fire</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Islamabad, October 11) Tonight, many parts of the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan had a lot of shooting. Afghan Taliban soldiers attacked Pakistani checkpoints. Pakistani security officials said that Pakistan is "fighting back with full force."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Pakistani security officials said Afghanistan started attacks without a reason. Both sides were fighting in more than 6 places along the border.</p>
            <p>Afghan Taliban forces said they took over three Pakistani border checkpoints. Pakistani security officials, however, said that the Pakistani military destroyed many Afghan checkpoints.</p>
            <p>Videos from Pakistan's security forces showed soldiers firing guns and cannons into Afghanistan. The flashes of light lit up the night sky.</p>
            <p>Pakistan had recently attacked Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, from the air. Because of this, a spokesperson for Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense said today's actions were a response to Pakistan entering Afghan airspace. The spokesperson also said the attacks ended at midnight local time.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson warned, "If the other side enters Afghan airspace again, our armed forces are ready to protect our sky. We will respond strongly."</p>
            <p>Pakistan has not yet said if the fighting has stopped. The border between the two countries is 2600 kilometers long.</p>
            <p>Pakistan said that the Afghan Taliban government, with help from India, is hiding "Pakistani Taliban" fighters. Pakistan claims these fighters are allowed to attack Pakistan from Afghanistan. India said these claims are not true. The Afghan Taliban firmly stated that they will not let their land be used to attack other countries.</p>
            <p>Earlier, a Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan's air attack was aimed at a Pakistani Taliban leader who was in a car in Kabul. But it is not clear yet if this person is still alive. Pakistan has warned the Afghan Taliban government that its patience has run out.</p>
