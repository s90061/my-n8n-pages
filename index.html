            <h1>BlackRock and NVIDIA Teams Lead Investment in AI Data Center, Acquire Aligned for NT$1.2 Trillion</h1>
            <p>A group of investors, including BlackRock and NVIDIA, announced that they will buy Aligned Data Centers for 40 billion US dollars. This is about 1.224 trillion New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>This big deal happened because AI technology is growing fast. Many companies want to get expensive and hard-to-find data centers to support AI.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this purchase shows how quickly big companies around the world are setting up large AI computer systems. They are trying to get the main resources needed to train AI models like ChatGPT. OpenAI, which made ChatGPT, recently announced several agreements to get about 26 gigawatts (26 billion watts) of computing power. This is enough electricity for about 20 million American homes.</p>
            <p>The investment group is called "AI Infrastructure Partnership" (AIP). They plan to put in 30 billion US dollars of their own money first. The total investment might reach 100 billion US dollars, including loans. This is the first investment for AIP. The deal is expected to be finished in the first half of 2026.</p>
            <p>Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock and head of AIP, said, "We are investing in Aligned Data Centers to achieve our goal of providing the infrastructure for the future of AI."</p>
            <p>Other important investors in the AIP group include xAI, owned by Elon Musk, Microsoft, the Kuwait Investment Authority (Kuwait's state fund), and Temasek (Singapore's state investment company).</p>
            <p>Aligned designs, builds, and runs data centers for large cloud companies, new cloud companies, and other businesses. Their current properties include 50 areas, with more than 5 gigawatts of power already working or being planned. This includes new projects in parts of the United States and Latin America. The company's main office will stay in Dallas, Texas, USA. CEO Andrew Schaap will continue to lead the company.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the popularity of AI has greatly increased the need for money to build large data centers. Earlier this year, Aligned raised 12 billion US dollars, one of the biggest amounts in the industry. But as the market continues to demand more, the amount of money being raised is still growing.</p>
            <p>To meet the needs of AI infrastructure, big technology companies, new companies, private investors, and infrastructure funds have already spent hundreds of billions of US dollars. Last week, OpenAI announced a deal with AMD to get 6 gigawatts of AI chips and the option to buy more company shares. Before that, it was said that NVIDIA planned to invest up to 100 billion US dollars in OpenAI and provide at least 10 gigawatts of data center systems.</p>
            <p>Morgan Stanley believes that big cloud companies like Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft, and Coreweave will quickly invest 400 billion US dollars in AI infrastructure this year alone.</p>
            <p>Even though some people are worried about whether these huge investments will make enough money, big tech companies say they will keep spending more on building data centers. Recently, many connected investments have happened in the AI industry, which makes some people wonder if the market is seeing a cycle of investments.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA has often been a main investor in AI deals recently. NVIDIA is also the world's biggest maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) and is a leader in the market.</p>

            <h1>Forum 2000: Former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Asia Pacific Says US Strategy Must Include Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Mark Lambert, who used to be a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Asia Pacific at the US Department of State, said at the "Forum 2000" in the Czech Republic on October 13 that America's plan must have a strong "Taiwan strategy." He explained that if China blocks Taiwan, the global economy could lose trillions of US dollars, and Europe would also be affected. He said, "The way to stop China from growing is to work together with other countries."</p>
            <p>The 29th "Forum 2000" was held in Prague, Czech Republic, from October 12 to 14. Mark Lambert was invited to a discussion called "China: When Will the Expansion Stop?" He shared ideas with experts from Taiwan, Japan, Tibet, and Africa about how to deal with China's influence and threats.</p>
            <p>Mark Lambert used to work as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Asia Pacific at the US Department of State. He led the Taiwan Coordination Office under the East Asia Bureau and has a lot of experience in Asia. He worked twice at the US Embassy in Beijing, where he managed political and military matters between the US and China. He also worked in Hanoi, Bangkok, and Tokyo.</p>
            <h2>America's Indo-Pacific Strategy: Working Closely with Friends</h2>
            <p>At the forum, Mark Lambert said that even during the first Trump administration, China tried to change how international groups and organizations worked and what they meant.</p>
            <p>He gave an example: "China promoted something called 'win-win.' But in their way of thinking, this really means: we only talk about things we both agree on, like trade and investment. We avoid sensitive topics like human rights, Xinjiang, and Tibet."</p>
            <p>He said that one important task for the US government back then was to make other countries aware of China's actions, to stop China from controlling international rules. This effort continued during the Biden administration and became part of a bigger plan called the "Indo-Pacific Strategy."</p>
            <p>Mark Lambert stressed that this is a wider plan because the Indo-Pacific area is very important for America's economy, safety, and political interests.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that America's analysis shows that only China has enough diplomatic, economic, and military power to completely change the international order that was set up after World War II. If nothing is done to stop it, China might actually succeed.</p>
            <p>Mark Lambert remembered that when they made the Indo-Pacific strategy, the US government decided to stop different government departments from working separately. This was to deal with China's many challenges. "In the past, economists only looked at economics, trade officials only talked about trade, security experts only cared about the military, and human rights officials only talked about human rights. We need to look at China's issues more broadly."</p>
            <p>America also works closely with friends like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the European Union. They all have their own versions of the Indo-Pacific strategy and ways to understand the challenges.</p>
            <p>He said that in the new relationship between Moscow and Beijing, China is the main leader. "Without China's economic help, Russia's actions against Ukraine could not continue."</p>
            <h2>America's Strategy Must Include Taiwan and Show Its Global Importance</h2>
            <p>Talking about big challenges in the world, Mark Lambert said, "At sea, China is trying to make the South China Sea its own 'China lake.' It also wants to control the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, making these areas like inland waters. On land, the clearest goal is Taiwan."</p>
            <p>He said that America's plan must have a strong "Taiwan strategy." This means helping people worldwide understand "why Taiwan is important." Mark Lambert emphasized: "Taiwan is America's eighth-largest trading partner. If China blocks Taiwan, the global economy could lose trillions of US dollars. Many European countries are surprised when they learn that they would also be badly affected. So, making people aware is very important."</p>
            <p>Mark Lambert believes that technology is the most important battleground today. China has clearly stated that it wants to lead the world in areas like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors, and biotechnology. These technologies can be used for military purposes and become new, very destructive powers.</p>
            <p>He said that America uses a strategy called "small yard, high fence." This means: "Even though we trade a lot with China, we will never help China get ahead in technology areas that could be used against us. This requires America to make industrial policies and coordinate actions in a way not often seen since World War II."</p>
            <p>He also warned that China gives money to hundreds of electric car makers. Now, these companies make good quality electric cars. "If there are no protections, these cars could destroy the car industries in Japan, South Korea, Europe, and North America. This would cause millions of jobs to be lost worldwide."</p>
            <h2>China Avoids Human Rights Issues, Lambert Calls for Unity Among Countries</h2>
            <p>Regarding China's internal problems, Mark Lambert pointed out that the situations in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong are still very serious. He stressed that companies should make sure their supply chains do not use forced labor. "If European companies process tomatoes grown in Xinjiang, they must check that forced laborers did not pick them. Otherwise, these products cannot be sold in the United States."</p>
            <p>He said that as the Dalai Lama gets older, China has started planning who will take his place. "This is not just about stability in Tibet; it could also affect Mongolia, Central Asia, and parts of Russia."</p>
            <p>Mark Lambert said that America is also watching Hong Kong and how Chinese security agents are sent to other countries to threaten people who speak against the government. "I myself have seen this happen in the San Francisco Bay Area, and my European friends have also seen it in places like Germany and Switzerland."</p>
            <p>Mark Lambert emphasized that in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, America and its friends must offer help for development and other ways to get important resources that are not from China. For example, food security and mineral resources.</p>
            <p>He said that America has real experts on China around the world. They act like "traveling teachers," helping to train staff in different embassies and sharing experiences with friendly countries. However, Mark Lambert is also worried about the current situation. He plainly said, "Right now, there is no clear strategy for China in Washington D.C."</p>
            <p>Even so, Mark Lambert remains hopeful. America might no longer be the only leader, but it will work together with Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Europe. "The only way to make China stop expanding is if we all stand together," he concluded.</p>

            <h1>Lin Tai-hua Shows 4 Big Boxes of Documents to Prove Her Innocence; Green Party Ethics Committee Still Has No Decision</h1>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was accused of taking money meant for assistant salaries. She was charged in court. Today, October 15, she brought four large boxes of documents to the DPP's Ethics Committee to explain her side again. She said that the prosecutor purposely did not include evidence that would help her case. She hopes for a fair primary election for the Kaohsiung mayor position. After the meeting, Qiu Jun-yan, the head of the DPP Ethics Committee, said that the committee still could not make a decision today. They will see if there is any new information before their next regular meeting.</p>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua and others were found to have taken more than NT$14 million from assistant salaries. In June, prosecutors in Kaohsiung charged nine people. Prosecutors also found that Lin Tai-hua's sister helped to falsely report more than NT$320,000, with a monthly salary sometimes as high as NT$130,000. Today, new charges were added for her sister, for corruption and other crimes.</p>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua had explained her situation to the DPP Ethics Committee in late July, but at that time, the committee could not make a decision and asked her for more detailed proof. The Ethics Committee met again today to discuss the case. Lin Tai-hua arrived at the committee in the evening with four big boxes of documents. She spoke for more than 1.5 hours.</p>
            <p>Qiu Jun-yan said after the meeting that Lin Tai-hua's lawyers prepared over 600 pages of statements. Although they presented many reasons that help her case, the situation is very broad and needs more checking. Also, the Ethics Committee asked about the charges against Lin Tai-hua's sister and how they relate to the assistant salary case. Since the charges against her sister were filed just this morning, they haven't even seen the official charge document yet, so Lin Tai-hua could not explain everything.</p>
            <p>Qiu Jun-yan said that the prosecutor is still investigating the political donation case, and they don't know when new information will come out. The Ethics Committee decided that "they still cannot make a decision today and will see if there is any new progress before the next regular meeting."</p>
            <p>Reporters asked about the upcoming primary election. However, Qiu Jun-yan said, "We never consider the primary election issue because that would make our position unfair." But since Lin Tai-hua is a well-known public figure, if they are to make a decision against her, the evidence must be very clear. "Currently, it has not reached that level." Regarding when Lin Tai-hua will be asked to explain again, Qiu Jun-yan said the date has not been set yet, and it will depend on how the case develops.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Lin Tai-hua released a statement. She said she respects the legal process and will fully cooperate to find out the truth. She stands by her values of being honest, hardworking, and caring for her community. She asked everyone to trust that she is innocent.</p>
            <p>She stated that after her lawyers read the case documents, they found that the prosecutor used evidence against her that was unfair and incorrect. Many pieces of evidence that would help her were purposely left out. She said she could not share the details outside of court. She asked media interested in the case to attend the Kaohsiung District Court on October 27 to understand the situation.</p>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua said her sister, Lin Tai-zhen, has helped with 1,875 public service cases since 2002. She worked very hard. When there was not enough staff for public assistants, her sister took on all the extra work, and her salary was adjusted. This is a legal duty. "My sister has been an assistant for more than 20 years, and she is accused of taking about NT$300,000. Do you think this makes sense?"</p>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua said that the media reported her sister received NT$130,000 every month, but actually, it was only for one month in 20 years. Her sister worked day and night, 24 hours a day, without weekends or national holidays, and even during Chinese New Year. She showed photos to prove that "almost everywhere I appeared in Kaohsiung City, my sister was there. Everyone in Kaohsiung knows this, only the investigators do not. They even said my sister was a fake assistant."</p>
            <p>Lin Tai-hua hopes the truth will be clear soon. She also hopes that Kaohsiung citizens will have a fair primary election process for the 2026 Kaohsiung mayoral race within the Democratic Progressive Party.</p>
            <p>In other news, the DPP Ethics Committee also discussed the case of former New Taipei City DPP Deputy Speaker Chen Wen-chih, who was accused of taking money for assistant salaries. Qiu Jun-yan said that Chen Wen-chih was found guilty in the first trial. The Ethics Committee decided to suspend his party rights for three years.</p>
