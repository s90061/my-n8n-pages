            <h1>Hideki Kuriyama Praises Lin An-Ko's Hitting Skills, Wants to See Taiwan's Good Players</h1>
            <p>Hideki Kuriyama, a top baseball official from Japan's Nippon-Ham Fighters team, was in Taiwan. Yesterday, he went to Tianmu to watch Wei Chuan Dragons pitcher Hsu Jo-Hsi play. Today, he visited Taipei Dome. He praised Lin An-Ko from Uni-Lions, saying he has qualities of a good hitter. Kuriyama said, "Taiwan has many good players, both pitchers and fielders. I want to see them all with my own eyes."</p>
            <p>Many people are talking about Wei Chuan Dragons pitcher Hsu Jo-Hsi and Uni-Lions hitter Lin An-Ko possibly playing abroad after this season. Hideki Kuriyama, who is the Chief Baseball Officer (CBO) for Japan's Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, came to Taiwan. He watched a game at Tianmu Baseball Stadium yesterday and then went to Taipei Dome today to watch the Uni-Lions play against the TSG Hawks.</p>
            <p>Kuriyama spoke to reporters about why he came to Taiwan. He said he came yesterday mainly to see Hsu Jo-Hsi. He also said Taiwan has many good pitchers and hitters, and he wants to see any good player in person. He added that Taiwanese and Japanese cultures are similar, so he believes Taiwanese players can do well in Japan.</p>
            <p>Kuriyama mentioned that the TSG Hawks team has Wang Po-Jung, a fielder who used to play for the Fighters. Last year, the Fighters successfully signed pitcher Gu Lin-Jui-Yang, who came from the Uni-Lions. Uni-Lions pitching coach Pan Wei-Lun also visited the Fighters' spring training earlier this year. So, Kuriyama's team has connections with both Taiwanese teams.</p>
            <p>When asked about his thoughts on Lin An-Ko, the strong hitter for the Uni-Lions, Kuriyama said Lin An-Ko is a very good hitter. But he also said, "The rest is a secret," praising Lin An-Ko for having not only skill and power but also the qualities of a good player.</p>
            <p>Today, Pan Wei-Lun gave Kuriyama a gift. He also acted like a "fan," asking Kuriyama to sign a book for him.</p>
            <p>Kuriyama said that even though he and Pan Wei-Lun didn't interact much when Pan was visiting the Fighters, he observed that Pan Wei-Lun is calm and quiet. He focuses on watching every pitcher. This gives a feeling of safety and stability, which is Pan Wei-Lun's special quality. Even though the visit was short, Kuriyama could feel that Pan Wei-Lun was very serious about learning new things to help his team.</p>

            <h1>Russian Army Launches Largest Air Attack on Kyiv in Three and a Half Years</h1>
            <p>Independent groups say that Russia's army launched one of its biggest attacks on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, early this morning. This was the largest attack in three and a half years. Ukraine's foreign ministry said that Russia fired "hundreds of drones and missiles" at Ukraine all night.</p>
            <p>News agencies AFP and Reuters reported that Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that the Russian air attacks destroyed many homes and "hurt or killed civilians." He asked other countries to make Russia pay a high price if the situation gets worse.</p>
            <p>Also, many drones flew over Kyiv and nearby areas. Air defense forces fought them all night.</p>
            <p>Most citizens went to underground metro stations to find shelter. Air raid warnings were also given in many parts of the country.</p>
            <p>Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said the capital faced a "massive" attack. He asked people to stay in bomb shelters. He wrote on Telegram that five people in Kyiv were hurt and taken to the hospital.</p>
            <p>The leader of the Zaporizhzhia region in southeast Ukraine also said that at least four people there were hurt because of the Russian attacks.</p>
            <p>Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, said, "Homes and important buildings were attacked again. This shows again that this is a war against ordinary people."</p>
            <p>He said, "Ukraine will surely respond to these actions. Western countries must also make their money punishments against Russia stronger."</p>

            <h1>China's Working-Age Population is 60%, Government Says It Still Has an Advantage</h1>
            <p>Today, China's National Bureau of Statistics shared a report about people's lives for the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). China's population started to shrink in 2022. But the report says that in 2024, 60.9% of the total population was between 16 and 59 years old, which is the working age. The report says that China still has a "big advantage in size and benefits from its population."</p>
            <p>According to China's National Bureau of Statistics website and Jiemian News, the report shows that at the end of 2024, China's total population was 1.40828 billion people. The working-age population (16 to 59 years old) was 857.98 million people, which is 60.9% of the total.</p>
            <p>The data shows that more people in China are moving to cities and the eastern parts of the country. At the end of 2024, 943.5 million people lived in cities. The number of people living in cities was 67.00%, which is 3.11 percentage points higher than at the end of 2020. This means more and more people are living in cities. The eastern region had 567.02 million people living there. This is 40.32% of the country's population, an increase of 0.30 percentage points from 2020.</p>
            <p>In 2024, the average life expectancy in China reached 79.0 years, which is 1.07 years longer than in 2020. For people aged 16 to 59, the average number of years they spent in school was 11.21 years. This is 0.46 years more than in 2020.</p>
            <p>At the end of 2024, China had a total of 734.39 million people working. Among them, 473.45 million people worked in cities. This is 10.74 million more people than at the end of 2020, and it makes up 64.5% of all workers in the country. 260.94 million people worked in the countryside, which is 26.99 million fewer people. This group makes up 35.5% of all workers.</p>
            <p>In this context, the service industry (also called the third industry) created more jobs. At the end of 2024, 358.66 million people worked in the service industry. This is 600,000 more people than at the end of 2020. The service industry now makes up 48.8% of all workers in the country, an increase of 1.1 percentage points.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that workers from rural areas in China keep moving to non-farming jobs. The total number of migrant workers is growing. In 2024, there were 299.73 million migrant workers in the country. This is 14.13 million more than in 2020, which is a 4.9% increase. From 2021 to 2024, this number grew by 1.2% each year. From 2021 to 2024, about 130 million migrant workers moved to cities each year, and this number has stayed mostly the same.</p>
            <p>A survey on how migrant workers become city residents showed that in 2024, 44.5% of migrant workers in cities felt they were local residents. This is 3.1 percentage points higher than in 2020. Among migrant workers in cities, 38.2% had joined activities organized by their local community. This is 8.9 percentage points higher than in 2020. This shows that their feeling of belonging to the city and their involvement in social activities are both growing.</p>
