A recent report found that people in the United States are spending almost five hours every day on their mobile phones. This includes around 40 minutes more on social media platforms compared to before. The study highlights that younger people, especially young women, spend even more time online, and this can affect their mental health badly. Many people are now trying to use their phones less, as they realize that too much screen time might not be good for them.

**AI to Impact Many Jobs Worldwide**

The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, has said that artificial intelligence (AI) could change 40% of jobs worldwide. She explained that for richer countries, the effect could be even bigger, possibly affecting 60% of jobs. While AI will take away some jobs, it will also make others better. The IMF believes it's important for governments and businesses to teach workers new skills so they can deal with these changes and use AI to their advantage.
