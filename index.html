            <h1>Financial Times: Trump Tests EU Limits, Wants 15% to 20% Minimum Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Brussels, July 18 (Central News Agency) â€“ Three people with knowledge of the matter said that US President Trump has increased his demands in trade talks with the European Union. He is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% in any agreement made with the EU.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times reported that after several weeks of talks to create an agreement, Trump has become tougher. This move is to see how much the EU can handle. The agreement was supposed to keep the standard tariff for most goods at 10%.</p>
            <p>People familiar with the situation said that Trump was not interested in the EU's latest suggestion to lower tariffs on cars. He said he was happy to continue with the plan to keep a 25% tariff on cars.</p>
            <p>An American official told the Financial Times that even if an agreement is reached, the US government is now thinking about putting a matching tariff rate of more than 10% on EU imports.</p>
            <p>This situation puts the EU in a difficult spot. Trump said that if an agreement is not reached by August 1st, he will put a 30% tariff on all products coming from the EU.</p>
            <p>The EU has said it will act against this move by the US. However, there are different opinions within the EU about whether to take action. The EU might have to accept a base tariff of more than 10% in any agreement.</p>
            <p>EU diplomats said yesterday that if the EU cannot reach a trade agreement with Washington, the EU's main office will prepare a list of planned limits on US service companies, including big technology companies.</p>

            <h1>Former President Bolsonaro Tried for Coup, Brazilian Police Raid Home</h1>
            <p>Brasilia, July 18 (Central News Agency) â€“ After a Brazilian judge limited the freedom of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of trying to overthrow the government, his son said that police raided Bolsonaro's home today.</p>
            <p>According to AFP and Reuters, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who is a member of parliament and recently went to the US to support his father, wrote on social media platform X that federal police "raided my father's home this morning."</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro strongly criticized his opponent, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. Today, Moraes ordered that the far-right former president wear an electronic ankle monitor and not leave his home at night.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro is accused of trying to stop the left-wing Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva from winning the 2022 presidential election. Moraes is one of the judges in this case. Moraes said that these actions were needed because of the "hostile actions" of Bolsonaro and his son towards Brazil.</p>
            <p>Before this, US President Trump announced a 50% tariff rate on Brazil. He said this was because Brazil was "hunting" his ally, Bolsonaro.</p>
            <p>After Brazilian federal police raided Bolsonaro's home and political party office, he told Reuters in an interview that he would meet with Trump if he got his passport back.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro's passport was taken last year by order of Judge Moraes. Today, Moraes increased the search and restrictions on Bolsonaro because Bolsonaro is suspected of working with Trump to interfere with his trial for the alleged coup attempt.</p>
            <p>Also, Bolsonaro told Reuters that he wants his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who is a member of parliament, to try to become a US citizen and not return from the US.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro said he talks to his son at least every two days. Eduardo Bolsonaro speaks his mind and is an ally of Trump. He is currently in Washington to get support for his father.</p>
