            <h1>Trump: If the US and China don't agree on trade, I won't meet with Xi Jinping</h1>
            <p>People are wondering when President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet. Today, Trump said that if the US and China make a trade deal, he will likely meet Xi Jinping by the end of this year. But if they don't make a deal, he will not meet with Xi Jinping. Trump also said that the two sides are very close to reaching an agreement.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke on the phone on a TV show. When asked about meeting Xi Jinping, he said that Xi Jinping asked to meet him. If the US and China agree on a deal, he will probably meet Xi Jinping before the end of this year. "If we don't make a deal, there will be no meeting," he said.</p>
            <p>He added that if they don't reach a deal, "what's the point of meeting?" But he also stressed that the US and China are now very close to a deal, and "we are getting along well with China."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, said last week that he thinks the US and China can make a deal. Before this, officials from both countries had their third round of trade talks in Sweden in late July. They were trying to solve economic problems and extend a break from tariffs that started in mid-May.</p>
            <p>The United States and China had an agreement in Geneva in May. They greatly reduced high tariffs for 90 days. This break in the trade war will end on August 12. The US and China had already made early agreements in May and June. They were trying to stop new tariffs and China from stopping rare earth mineral exports. Now, as the August 12 deadline is coming, China needs to make a lasting agreement about tariffs with the United States.</p>

            <h1>Report: Intel's 18A process has only 10% good chips, new processors might be sold at a loss</h1>
            <p>Reuters, quoting people who know about the matter, reported that Intel's plan to make its next-generation high-end laptop processor, Panther Lake, using its 18A process, has big problems. This summer, only 10% of the chips made are good enough. This means that Intel might not make money from these chips.</p>
            <p>The report said that Intel used to mainly design and make its own chips, and sometimes hired TSMC to make some. Now, Intel wants to grow its business and become a chip manufacturer that can compete with TSMC. But first, it needs to catch up technologically with TSMC, which used to be its main supplier.</p>
            <p>Last year, early tests of the 18A process did not satisfy customers. But Intel later said that 18A was going well and that they could start making a lot of Panther Lake chips this year.</p>
            <p>Panther Lake has new kinds of transistors and uses power more efficiently. Intel hopes that making this advanced chip with its own design using the 18A process will make other companies interested in its chip-making services.</p>
            <p>However, two people who saw Intel's test production data since the end of last year said that only a small number of Panther Lake chips made recently were good enough to sell to customers. Such a low number of good chips means Intel might not make a profit from this chip soon.</p>
            <p>In April this year, Intel said it started an important "risk production" step for Panther Lake chips using the 18A process. In May, Intel also showed several laptops with Panther Lake at Computex Taipei. But problems still exist.</p>
            <p>The report noted that one way chipmakers count good chips is by checking how many mistakes are on each part of a chip. The way they calculate this can change based on the chip's design.</p>
            <p>But the two sources said that the Panther Lake processors made now have about three times more mistakes than normal for the industry. This stops Intel from starting to make them in large amounts.</p>
            <p>According to these sources, by the end of last year, only 5% of the Panther Lake chips Intel made met the needed standards. One of the sources said that by this summer, the number of good chips only went up to about 10%.</p>
            <p>But this person warned that Intel might say the number of good chips is higher if they include chips that don't meet all the performance goals. Reuters could not confirm the exact number of good chips.</p>
            <p>Two people who know about Intel's manufacturing said that it will be very hard to make many more good chips to sell Panther Lake in the fourth quarter of this year. If they don't improve enough, Intel might have to sell some chips with very little profit or even at a loss.</p>

            <h1>With Government-Linked Support, Taiwan Smart Energy Gets AA+ Rating from Fitch</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Smart Energy (TWE) announced today that it received a credit rating from Fitch Ratings. It got an "A" for its long-term credit rating as a company and "AA+ (twn)" for its long-term rating in Taiwan. The future looks stable. This is mainly because the company has support from government-linked shareholders. Fitch believes the government can provide more help if needed.</p>
            <p>TWE said that besides Fitch Ratings, it also got an "A-" international long-term credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P) and a "twAA+" domestic long-term rating from Taiwan Ratings. Both are good ratings for investors.</p>
            <p>In July, the Fair Trade Commission approved the plan for Taiwan Smart Energy Company to join with others. This means six companies, including China Steel, CPC, Chunghwa Telecom, ASE, UMC, and Tung Ho Steel, will work together to buy and sell electricity. TWE recently finished getting new money, adding NT$1.55 billion. Now, it has 14 shareholders.</p>
            <p>TWE's 14 shareholders include CPC, Chunghwa Telecom, China Steel, Taiwan High Speed Rail, Yao Hwa Glass, ITIC, ASE Technology Holding, UMC, Chang Chun Petrochemical, Tung Ho Steel, TECO Group, Sino-American Silicon, Delta Electronics, and Vanguard International Semiconductor. Each company owns about 5% to 12.5% of the shares. Companies linked to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Transportation and Communications together own more than half of the shares.</p>
            <p>Fitch said that because it sees TWE as a company that serves public policy and is strongly connected to the government, Fitch "looks through" TWE's direct shareholders to the Taiwan government (AA/stable). Fitch strongly believes the Taiwan government will give more help to TWE if needed.</p>
            <p>Fitch pointed out that the Taiwan government was deeply involved in creating TWE. Fitch expects the government, through its related companies, to keep most of the shares in TWE. This will give the government strong influence over TWE. By the end of 2025, government-related companies will own 52.3% of TWE's shares and choose 4 out of the 7 members on the board of directors.</p>
            <p>According to the shareholder agreement, any change in TWE shares must be approved by at least 50% of the shares. This will make sure the government keeps control.</p>
            <p>Fitch also said that TWE will not need any financial help beyond the first NT$1.65 billion given by the end of 2025. Fitch expects TWE will need very little regular help from the government budget. This is because its shareholders will take over contracts from buyers who cannot pay. This ensures the company can meet its contract duties.</p>
            <p>Fitch stated that the financial health of TWE's shareholders is good. This helps them take on contracts that go wrong. Especially, government-linked shareholders use over 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year. If needed, they can completely use TWE's expected supply of 4 billion kilowatt-hours. The financial strength of these shareholders is related to the country's credit or they have a rating of "A" or higher.</p>
            <p>However, Fitch rates TWE's own financial health as "bbb." A main reason for this is that the sales contracts have fixed profit margins. This stops TWE from raising prices when costs go up. Because of this, the risk to its income is seen as "weak."</p>
            <p>TWE said it has already talked with companies developing offshore wind farms for blocks 3-1 and 3-2. After the new board of directors is formed, they will start evaluating and deciding on purchases. A board meeting is expected by the end of August.</p>
