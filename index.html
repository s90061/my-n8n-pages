            <h1>Taiwan's Women's Archery Team Gets Silver at Universiade, Loses to Japan</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Li Jian-zhong, Taipei, July 25) Today, at the Universiade in Germany, the women's recurve archery team final was held. Taiwan's team, with Guo Zi-ying, Li Cai-xuan, and Feng You-zhu, played against Japan. Taiwan did not play well in the last two rounds and lost 2 to 6. This means Taiwan won another silver medal.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's women's recurve archery team did not have to play in the first round. In the round of 16, they won against Italy 5 to 4. In the quarter-finals, they easily beat India 5 to 1. In the semi-finals, they beat China 5 to 3. So, they successfully reached the final match for the gold medal.</p>
            <p>Before the game started today, the temperature was a bit low. In the first round, Taiwan's women's team started strongly. With Feng You-zhu's last arrow, which scored 10 points, they won by a small margin, 56 to 55. They got a 2 to 0 lead in points, starting the game well.</p>
            <p>However, in the second round, Taiwan's women's team lost 54 to 56. The game changed in the third round. It started raining, and the wind became stronger. This directly affected how well Taiwan's women's team played.</p>
            <p>In the third round, Guo Zi-ying, who shot first, still hit a 10-point arrow. But then, Li Cai-xuan and Feng You-zhu shot 9 and 8 points. When it was Guo Zi-ying's turn again, she unexpectedly shot a 7-point arrow. In the end, they lost that round 52 to 58.</p>
            <p>In the very important fourth round, Taiwan's women's team had to win to get an extra game. But in the first set of three arrows, they scored 8, 8, and 7 points, which caused them to lose. Finally, they lost to Japan again, 52 to 56. Their total score was 2 to 6, so they won a silver medal.</p>
            <p>Japan's performance was more steady. In all four rounds, their scores were above 55 points. Uehara Ruka, who shot first, hit 10 points with all 8 of her arrows in the four rounds. Four of these arrows even hit the center of the target. Her performance was very impressive.</p>
            <p>In the Universiade women's recurve archery team event, Taiwan won its only gold medal in 2015 at the Gwangju Universiade. Lin Shi-jia, who was on that team, is now the coach for this year's women's team. But sadly, they could not win the gold medal this time.</p>
            <p>Also, in the men's recurve archery team bronze medal match, Taiwan's team, led by Guo Yu-cheng, Tang Chih-chun, and Su Yu-yang, played against Turkey. They unfortunately lost 0 to 6 and finished in 4th place. (Edited by Lin Shu-hui) 1140725</p>

            <h1>Baseball Player Chan Tzu-Hsien Wins MVP After His Son Is Born, Jokes His "Salted Egg Superman" Has Changed</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Taipei, July 25) Chan Tzu-Hsien, a player for the CTBC Brothers in Taiwan's baseball league, has had good luck "after his child was born." Today, he hit 3 times and helped his team score 2 runs. This helped his team win 5 to 0 against the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions. It was also the Lions' "Ultraman" themed day. Chan Tzu-Hsien laughed and said that his "Salted Egg Superman" from when he was a child has also gotten better.</p>
            <p>The Brothers played against the Lions at Taipei Dome today. Chan Tzu-Hsien hit 3 times and got 2 RBIs. He was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the game. His son, "Yilu," was born on the evening of July 21st. He joked that he felt the good luck "after having a child," and his mood also got better. But he thought the MVP award should go to shortstop Chiang Kun-yu. He said, "Kun-yu saved many balls. Good defense is always a tradition for the Brothers."</p>
            <p>Chan Tzu-Hsien said he knew that the Lions had won 11 games in a row before today's game with their "Ultraman" theme. He said that even if a team is very strong, they can still lose, just like the Brothers' "Cool Water Festival." He did not think about the opponent but focused on doing what he needed to do in the game.</p>
            <p>Chan Tzu-Hsien shared that he only found out a few years after playing professional baseball that his cheering song came from "Ultraman." He also laughed and said that when he was little, he called it "Salted Egg Superman." He joked that even "Salted Egg Superman" has gotten better. He also added that because he does not pay much attention, some characters look so different that he cannot tell who the bad guy is anymore.</p>
            <p>When asked if he remembered any special cartoons from his childhood, Chan Tzu-Hsien said he remembered watching "Anpanman" in the mornings. In the afternoons after school, "Dragon Ball" and "The Powerpuff Girls" would be on. But his parents controlled how much TV he watched, so he did not watch a lot. He said, "That's why my eyes are so healthy." (Edited by Chang Ming-kun) 1140725</p>

            <h1>Pitcher Brandon Leibrandt Wins First Game, Brothers Team Ends Lions' "Ultraman" Winning Streak</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Taipei, July 25) Today, the CTBC Brothers team in Taiwan's professional baseball league won against the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions team 5 to 0. This happened because pitcher Brandon Leibrandt played well for 6 innings without letting the other team score, and player Chan Tzu-Hsien hit 3 times and helped score 2 runs. This ended the Lions' winning streak on their "Ultraman" themed day. The Brothers' head coach, Hirano Keiichi, laughed and said that Ultraman was on the Brothers' side today.</p>
            <p>The Brothers played against the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions today at the Taipei Dome. It was also the first game of the Lions' "Ultraman" theme day. 17,711 people came to watch. Before today's game, the Lions had won all 11 games on their "Ultraman" theme days.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 2nd inning, Chan Tzu-Hsien got the first hit for the Brothers. After two players were out, Tseng Sung-en hit the ball and scored the first run. In the top of the 3rd inning, Kao Yu-chieh got a walk. Chang Jen-wei hit a ground ball that caused the Lions to make a mistake in defense. Chiang Kun-yu got a hit, moving the runners forward. After two players were out, Chan Tzu-Hsien hit the ball again, bringing in 2 runs.</p>
            <p>The Brothers started to score again in the top of the 6th inning. After two players were out, Sung Sheng-jui got a walk, and Chang Jen-wei hit a double, adding another important run for the team. In the top of the 9th inning, after one player was out, Chang Jen-wei got a walk, and Chiang Kun-yu was hit by the ball, so he also got on base. Wang Wei-chen, who came in to bat, got a hit that brought in a run.</p>
            <p>Brothers' starting pitcher, Brandon Leibrandt, threw 96 balls in total today over 6 innings. He allowed 4 hits, struck out 5 batters, and gave 2 walks. He did not let the other team score any runs and got his first win in Taiwan's professional baseball league. Brothers' player Chan Tzu-Hsien hit 3 times and helped score 2 runs in the game. He was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the game.</p>
            <p>The Brothers' head coach, Hirano Keiichi, said after the game that he knew the Lions had won 11 games in a row before this themed day. He said, "But today, Ultraman was on our side, and I like Ultraman very much, so we could not lose today."</p>
            <p>Before today, Brandon Leibrandt had started 3 games and lost 2 of them. Today, he pitched well for 6 innings and won. Hirano Keiichi said that Leibrandt had some things to work on before, like how to pitch against batters, and how to use his special pitches and fastballs. He did not say everything, but he noted that Leibrandt's ball speed was not very fast today. However, he did well by using different speeds to confuse the batters, making it hard for them to hit the ball at the right time.</p>
            <p>Hirano Keiichi also said that in Asian baseball, teams often move around a lot to put pressure on the pitcher. Today, Brandon Leibrandt was able to stop the Lions' plan well. He felt that Leibrandt was thinking about what kind of pitcher he wanted to be. (Edited by Chang Ming-kun) 1140725</p>
