            <h1>Youtuber Sun Sheng Accused of Sexual Crimes, Prosecutors Ask for Severe Punishment</h1>
            <p>Sun Sheng, a member of the YouTube group "Wackyboys," is accused of serious sexual crimes. He is said to have sexually assaulted a teenage girl by inviting her to watch him practice dancing. He is also accused of touching two adult women improperly during filming or chatting. Additionally, he allegedly showed videos of sexual acts with an adult woman to his friends without her permission. Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office charged him with crimes against sexual autonomy and other laws. They have asked the court to give him a very strict punishment.</p>
            <p>According to the indictment from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, on the evening of October 5, 2022, Sun Sheng went to an adult woman's (A1) home for a haircut. After the haircut, they talked on the balcony while smoking. Sun Sheng allegedly touched A1 improperly against her will.</p>
            <p>In the early morning of March 17, 2023, Sun Sheng was filming at another adult woman's (A2) home. After filming, while A2 was resting on the bed, he allegedly jumped on her and touched her improperly against her will.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, on the evening of October 13, 2023, Sun Sheng asked a girl (A3) who was under 16 years old to come to his home to watch him dance. While A3 was focused on listening to music, he allegedly sexually assaulted her.</p>
            <p>Separately, on the evening of July 8, 2024, Sun Sheng and an adult woman (A4) stayed in a hotel room in Taipei's Zhongshan District. They recorded 8 videos of their sexual activities. However, Sun Sheng later showed these videos to his friends without A4's permission.</p>
            <p>During the investigation, prosecutors looked at evidence, statements, and phone messages. They believe Sun Sheng broke laws against forced inappropriate touching, showing someone's sexual videos without permission, and personal data protection laws. For the crime against the teenage girl, he is charged with forced sexual intercourse by an adult against a minor.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors said that Sun Sheng is addicted to sex and does not respect other people's right to choose. He used friendships, trust, or work situations to harm many women, including a teenage girl. Afterward, he repeatedly claimed that the victims never said they felt uncomfortable. He always tried to deal with situations he didn't like by using money or emotional pressure. He never thought about his own self-centered way of thinking.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors also said that Sun Sheng treated the victims' sexual videos as his own property and showed them to others freely, which made the victims scared. Even after the police started investigating, he did not reflect on his crimes. This has caused lifelong harm to the victims. He also repeatedly bothered the victims, asking them to lie or not help with the investigation. Because of his bad behavior after the crimes, the prosecutors have asked the court to give him a very strict punishment.</p>

            <h1>Strong Shallow Earthquake Hits Venezuela, Felt in Colombia and Nearby Islands</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported that a 6.2 magnitude earthquake happened today in western and northern Venezuela, including the capital city, Caracas. The Venezuelan government stated that there are no reports of serious damage yet.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the USGS said the earthquake's center was about 24 kilometers from Mene Grande. This is a small oil town with few people in Zulia state. The earthquake was shallow, only 7.8 kilometers deep.</p>
            <p>The Colombian Geological Survey measured the earthquake as 6.1 magnitude and called it a "shallow" earthquake. People also felt the earthquake in nearby Colombia and on the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curacao, and Bonaire.</p>
            <p>In Venezuela, strong earthquakes are not common. Because of the shaking buildings, many people in cities like Caracas, the capital, and Maracaibo became scared.</p>
            <p>Many people went out into the streets to be safe. But the Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, said on state television that the earthquake "did not cause major damage to buildings."</p>
            <p>Venezuela's national earthquake research center, Funvisis, measured the earthquake at a magnitude of 5.4.</p>
            <p>About 80% of people in Venezuela live in areas where earthquakes can happen. However, Venezuela has not had a big earthquake since 1997. That year, an earthquake hit Cariaco in Sucre state in the east, and 73 people died. In 1976, an earthquake in Caracas killed almost 300 people and injured 2,000.</p>
