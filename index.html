            <h1>Hsieh Chien-nan Joins Dawushan as Independent Director; Industry Sees Good Future for Egg Business</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's largest egg farm, Dawushan, announced today the new independent director after a shareholder meeting. It is Hsieh Chien-nan, who has more than 40 years of experience in retail and used to be the vice chairman of Pxmart. People in the industry believe that Dawushan can use his deep experience in retail channels to sell more products and get a bigger share of the market.</p>
            <p>Besides being an independent director for Dawushan, Hsieh Chien-nan is also an independent director for Capital KGI Fund. He has many years of experience in the retail industry. When he was at Uni-President Hypermarket, he helped build information systems, put logistics together, and started many new services. When he was the CEO of 85Â°C, he helped the brand grow around the world, made the supply chain better, and improved stores.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Chien-nan also used to be the vice chairman and CEO of Pxmart. During that time, he created the mobile payment app PX Pay and PXGo! Pxmart Online Shopping. He also built a system that connects all sales channels and made the fresh food supply chain work better. The market expects that his role as an independent director for Dawushan will really help Dawushan with selling products and growing its sales channels.</p>
            <p>Also, in March this year, Dawushan's board decided to buy 51% of the shares of Fuchi Food Company from Guoxing Livestock Company. Fuchi Food is the largest egg processing factory in Taiwan. This will help Dawushan expand its egg processing business.</p>
            <p>Dawushan said that from the second quarter of this year, Fuchi is part of their business and has brought in NT$186 million in revenue. Fuchi's factory in Luzhu, Kaohsiung, can process 200,000 eggs per day. This is about half of its total capacity. They sell fresh egg products like hot spring eggs, soft-boiled eggs, braised eggs, tea eggs, and egg salad through supermarkets and convenience stores in Taiwan. They also sell them to countries like the United States, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. (Editor: Yang Lanxuan) 1140728</p>

            <h1>Xi Jinping: Floods Cause Big Losses; Local Areas Must Be Responsible for Flood Control</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 28) Heavy rains in provinces like Hebei and Beijing, China, have caused serious floods in recent days. Tonight, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping gave instructions. He said that continuous heavy rain in areas like North China has caused many deaths and much damage to property. He told all areas and relevant departments to do a good job in flood control and disaster relief. They also need to "fully take political responsibility" and put flood control measures in place.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported that Xi Jinping said that recently, areas like East China, North China, and Northeast China have had continuous heavy rain. This has led to floods and geological disasters, causing many deaths and much property damage in places like Beijing, Hebei, Jilin, and Shandong. He said it is important to do all flood rescue and disaster relief work well, quickly look for missing and trapped people, move people in danger to safe places, and try to reduce deaths as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that China is now in a very important time for flood control, from late July to early August. He told all areas and relevant departments to have a "bottom-line mindset and extreme mindset." They must "fully take political responsibility" and make sure all flood control measures are carried out in detail. They must carefully watch weak spots and important areas, smartly send rescue teams and relief supplies, and make sure that in case of an emergency, they "respond immediately and deal with it immediately." This is to fully protect the lives and property of the people.</p>
            <p>Besides Xi Jinping, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also gave instructions. He said that the heavy rain and floods in Miyun District, Beijing, have caused many deaths and injuries. He said it is important to quickly look for missing people, take care of the people affected by the disaster, and try to reduce deaths as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Li Qiang mentioned that some parts of North China have had heavy rains recently. He said that China's National Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters should guide relevant local areas to make their plans for heavy rain and flood disasters even stronger. They should also do a good job of monitoring and warning about extreme weather, check river and reservoir dams carefully, and find places in cities that might flood easily. They should move people in danger quickly to truly protect people's lives and property. (Editor: Qiu Guojiang) 1140728</p>
