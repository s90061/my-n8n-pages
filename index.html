            <h1>US Lawmakers Say Chinese Power Bank Company Anker Avoids Taxes, Ask for Investigation</h1>
            <p>News from Washington, September 22. Bloomberg says that important members of the U.S. House of Representatives' China committee have accused Anker. Anker is a Chinese company that makes power banks and other electronic accessories. The lawmakers say Anker might be charging unfair prices and avoiding U.S. import taxes illegally. They want Howard Lutnick, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, to look into this.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News saw a letter from September 19. In the letter, John Moolenaar, a Republican leader, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democratic leader, both from the House Select Committee on China, asked Mr. Lutnick to tell the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate Anker's actions.</p>
            <p>The two lawmakers wrote in the letter that Anker uses several "illegal ways" to avoid U.S. import taxes. For example, they use wrong product codes. Also, they send goods through Southeast Asian countries to illegally skip taxes they should pay.</p>
            <p>They also said that Anker received at least 12 million U.S. dollars (about 363 million New Taiwan dollars) from the Chinese Communist Party in 2023. This helped the company enter the U.S. market in an "unfair way."</p>
            <p>A former Google engineer started Anker. The company became popular in the U.S. electronics market because its chargers and power banks were not expensive. Apple, which makes iPhones, also sells many Anker products in its stores. This means Apple thinks Anker products meet its quality standards.</p>
            <p>Anker sent an email saying they have "started an internal check." They will also hire a U.S. advisor to help find the facts and look at legal issues. After they finish these checks, they will tell the authorities and the public more information.</p>

            <h1>Keelung City Says Money for Social Welfare Might Not Be Enough Even with More Funds</h1>
            <p>News from Keelung, September 22. After changes to the law about how government money is divided, Keelung City expects its income to drop by about 1.7 billion New Taiwan dollars. The city government says this will affect education, city improvements, and social welfare. The biggest cut in social welfare will be for care for people who need it. There might not be enough money for these services in the second half of next year.</p>
            <p>Xie Guoliang said today that Keelung City will get about 7.3 billion New Taiwan dollars more from tax money. But the total money the city gets is not increasing; it is actually decreasing. Right now, the city's total income is only 23.7 billion New Taiwan dollars. This is 1.7 billion less than last year's 25.4 billion.</p>
            <p>Xie Guoliang explained that old special funds are now called general funds. And the old general funds, which were calculated by a formula, are gone. Now, cities have to ask different government departments for them. Also, the amount of money given is lower, and local governments must pay more of their own money.</p>
            <p>Xie Guoliang said the city government wants to do good work. It planned to spend about 30 billion New Taiwan dollars next year, an increase of about 3 billion. But the income is only 23.7 billion. The city government will change next year's budget to still do its planned work. He said he feels like crying, but crying on the floor will not help now.</p>
            <p>The city government said that because there is not enough money, some school buildings that need repairs will be fixed later. At least 5 fewer parking lots will be built. Work on sewage pipes will also slow down. There will be fewer road repair projects. Money for fixing park facilities will also be cut.</p>
            <p>For social welfare, the city government said the biggest cut will be for care services. There might not be enough money in the second half of next year. Also, new social welfare plans, like a trial program for elderly cards with 480 points and a policy for postpartum caregivers, cannot start on time.</p>
            <p>Han Shiyu, a Keelung City council member from the KMT party, said Keelung City is changing now. The city government wants to make Keelung Port the biggest home port for cruise ships in Taiwan. This needs money for advertising and many other city improvements. He hopes the central government will keep giving money.</p>
            <p>Chen Guanyu, a Keelung City council member who is not part of a party, said the city government has not shown a full plan for the city. But it plans to spend more than 1 billion New Taiwan dollars on electric scooters for young people, which seems like its most important plan for the next three years. He said next year's budget should be carefully planned to save money and not borrow too much.</p>
            <p>Chen Guanyu added that making tourism better should not just be about fireworks shows every season. The city should really promote "Keelung City's 400th Anniversary." Also, the city should not spend 30 million New Taiwan dollars to support a Super Basketball League (SBL) team. The city must keep its promises and find sponsors to share the costs. Xie Guoliang needs to make choices and avoid spending money on one-time, showy events again.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Girls' Basketball Team Wins First Game Against Korea in U16 Asia Cup</h1>
            <p>News from Taipei, September 22. The U16 Asia Cup Girls' Basketball game is happening in Malaysia. Today, the Taiwan team played its first game against Korea. They almost lost after Korea made a strong comeback. But Lin Nian-zhen stepped up and scored 26 points, the most in the game. In the end, Taiwan won a close game, 88 to 83, getting their first win of the competition.</p>
            <p>The U16 Asia Cup Girls' Basketball game officially started today. For the first part of the competition, 8 teams are divided into two groups. The team that finishes first in its group goes straight to the semi-finals (top 4 teams). Teams that finish second or third in their group must play an extra game to try and get into the semi-finals. Taiwan is in Group A with Australia, the Philippines, and Korea. Their main goal is to finish first in their group.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's girls' basketball team fought hard in their first game against Korea today to get a good start. In the first quarter, the game was very close. But in the second quarter, Taiwan played very strongly. Lin Nian-zhen, Gao Zi-qiao, and Zhang Yu-tong, who are like three key players, worked together. They helped Taiwan score a lot, getting 35 points in just that quarter. At the same time, their defense only let Korea score 11 points. So, Taiwan was ahead by 20 points when they went for halftime.</p>
            <p>However, after halftime, the Taiwan team did not play as well. They could not stop Korea's strong comeback. Also, Taiwan missed many chances to score when players were open. This made the score difference become very small. Luckily, Lin Nian-zhen made a winning "three-point play" near the end of the game. This made sure Taiwan would not lose. In the end, they won by 5 points in a close game. Tomorrow, they will play against the Philippines.</p>
            <p>In this game, four players from Taiwan scored 10 points or more. Lin Nian-zhen scored the most points with 26, including 3 three-pointers, and also got 9 rebounds. Zhang Yu-tong scored 21 points and had 8 rebounds. Gao Zi-qiao showed she could do many things, scoring 16 points, making 7 assists, and stealing the ball 5 times.</p>
