Your morning coffee might cost more soon. Bad weather in coffee-growing areas like Brazil and Vietnam is hurting the coffee bean crops. This means there are fewer coffee beans available, and prices for coffee are going up around the world. Coffee shops and supermarkets may need to charge more for your daily cup. Consider trying a cheaper tea or making coffee at home to save money. Farmers are working to find ways to grow coffee even with the changing weather.

**Work**

Many companies are now offering a four-day work week. Instead of working five days, employees work only four, but they still get paid the same amount. Some studies show that people are happier and more productive when they have a longer weekend. They feel less stressed and have more time for family and hobbies. However, a four-day work week may not work for every job. Some jobs need to be done every day. Companies need to think carefully if itâ€™s right for their employees and customers.

**Travel**

Flying is getting more expensive. The price of airplane tickets has increased because of rising fuel costs and more people wanting to travel after the pandemic. Airlines are also dealing with staff shortages. To find cheaper flights, try booking your tickets in advance, traveling during the week instead of weekends, and being flexible with your destination. You can also look for budget airlines that offer lower prices but may have fewer extras.
