        const text = `**AI Expected to Reshape UK Job Market, Report Says**

A new report suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could significantly change the UK job market in the coming years. Up to 7.7 million jobs, especially in office support, customer service, and transport, might be affected by AI. The report, from PwC, indicates that AI is likely to automate many routine tasks, potentially leading to job losses in these areas.

The study also found that certain groups could be more affected. Women, younger workers, and those with fewer qualifications might face a greater impact from these changes. However, the report is not entirely negative. It also predicts that AI will create new jobs, improve productivity, and help the economy grow by up to 10%. To adapt, workers may need to learn new skills, and businesses will need to invest in training. This shift highlights the need for governments and companies to prepare the workforce for the future of work with AI.

**Companies Work to Bring Employees Back to the Office**

Many companies are trying new ways to encourage their employees to return to the office, even for a few days a week. After years of remote or hybrid work, some businesses believe that working together in person helps with teamwork and innovation. However, many employees prefer the flexibility of working from home.

To make the office more appealing, employers are offering various benefits. These include free lunches, special coffee, social events, and updated office spaces that are more comfortable and modern. Some companies are also clearly stating their rules about office attendance, sometimes even tracking who comes in. The goal is to find a balance where employees feel supported and productive, while also building a strong company culture that benefits from in-person interaction.

**Europeâ€™s Tourist Hotspots Face Calls to Limit Visitors Amid Heatwaves**

Popular tourist destinations across Europe are facing new challenges: managing large numbers of visitors and dealing with rising temperatures. Places like Venice, Amsterdam, and the Canary Islands are experiencing "overtourism," where too many tourists can harm the environment and put pressure on local resources. This also makes daily life more difficult for residents, sometimes leading to higher housing costs.

As a result, there are increasing calls to limit the number of tourists, introduce higher fees for certain activities, or even ban certain types of tourism. Additionally, extreme heatwaves in summer are making some traditionally popular destinations less attractive, causing tourists to consider visiting during cooler months. This shift highlights the urgent need for a more sustainable approach to tourism that protects both the environment and local communities.`;
