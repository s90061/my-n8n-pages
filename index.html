            <h1>Sun Chia-hung is Taiwan's Flag Bearer at the World Games, Feels Like a Dream</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Chengdu World Games began today with an opening ceremony. Sun Chia-hung, a martial arts athlete, was the first martial arts player to carry the flag for Taiwan. He was very excited and said it felt like a dream come true.</p>
            <p>At the last World Games in Birmingham, Taiwan won 1 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze medals. This time, Taiwan sent 120 athletes to Chengdu to play in 14 different sports. The women's tug-of-war team will try to win their sixth championship in a row in the 500 kg group. This has never happened before.</p>
            <p>At the opening ceremony today, Sun Chia-hung and Huang Mei-chien were the flag bearers for Taiwan. They came into the stadium as the 104th team, placed between Syria and the Czech Republic. Sixty-four athletes joined the event. They played sports like canoe polo, korfball, orienteering, water sports, roller sports, water skiing, martial arts, and tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-hung won a gold medal in Tai Chi boxing and a silver medal in Tai Chi sword at the 2021 Chengdu World University Games. Now, he is in Chengdu again and is the first martial arts athlete to be a flag bearer. He told reporters he was very emotional. He said this moment felt like a dream he had since he was little. He also said, "This is a result of hard work over time. Many older athletes did very well before me. Together, we helped make Taiwan's martial arts famous and well-known in international sports."</p>
            <p>Huang Mei-chien was a swimmer for Taiwan in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Recently, she has spent more time coaching. But she still competes in fin swimming. In 2024, she won a gold medal in the 50-meter bi-fins at the World Fin Swimming Championships. Huang Mei-chien said she has been an athlete's spokesperson and a person who carries the torch before. But this is her first time as a flag bearer. She said, "I am very excited, and a little bit nervous. I want to do this job well."</p>

            <h1>Your Car Is Flooded? Financial Commission Says You Need Extra Insurance for It</h1>
            <p>Recently, heavy rains caused by southwest airflows hit central and southern Taiwan badly. Many cars were flooded. Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that car insurance usually covers different types of damage to the car's body. But these main insurances do not cover damage from typhoons or floods. If you want protection for your car from typhoons, earthquakes, tsunamis, hail, floods, or water from rain, you need to buy an extra part for your insurance policy.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan, who works for the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said today that insurance has two main parts: personal insurance and business insurance. The recent floods in central and southern Taiwan affected many people and businesses. Homes and cars were also damaged. For personal insurance, home fire insurance now includes "Home Typhoon and Flood Insurance." If your home is damaged by a typhoon or flood, and the water is 50 centimeters or higher, you can get between NT$7,000 and NT$9,000. This amount depends on where you live.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen said that if people think the basic insurance is not enough, they can ask for "Extra Typhoon and Flood Insurance." This extra insurance gives more money than the basic one. It also gives NT$3,000 each day for a temporary place to stay, for up to 60 days.</p>
            <p>Also, there have been many mudslides recently. Mr. Chen said that if your house is in a low area or on a hillside, you can add "Land Movement or Landslide Insurance." This insurance helps if your house is damaged by land sinking, moving, or landslides. This can happen because of typhoons or floods, making the ground loose or causing dirt and sand to wash away.</p>
            <p>He also said that many cars were damaged by floods. Current car insurance types A, B, and C for car body damage do not cover damage from typhoons and floods. If you live in a low area and think your car might be damaged by a typhoon or flood, you can buy extra insurance called "Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood, or Water from Rain" to protect your car from these problems.</p>
            <p>For businesses, Mr. Chen said that companies often buy "Commercial Fire Insurance." This insurance covers buildings, machines, and other items if they are damaged by unexpected accidents. This type of insurance already includes damage from typhoons and floods.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Chen also said that "Commercial Fire Insurance" needs to clearly list what it covers. So, it does not cover damage to insured items from typhoons or floods. Businesses can add a "Typhoon and Flood Insurance" part to their policy. This helps them manage the risk of natural disasters. He suggests that businesses talk to their insurance company when they buy insurance to check if the coverage is what they need.</p>

            <h1>Taipower Says New MRT Line Project Damaged Wires, New Taipei MRT Office Will Check</h1>
            <p>Songshan Airport had a power cut tonight. Taipower, the power company, said that the New Taipei City MRT Bureau's Xidong Line building project accidentally dug into and damaged power lines. This caused the power cut. But the New Taipei City MRT Bureau said they are not sure yet if their work caused the power cut. They will let Taipower come and check the site tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>Songshan Airport lost power in the evening. The Civil Aeronautics Administration said the power cut lasted only for 3 or 4 seconds. No flights were affected. Also, other places in the Songshan area lost power. For example, escalators at Nanjing Fuxing MRT Station stopped working.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that after checking, they found that the New Taipei City MRT Bureau's Xizhi-Donghu Line project accidentally damaged power lines. This caused a quick drop in electricity. Because of this, lights at Songshan Airport, Taipei MRT, and Far EasTone company flickered for a short time. Now, Taipower's electricity supply is back to normal.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Government Department of Rapid Transit Systems sent a message to explain. They said that the Xidong MRT Line project was drilling on Tongxing Road in Xizhi District. Taipower gave them a map of high-voltage wires. This map showed that there were no 161KV high-voltage wires underground where they were working. Also, the construction company dug down 2.5 meters and drilled 40 meters, but they did not find any pipes or wires. So, they are not sure if their work caused the power cut.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City MRT Bureau said that because Taipower believes their project caused the problem, they will let Taipower come and check the site tomorrow morning. They will also manage traffic to allow this. This will help them find out the real reason for the power cut.</p>
