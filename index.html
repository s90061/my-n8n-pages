A new study has looked at how using smartphones might change the brains of young people. Researchers found some interesting things about brain activity in teenagers who spent a lot of time on their phones.

The study, published recently, suggests that frequent smartphone use could lead to different patterns in brain activity, especially in parts of the brain that handle attention and emotions. While more research is needed to fully understand these changes and their long-term effects, the findings raise questions for parents and educators.

Experts advise finding a healthy balance with screen time. They suggest encouraging young people to spend time on other activities like sports, reading, or socialising in person. This can help support healthy brain development and overall well-being.

**Artificial Intelligence: A New Help for Workers?**

Many people worry that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will take away jobs. However, a recent report from CNBC suggests that AI could actually help fill empty jobs and make workers more productive.

Instead of replacing humans, AI might become a useful tool for them. For example, AI can handle repetitive tasks, allowing human workers to focus on more creative or complex work. It can also help with training, giving workers new skills for the future.

This means that jobs might change, but new opportunities could also appear. Companies that use AI well could become more efficient. The report highlights that understanding and adapting to AI will be important for both businesses and employees in the coming years.

**Is Travel Becoming Too Popular?**

More and more people are travelling, and some popular places are becoming very crowded. This problem is called "overtourism." A recent article from the BBC asks if 2024 will be the year when tourism reaches its peak, meaning too many people are visiting the same places.

Overtourism can cause problems like damage to natural sites, pressure on local services, and a difficult experience for both tourists and residents. Cities like Venice and Barcelona have already started taking steps to manage the large number of visitors.

To help with this, travelers are now thinking more about "responsible tourism." This means choosing less popular destinations, visiting during off-peak seasons, or supporting local businesses that care about the environment. Governments and travel companies are also looking for ways to spread tourism more evenly and protect popular sites for the future.
