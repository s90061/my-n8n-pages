            <h1>Ukraine Finds Defense Corruption Case: Electronic Warfare and Drone Prices Were Too High</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian authorities said today they have arrested several politicians. These people are involved in a big corruption case in the defense department. Before this, people protested because the independence of Ukraine's two main anti-corruption agencies was taken away. After the protests, the parliament passed a new anti-corruption law.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Ukraine passed a law at the end of July this year. This law took away the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO). It put them under the control of the Prosecutor General. The President appoints the Prosecutor General.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave in on July 31st. He made the two agencies independent again. This happened after strong disagreement from allies and the first street protests against the government in Ukraine since Russia's full invasion in 2022.</p>
            <p>The National Anti-Corruption Bureau said today that it and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office found a case. It was about "systematic stealing of money given by local governments for the needs of the defense forces. It also involved taking and giving large amounts of illegal money."</p>
            <p>The National Anti-Corruption Bureau said that this corruption case involved making the prices of electronic warfare and drone equipment too high. Then, 30% of the contract money was stolen.</p>
            <p>The suspects in the case include a member of parliament, several heads of local and city government offices, members of the National Guard, and leaders of defense companies.</p>
            <p>The National Anti-Corruption Bureau said they have made four arrests so far. But they have not shared the names of the people arrested.</p>
