Because of Typhoon Danas, Kaohsiung has lost over 89 million NT dollars in farm products. The city's Bureau of Agriculture announced today that they have successfully asked for a second round of aid. This help will be for bananas, bitter gourds, and cucumbers. Farmers can apply for this aid from July 10 to July 23.

The Bureau of Agriculture said that the first aid round, for items like watermelons, cantaloupes, and leafy vegetables, started today. The second round, for bananas, bitter gourds, and cucumbers, was approved by the Ministry of Agriculture. Farmers in Kaohsiung can apply from tomorrow until July 23. The city will continue to check and fight for more help.

The Ministry of Agriculture announced that Kaohsiung will give 80,000 NT dollars per hectare for bananas, 56,000 NT dollars per hectare for bitter gourds, and 47,000 NT dollars per hectare for cucumbers. There are also low-interest loans for farmers who need to replant. Farmers who lost 20% or more of their bananas, bitter gourds, or cucumbers should use the "Farm Disaster Photo App" to take pictures. They should then go to their local district office with their ID, seal, bankbook, and land papers before July 23.

**Trump Considers Taking Control of Washington D.C., Hints New York City is Next**

U.S. President Trump said today that his government is thinking about taking over the government of Washington D.C. He also suggested he might do something similar in New York because he doesn't like the main candidates for mayor there.

Reuters reported that Trump has said this about Washington D.C. before. He has criticized the crime rate and other problems in the city, but he hasn't done anything yet.

Trump said during a meeting that his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, is talking closely with Mayor Muriel Bowser, who wants Washington D.C. to become a state.

Trump said, "We have a lot of power in the White House to manage some places if needed. We can manage Washington D.C. I mean, we are thinking about Washington D.C. Wiles is talking closely with Bowser."

Mayor Bowser's office did not want to comment.

Washington D.C. was made in 1790 using land from Virginia and Maryland. Congress controls the city's money, but voters choose the mayor and city council because of the "Home Rule Act." If Trump wants to take over the city, Congress would likely have to pass a law to stop the Home Rule Act, and Trump would have to sign it.

Even though Trump said his government has a good relationship with Bowser, he doesn't like Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who won the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral election in November.

Trump said, "We will fix New York, maybe we need to start by fixing Washington. We will do something for New York. I cannot tell you what it is now, but we will make New York great again."

**Taitung County Councilor Yang Chiu-chen Escapes Safely After Her Car Catches Fire**

Taitung County Councilor Yang Chiu-chen of the Kuomintang party was driving back to her office in Taitung City tonight from the east coast. When she was on Mahenheng Boulevard, her 10-year-old car suddenly caught fire. Luckily, she got out of the car in time and was safe.

Around 8:40 PM tonight, the Taitung County Fire Department received a call about a car fire at the intersection of Mahenheng Boulevard and Qingdao Street in Taitung City. When firefighters arrived, the car was completely on fire, but the driver was safe. The car's horn kept beeping while it burned, and thick smoke filled the air, surprising people nearby.

When reporters arrived, they found out the driver was County Councilor Yang Chiu-chen. She told a reporter that even though her car was 10 years old, it was always serviced on time. "How could this happen?" she asked.

Yang Chiu-chen said that after visiting a grieving family on the east coast, she was going back to her office to rest. As she was driving past where the fire happened, she suddenly felt something strange and saw smoke coming from the driver's side door. She quickly stopped the car on the side of the road and got out. She remembered she had left things in the car and tried to go back, but thankfully, a kind person passing by helped her get her belongings out of the car.

The cause of the fire is still being investigated by the police and fire department.
