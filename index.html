<p>A new survey from the Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute shows that 70% of Americans would support the US sending soldiers to help Taiwan if China attacks it. This number goes up to 78% when people hear why defending Taiwan is important. One main reason is that Taiwan makes a lot of computer chips for the world.</p>

<p>The survey also found that people believe defending Taiwan is important for other friendly countries like Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. If the US does not help Taiwan, it might show China and other enemies that the US will not stand up for its friends.</p>

<p>Americans are also worried about China's threats. They are concerned about China stealing technology, not respecting human rights, and making its army bigger. They also worry about Chinese phone companies in the US, China watching the US with satellites, and China buying land near US military bases.</p>

<p><b>First Heatwave of 2025 Hits Southern Europe, Firefighters Busy</b></p>

<p>Southern Europe is facing its first heatwave of 2025, with very hot weather making firefighters work hard. Weather forecasts say the heat will get even stronger in the next few days.</p>

<p>Wildfires have started in France and Turkey, and other countries are ready for more. Governments in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France are telling people to stay safe from the extreme heat, especially those who are more likely to get sick from it.</p>

<p>Experts say that heatwaves will happen more often because of climate change. Many cities in Italy, like Milan, Naples, and Rome, are under a high heat warning. Southern Portugal, including its capital Lisbon, is also under a strong heat alert until tomorrow night.</p>
